Section 2. Conversion. The holders of Series B Preferred Stock and Series A Preferred
Stock shall have conversion rights as follows (the "Conversion Rights"):

(a) Right to Convert; Conversion Price. Each share of Series B Preferred Stock
and Series A Preferred Stock shall be convertible, without the payment of any additional
consideration by the holder thereof and at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the
date of issuance of such share, at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for the Series
EB Preferred Stock and Series A Preferred Stock, into such number of fully paid and non-
assessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing $1.85, in the case of the Series
B Preferred Stock, and $1.00, in the case of the Series A Preferred Stock, (in each case, subject
to equitable adjustment whenever there shal] occur a change in the capital structure of the Series
B Preferred Stock and Series A Preferred Stock, respectively) by the Series B Conversion Price
and Series A Conversion Price, respectively, determined as hereinafter provided, in effect at the
time of conversion. The Series B Conversion Price and Series A Conversion Price at which
shares of Common Stock shall be deliverable upon conversion of Series B Preferred Stock and
Series A Preferred Stock, respectively, without the payment of any additional consideration by

10091405 8 A

the holder thereof (respectively, the “Series B Conversion Price” and "Series A Conversion
Price”) shall initially be $1.85 per share of Common Stock for the Series B Preferred Stock and
$1.00 per share of Common Stock for the Series A Preferred Stock. Such initial Series B
Conversion Price and Series A Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment, in order to adjust
the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Series B Preferred Stock and Series A
Preferred Stock is convertible, as hereinafter provided.

The right of conversion with respect to any shares of Preferred Stock which shall have
been called for redemption under Section 6 hereof shall terminate at the close of business on the
day fixed for redemption unless the Corporation shall default in the payment of the redemption
price, in which case the right of conversion with respect to such shares shall continue unless and
until such redemption price is paid in full.

(b) Automatic Conversion.

(i) Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into

shares of Common Stock at the Series A Conversion Price or Series B Conversion Price, as the
case may be, then in effect upon the closing of a firm commitment underwritten public offering
lead by a investment banking firm acceptable to the holders of a majority of the then outstanding
Series B Preferred Stock pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended, covering the offer and sale of Common Stock for the account of the
Corporation to the public at an offering price per share of not less than $3.70 per share, if such
public offering is closed on or before July 31, 2008, or $5.55 per share, if such public offering is
closed after July 31, 2008 (in each case as adjusted to reflect any stock dividends, distributions,
combinations, reclassifications or other like transactions effected by the Corporation in respect of
its Common Stock) and with gross proceeds to the Corporation of not less than $50,000,000
(prior to underwriters’ discounts and commissions) (in the event of which offering, the person(s)
entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of the Preferred Stock shall
not be deemed to have converted the Preferred Stock until the closing of such offering).

(ii) Each share of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred
Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the Series A Conversion
Price or Series B Conversion Price then in effect, as the case may be, upon the written election of
the holders of at least two-thirds of the then outstanding shares of the Series B Preferred Stock to
require such mandatory conversion.

(c) Mechanics of Automatic Conversions. Upon the occurrence of an event
specified in Subsection 2(b), the applicable series of Preferred Stock shall be converted
automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the
certificates represenging such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or itg transfer agent;
provided, however, that all holders of shares of Preferred Stock being converted shall be given
written notice of the occurrence of the event specified in Subsection 2(b) triggering such
conversion, including the date such event occurred (the "Mandatory Conversion Date”), and the
Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion unless certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock
being converted are either delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent, or the holder notifies

100914058 5

the Corporation or any transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen, or destroyed
and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from
any loss incurred by it in connection therewith. On the Mandatory Conversion Date, all rights
with respect to the applicable series of Preferred Stock so converted shall terminate, except any
of the rights of the holder thereof, upon surrender of the holder's certificate or certificates
therefor, to receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which such series
of Preferred Stock has been converted, together with cash in an amount equal to all dividends
declared but unpaid on, and any and all other amounts owing with respect to, the shares of
Preferred Stock converted to and including the time of conversion. Upon the automatic
conversion of the Preferred Stock, the holders of such Preferred Stock shall surrender the
certificates representing such shares at the office of the Corporation or of its transfer agent. If so
required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shail be endorsed or
accompanied by written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the
Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or by the holder's attorney duly authorized in
writing. Upon surrender of such certificates there shall be issued and delivered to such holder, or
to such holder’s nominee or nominees promptly at such office, a certificate or certificates for the
number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Preferred Stock surrendered were
convertible on the date on which such automatic conversion occurred, together with cash in an
amount equal to ali dividends declared but unpaid on, and any and all other amounts owing with
respect to, the shares of Preferred Stock converted to and including the time of conversion. Upon
the automatic conversion of the Preferred Stock, all shares of Preferred Stock being converted by
any holder thereof shall be aggregated for the purpose of determining the number of shares of
Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled, and no fractional share of Common Stock
shall be issued. Jn lieu of any fractional share to which the holder would otherwise be entitled,
the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair market value of the
Common Stock on the Mandatory Conversion Date, as reasonably determined by the Board of
Directors in good faith.

(d) Mechanics of Optional Conversions. Before any holder of Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock, the holder shall surrender the
certificate or certificates therefor at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for the
Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the Corporation at such office that the holder
elects to convert the same and shall state therein the holder's name or the name or names of the
holder's nominees in which the holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common
Stock to be issued. On the date of conversion, all rights with respect to the Preferred Stock so
converted shall terminate, except any of the rights of the holder thereof, upon surrender of the
holder's certificate or certificates therefor, to receive certificates for the number of shares of
Common Stock into which such Preferred Stock has been converted and cash in an amount equal
to all dividends declared but unpaid on, and any and all other amounts owing with respect to, the
shares of Preferred Stock being converted to and including the time of conversion. Ifso required
by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by
written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly
executed by the registered holder or by the holder's attorney duly authorized in writing. Upon
the optional conversion of the Preferred Stock, all shares of Preferred Stock being converted by
any holder thereof shall be aggregated for the purpose of determining the number of shares of
Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled, and no fractional share of Common Stock

10091405. 8 6

shall be issued. In lieu of any fractional share to which the holder would otherwise be entitled,
the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair market value of the
Common Stock on the date of conversion, as reasonably determined by the Board of Directors in
good faith. The Corporation shall, promptly after surrender of the certificate or certificates for
conversion, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to the holder's
nominee or nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to
which the holder shall be entitled as aforesaid, together with cash in lieu of any fraction of a
share and cash in an amount equal to all dividends declared but unpaid thereon and any and all
other amounts owing with respect thereto at such time. Unless otherwise specified by the holder
in the written notice of conversion, such conversion shall be deemed to have been made
immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred
Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such
shares of Common Stock on such date.

exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, the Series B Conversion Price or Series A Conversion
Price computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with
respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon any such increase or
decrease becoming effective, be recomputed to reflect such increase or decrease insofar as it

time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date the Corporation shal! make or issue, or fix
a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or
other distribution payable in securities of the Corporation other than shares of Common Stock or
securities the issuance of which are deemed to be issuances of Common Stock under Subsection
2(e)(11i), then and in each such event provision shall be made so that the holders of Preferred
Stock shall receive upon conversion thereof in addition to the number of shares of Common
Stock receivable thereupon, the amount of securities of the Corporation that they would have
received had their Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock immediately prior to such
event and had they thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to and including the
conversion date, retained such securities receivable by them as aforesaid during such period,
giving application during such period to all adjustments called for herein.

shares of the applicable Preferred Stock might have been converted immediately prior to such
reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization or change, all subject to further adjustment as
provided herein.

(h) Adjustment for Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets. In the event that, at
any time or from time to time after the applicable Original Issue Date, the Corporation shall

such consolidation, merger or sale is not treated as a liquidation under Subsection 1(c), each
share of Preferred Stock shall thereafter be convertible into the kind and amount of shares of
stock or other securities or property to which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock
of the Corporation deliverable upon conversion of such Preferred Stock would have been entitled
to receive upon such consolidation, merger or sale; and, in such case, appropriate adjustment (as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) shall be made in the application of the
provisions set forth in this Section 2 with respect to the rights and interest thereafter of the
holders of shares of such Preferred Stock, to the end that the provisions set forth in this Section 2

Financing), such holder’s Pro Rata Amount (as defined below), then the Applicable Portion of
the shares of Preferred Stock held by such holder shal-auton a ncaltyand without any further
action on the part of such holder, be converted ito shares of Common Stk at the applicable
Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to th®tvensump lation of suchAQualified Financing,
effective upon, subject to, and concurrently with, the consummation of the Qualified Financing.
For purposes of determining the number of shares of Preferred Stock owned by a holder, and for
determining the number of Offered Securities a holder of Preferred Stock has purchased ina
Qualified Financing, all shares of Preferred Stock held by Affiliates of such holder shall be
aggregated with such holder’s shares and all Offered Securities purchased by Affiliates of such
holder shall be aggregated with the Offered Securities purchased by such holder (provided that
no shares or s¢curities shall be attributed to more than one entity or person within any such group
of affiliated entities or persons). Any such conversion is sometimes hereinafter referred to as a
“Special Mandatory Conversion.”

(ii) Upon a Special Mandatory Conversion, each holder of shares of
Preferred Stock converted pursuant to Section 2(i)(i) shall surrender his, her or its certificate or
certificates for all such shares to the Corporation at the place designated in such notice, and shall

10091405_8 13

thereafter receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to this Section 2(i) and a new certificate for the number of shares, if any, of
Preferred Stock represented by such surrendered certificate and not converted pursuant to
Section 2(i)(i). If so required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be
endorsed or accompanied by written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to
the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or by the holder's attorney duly
authorized in writing. All rights with respect to the Preferred Stock converted pursuant to

the holder's certificate or certificates therefor, to receive certificates for the number of shares of
Common Stock into which such Preferred Stock has been converted, together with cash in an
amount equal to ail dividends declared but unpaid on, and any and all other amounts owing with
respect to, the shares of Preferred Stock converted to and including the time of conversion, and a
new certificate for the number of shares, if any, of Preferred Stock represented by such
surrendered certificate and not converted pursuant to Section 2(i)(i). Upon the conversion of
shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 2(i)(i), all shares of Preferred Stock of any holder
thereof shall be aggregated for the purpose of determining the number of shares of Common
Stock to which such holder shall be entitled, and no fractional share of Common Stock shall be
issued. In lieu of any fractional share to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the
Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair market value of the
Common Stock on the date of such conversion, as reasonably determined by the Board of
Directors in good faith.

(ii!) All certificates evidencing shares of Preferred Stock which are
required to be surrendered for conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof shall, from
and after the time of the Special Mandatory Conversion, be deemed to have been retired and
cancelled, and the shares of Preferred Stock converted pursuant to Section 2(i)(i) represented
thereby shall, from and after the time of the Special Mandatory Conversion, be deemed to have
been converted into Common Stock for all purposes, notwithstanding the failure of the holder or
holders thereof to surrender such certificates on or prior to such date. The Corporation may
thereafter take such appropriate action (without the need for stockholder action) as may be
necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of the applicable series of Preferred Stock

they are entitled. Any interest accrued on funds so deposited and unclaimed by stockholders
entitled thereto shall be paid to such stockholders at the time their respective shares are redeemed
or to the Corporation at the time unclaimed amounts are paid to it. In case the holders of shares
of Preferred Stock which shall have been called for redemption shail not, within one year after
the fina] redemption date, claim the amounts so deposited with respect to the redemption thereof,
any such bank or trust company shall, upon demand, pay over to the Corporation such unclaimed
amounts and thereupon such bank or trust company shall be relieved of all responsibility in
respect thereof to such holder and such holder shall look only to the Corporation for the payment
thereof. Any funds so deposited with a bank or trust company which shall not be required for
such redemption by reason of the exercise subsequent to the date of such deposit of the right of
conversion of any shares or otherwise shall be returned to the Corporation forthwith.

(d) If the Corporation for any reason fails to redeem any of the shares of
Preferred Stock in accordance with Section 6(a) on or prior to the redemption dates determined

such price, which shail accrue at a rate equal to the lesser of (i) one percent (1%) per month or
(ii) the maximum interest rate allowable under applicable law, until such price is paid in full.

(e) If the funds of the Corporation legally available for redemption of shares of
Preferred Stock on a redemption date are insufficient to redeem the total number of shares of ,
Preferred Stock submitted for redemption, those funds which are legally available will be used to
redeem the maximum possible number of whole shares ratably among the holders of such shares.
The shares of Preferred Stock not redeemed shall remain outstanding and entitled to all rights
,and preferences provided herein. At any time thereafter when additional funds of the
Corporation are legally available for the redemption of such shares of Preferred Stock, such
