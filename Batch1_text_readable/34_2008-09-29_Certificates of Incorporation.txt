A Preferred Stock”) and one million three hundred seventy-five thousand (1,375,000) of which
are designated as Series B Preferred Stock (the “Series B Preferred Stock”).

B. Rights, Preferences and Restrictions of Preferred Stock. The rights,
preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to and imposed on the Preferred Stock are as set

forth below in this Article IV(B).
1. Dividend Provisions.

(a) The holders of shares of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive
dividends, out of any assets legally available therefor, prior and in preference to any declaration
or payment of any dividend (payable other than in Common Stock or other securities or rights
convertible into or entitling the holder thereof to receive, directly or indirectly, additional shares
of Common Stock of this corporation), on the Common Stock of this corporation, at the
applicable Dividend Rate for the series of Preferred Stock for each share of Preferred Stock (as
adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, subdivisions, recapitalizations or the
like), payable when, as, and if declared by the Board of Directors of this corporation (the
“Board”). The “Dividend Rate” applicable to each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be
the rate of $0.06675 per annum, and the “Dividend Rate” applicable to each share of Series B
Preferred Stock shall be the rate of $0.14592 per annum, and each such Dividend Rate shail be
pro-rated on an elapsed days basis for periods of less than one year. Such dividends shal! not be
cumulative. The holders of the outstanding Preferred Stock can waive any dividend preference
that such holders shall be entitled to receive under this Section ] upon the affirmative vote or
written consent of the holders of at least sixty percent (60%) of the shares of Preferred Stock
then outstanding (voting together as a single class and not as separate series, and on an as-
converted basis).

(b) After payment of such dividends, any additional dividends or distributions
shall be distributed among all holders of Common Stock and Preferred Stock in proportion to the
number of shares of Common Stock that would be held by each such holder if all outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock were converted to Common Stock at the then effective Conversion
Rate (as defined below).

2. Liquidation Preference.

(a) In the event of any Liquidation Event (as defined below), either voluntary
or involuntary, the holders of Preferred Stock be entitled to receive, prior and in preference to
any distribution of the proceeds of such Liquidation Event (the “Proceeds”) to the holders of
Common Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount per share equal to the sum of the
Original Issue Price (as defined below) for the applicable series of Preferred Stock, plus any and
all declared but unpaid dividends on such share. If, upon the occurrence of such event, the

MMB:10283-005:941370.2 2

Proceeds thus distributed among the holders of the Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit
the payment to such holders of the full aforesaid preferential amount, then the entire Proceeds
legally available for distribution shall be distributed ratably among the holders of the Preferred
Stock in proportion to the full preferential amount that each such holder is otherwise entitled to
receive under this subsection (a). For purposes of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the
“Original Issue Price” applicable to each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall mean
$0.834375 per share, the “Original Issue Price” applicable to each share of Series B Preferred
Stock shall mean $1.824 per share, and each such Original Issue Price shall be adjusted for any
stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, subdivisions, recapitalizations or the like with
respect to such series.

(b) Upon completion of the distribution required by subsection (a) of this
Section 2, all of the remaining Proceeds shall be distributed among the holders of Preferred
Stock and Common Stock pro rata based on the number of shares of Common Stock held by
each (assuming full conversion of all such Preferred Stock).

(c) = (i) For purposes of this Section 2, a “Liquidation Event” shall
include (A) the closing of the sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of this
corporation’s assets, (B) the consummation of the merger or consolidation of this corporation
with or into another entity (except a merger or consolidation in which the holders of capital stock
of this corporation immediately prior to such merger or consolidation continue to hold at least
50% of the voting power of the capital stock of this corporation or the surviving or acquiring
entity), (C) the closing of the transfer (whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise), in one
transaction or a series of related transactions, to a person or group of affiliated persons (other
than an underwriter of this corporation’s securities), of this corporation’s securities if, after such
closing, such person or group of affiliated persons would hold 50% or more of the outstanding
voting stock of this corporation (or the surviving or acquiring entity), (D) the irrevocable
licensing of all or substantially all of the Company’s intellectual party to a third party or (E) a
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of this corporation; provided, however, that a transaction
shall not constitute a Liquidation Event if its sole purpose is to change the state of this
corporation’s incorporation or to create a holding company that will be owned in substantially
the same proportions by the persons who held this corporation’s securities immediately prior to
such transaction. Notwithstanding the prior sentence, the sale of shares of Series A Preferred
Stock or Series B Preferred Stock in a financing transaction shall not be deemed a “Liquidation
Event.” The treatment of any particular transaction or series of related transactions as a
Liquidation Event may be waived by the affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of at
least sixty percent (60%) of the shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding (voting together as a
single class and not as separate series, and on an as-converted basis).

(i) In any Liquidation Event, if Proceeds received are other than cash,
the value will be deemed their fair market value. Any securities shal] be valued as follows:

(A) Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar
restrictions on free marketability covered by (B) below:

(1) ‘If traded on a Securities Exchange (as defined
below), the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such

MMB: 10283-005:94 1370.2 3
exchange or system over the twenty (20) trading day period ending three (3) trading days prior to
the closing of the Liquidation Event;

(2) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall
be deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the
twenty (20) trading day period ending three (3) trading days prior to the closing of the
Liquidation Event; and

(3) If there is no active public market, the value shall be
the fair market value thereof, as determined by the Board.

(B) =‘ The method of valuation of securities subject to investment
letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of
a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount
from the market value determined as above in (A) (1), (2) or (3) to reflect the approximate fair
market value thereof, as determined by the Board.

(C) The foregoing methods for valuing non-cash consideration
to be distributed in connection with a Liquidation Event may be superseded by any determination
of such value set forth in the definitive agreements governing such Liquidation Event.

(ii) ; In the event the requirements of this Section 2 are not
complied with, this corporation shall either:

(A) cause such closing to be postponed until such time as the
requirements of this Section 2 have been complied with; or

(B) cancel such transaction, in which event the rights,
preferences and privileges of the holders of Preferred Stock shall revert to and be the same as
such rights, preferences and privileges existing immediately prior to the date of the first notice
referred to in subsection 2(c)(iii) hereof.

(iii) This corporation shall give each holder of record of
Preferred Stock written notice of such impending Liquidation Event not later than twenty (20)
days prior to the stockholders’ meeting called to approve such transaction, or twenty (20) days
prior to the closing of such transaction, whichever is earlier, and shall also notify such holders in
writing of the final approval of such transaction. Such notice shall describe the material terms
and conditions of the impending transaction and the provisions of this Section 2. The transaction
shall in no event take place sooner than twenty (20) days after this corporation has given such
notice provided for herein; provided, however, that such period may be shortened upon the
affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of Preferred Stock that (i) are entitled to such
notice rights or similar notice rights and (ii) represent at least sixty percent (60%) of the voting
power of all then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class and not
as separate series, and on an as-converted basis). The holders of the outstanding Preferred Stock
can waive the notice requirements described in this subsection (iii) upon the affirmative vote or
written consent of the holders of at least sixty percent (60%) of the shares of Preferred Stock
then outstanding (voting together as a single class and not as separate series, and on an as-
converted basis).

MMB: 10283-005:94 1370.2 4
3. Redemption. The Preferred Stock is not redeemable at the option of the
holder.

4, Conversion. The holders of Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights
as follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at
the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share, at the office
of this corporation or any transfer agent for such stock, into such number of fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the applicable Original
Issue Price for such series by the applicable Conversion Price {as defined below) for such series
(the rate at which each share of a given series of Preferred Stock converts into Common Stock is
referred to herein as such series’ “Conversion Rate”), determined as hereafter provided, in
effect on the date the certificate is surrendered for conversion. The initial “Conversion Price”
per share for each series of Preferred Stock shall be such series’ applicable Original Issue Price;
provided, however, that the Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock shall be subject
to adjustment as set forth in subsection 4(d).

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shal] automatically
be converted into shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Rate at the time in effect for the
applicable series of Preferred Stock immediately upon the earlier of (i) this corporation’s sale of
its Common Stock in a firm commitment underwritten public offering where (A) the public
offering price of which was not less than $25,000,000 in the aggregate and (B) in connection
with such offering the corporation’s stock is to be primarily traded on the Nasdaq Global Market,
the New York Stock Exchange or another comparable exchange or marketplace approved by the
Board, including each Series A Director (as defined below) (each, a “Securities Exchange”)
(such offering, as described in the immediately preceding clauses (A) and (B), shall be referred
to herein as a “Qualified Public Offering”) or (ii) the date specified by written consent or
agreement of the holders of at least sixty percent (60%) of the shares of Preferred Stock then
outstanding (voting together as a single class and not as separate series, and on an as-converted
basis).

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to voluntarily convert the same into shares of Common Stock, he or she shal! surrender
the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of this corporation or of any
transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to this corporation at its
principal corporate office, of the election to convert the same and shall state therein the name or
names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued. This
corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder
of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for
the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid. Such
conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the
date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons
entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated
for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock as of such date.
If the conversion is in connection with an underwritten offering of securities registered pursuant
to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the conversion may, at the option of any holder

MMB: 10283-005:941370.2 5
tendering Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters
of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering, in which event the persons entitled to receive
the Common Stock upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have
converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities.
If the conversion is in connection with Automatic Conversion provisions of subsection 4(b)(ii)
above, such conversion shall be deemed to have been made on the conversion date described in
the stockholder consent approving such conversion, and the persons entitled to receive shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record
holders of such shares of Common Stock as of such date.

(d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock for Certain Dilutive
Issuances, Splits and Combinations. The Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock
shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

(i) (A) If this corporation shall issue, on or after the
date upon which this Restated Certificate of Incorporation is accepted for filing by the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware (the “Filing Date”), any Additional Stock (as defined below)
without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Conversion Price applicable
to a series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional
Stock, the Conversion Price for such series in effect immediately prior to each such issuance
shall forthwith (except as otherwise provided in this clause (i)) be adjusted to a price determined
by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number
of shares of Common Stock Outstanding (as defined below) immediately prior to such issuance
plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received by this
corporation for such issuance would purchase at such Conversion Price; and the denominator of
which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock Outstanding (as defined below)
immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock. For
purposes of this Section 4(d)(i)(A), the term “Common Stock Outstanding” shall mean and
include the following: (1) outstanding Common Stock, (2) Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of outstanding Preferred Stock, (3) Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
outstanding stock options and. (4) Common Stock issuable upon exercise (and, in the case of
warrants or other rights to purchase Preferred Stock, conversion) of outstanding warrants or other
rights to purchase stock. Shares described in (1) through (4) above shall be included whether
vested or unvested, whether contingent or non-contingent and whether exercisable or not yet
exercisable.

(B) No adjustment of the Conversion Price for
any series of Preferred Stock shall be made in an amount less than one cent per share, provided
that any adjustments that are not required to be made by reason of this sentence shall be carried
forward and shall] be either taken into account in any subsequent adjustment made prior to three
(3) years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward, or shall
be made at the end of three (3) years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment
being carried forward. Except to the limited extent provided for in subsections (E)(3) and (F)(4),
no adjustment of such Conversion Price pursuant to this subsection 4(d)(i) shall have the effect
of increasing the Conversion Price above the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to
such adjustment.

MMB:10283-005:941370.2 . 6

(C) In the case of the issuance of Additional
Stock for cash, the consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before
deducting any reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by
this corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale
thereof.

(D) In the case of the issuance of the Additional
Stock for a consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash
shall be deemed to be the fair market value thereof as determined by the Board irrespective of
any accounting treatment.

(FE) In the case of the issuance of options,
warrants or other rights to purchase or subscribe for Common Stock, securities by their terms
convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock or options, warrants or other rights to
purchase or subscribe for such convertible or exchangeable securities, the following provisions
shall apply for purposes of determining the number of shares of Additional Stock issued and the
consideration paid therefor:

(1) The aggregate maximum number of
shares of Common Stock deliverable upon exercise (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions
to exercisability, including without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into
account potential antidilution adjustments) of such options, warrants or rights shall be deemed to
have been issued at the time such options, warrants or rights were issued and for a consideration
equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in subsections 4(d)(i)(C) and
(d)(i(D)), if any, received by this corporation upon the issuance of such options, warrants or
rights plus the minimum exercise price provided in such options, warrants or rights (without
taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) for the Common Stock covered thereby.

(2) The aggregate maximum number of
shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of, or in exchange (assuming the
satisfaction of any conditions to convertibility or exchangeability, including, without limitation,
the passage of time, but without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) for, any
such convertible or exchangeable securities or upon the exercise of options, warrants or rights to
subscribe for such convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange
thereof shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or such
options, warrants or rights were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration, if any,
received by this corporation for any such securities and related options, warrants or rights
(excluding any cash received on account of accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the
minimum additional consideration, if any, to be received by this corporation (without taking into
account potential antidilution adjustments) upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or
the exercise of any related options, warrants or rights (the consideration in each case to be
determined in the manner provided in subsections 4(d)(i)(C) and (d)(i)(D)).

(3) In the event of any change in the
number of shares of Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to this
corporation upon exercise of such options, warrants or rights or upon conversion of or in
exchange for such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Conversion Price of the Preferred

MMB: 10283-005:941370,2 7
Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, warrants, rights or
securities, shall be recomputed to reflect such change, but no further adjustment shall be made
for the actual issuance of Common Stock or any payment of such consideration upon the
exercise of any such options, warrants or rights or the conversion or exchange of such securities.

(4) Upon the expiration of any such
options, warrants or rights, the termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the
expiration of any options, warrants or rights related to such convertible or exchangeable
securities, the Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or
computed using such options, warrants, rights or securities or options or rights related to such
securities, shall be recomputed to reflect the issuance of only the number of shares of Common
Stock (and convertible or exchangeable securities that remain in effect) actually issued upon the
exercise of such options, warrants or rights, upon the conversion or exchange of such securities
or upon the exercise of the options, warrants or rights related to such securities.

(5) The number of shares of Additional
Stock deemed issued and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to subsections
4(d)(i)(E)(1) and (2) shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or
expiration of the type described in either subsection 4(d)(i)(E)(3) or (4).

(ii} “Additional Stock” shall mean any shares of
Common Stock issued (or deemed to have been issued pursuant to subsection 4(d){i)(E)) by this
corporation on or after the Filing Date other than:

(A) Common Stock issued pursuant to a
transaction described in subsection 4(d)(iii) hereof;

(B} shares of Common Stock issued to
employees, directors, consultants and other service providers for the primary purpose of
soliciting or retaining their services pursuant to plans or agreements approved by the Board;

(C) Common Stock issued pursuant to a
Qualified Public Offering;

(D) Common Stock issued pursuant to the
conversion or exercise of convertible or exercisable securities outstanding on the Filing Date;

(E) Common Stock issued in connection with a
bona fide business acquisition of or by this corporation, whether by merger, consolidation, sale
of assets, sale or exchange of stock or otherwise;

(F} Common Stock issued or deemed issued
pursuant to subsection 4(d}(i)(E) as a result of a decrease in the Conversion Price of any series of
Preferred Stock resulting from the operation of Section 4(d);

(G) Common Stock issued to persons or entities
with which this corporation has business relationships, provided such issuances are for other than
primarily equity financing purposes and provided that such issuances are approved by the Board.

MMB: 10283-005:94 370.2 8
(iii) ‘If this corporation shall, on or after the Filing Date fix a record
date for the effectuation of a split or subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or
the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution
payable in additional shares of Common Stock or other securities or rights convertible into, or
entitling the holder thereof to receive, directly or indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock
(hereinafter referred to as “Common Stock Equivalents”) without payment of any consideration
by such holder for the additional shares of Common Stock or the Common Stock Equivalents
(including the additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof),
then, as of such record date (or the date of such dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no
record date is fixed), the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock shall be
appropriately decreased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion
of each share of such series shall be increased in proportion to such increase of the aggregate of
shares of Common Stock outstanding and those issuable with respect to such Common Stock
Equivalents.

(iv) If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any time
after the Filing Date is decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of Common Stock,
then, following the record date of such combination, the Conversion Price of each series of
Preferred Stock shall be appropriately increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be decreased in proportion to such
decrease in outstanding shares of Common Stock.

(e) Other Distributions. In the event this corporation shall declare a
distribution payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by this
corporation or other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or securities or rights convertible
into, or entitling the holder thereof to receive directly or indirectly, shares of Common Stock,
then, in each such case for the purpose of this subsection 4(e), the holders of the Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any such distribution as though they were the holders
of the number of shares of Common Stock of this corporation into which their shares of
Preferred Stock are convertible as of the record date fixed for the determination of the holders of
Common Stock of this corporation entitled to receive such distribution.

(f) Recapitalizations. If at any time or from time to time there shall be a
recapitalization of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision, combination or merger or sale
of assets transaction provided for elsewhere in this Section 4 or Section 2) provision shall be
made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon
conversion of the Preferred Stock the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of
this corporation or otherwise, to which a holder of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion
would have been entitled on such recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall
be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 4 with respect to the rights of the
holders of the Preferred Stock after the recapitalization to the end that the provisions of this
Section 4 (including adjustment of the Conversion Price then in effect and the number of shares
purchasable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event in as
nearly equivalent a manner as may be practicable.

(g) No Impairment. This corporation will not, without the appropriate vote, if
any, of the stockholders under the General Corporation Law or Section 6 of this Article I'V(B),

MMB: 10283-005:94 1370.2 9
by amendment of its Certificate of Incorporation or through any reorganization, recapitalization,
transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other
voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be
observed or performed hereunder by this corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in
the carrying out of all the provisions of this Section 4 and in the taking of all such action as may
be necessary or appropriate in order to Protect the Conversion Rights of the holders of the
Preferred Stock against impairment.

(h) No Fractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments.

(i) No fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of
any share or shares of Preferred Stock and the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock to
be issued to particular stockholders shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share and the
corporation shall pay in cash the fair value (as determined by the Board) of any fractional shares
as of the time when entitlements to receive such fractions are determined.

(ii) Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of
the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4, this corporation,
at its expense, shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the
terms hereof and prepare and furnish to each holder of such series of Preferred Stock a certificate
setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such
adjustment or readjustment is based. This corporation shall, upon the written request at any time
of any holder of a series of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like
certificate setting forth (A) such adjustment and readjustment, (B) the Conversion Price for such
series of Preferred Stock at the time in effect, and (C) the number of shares of Common Stock
and the amount, if any, of other property that at the time would be received upon the conversion
of a share of such series of Preferred Stock.

(i) Notices of Record Date, In the event of any taking by this corporation of a
record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof
who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend) or other distribution, this
corporation shall mail to each holder of Preferred Stock, at least ten (10) days prior to the date
specified therein, a notice specifying the date on which any such record is to be taken for the
purpose of such dividend, distribution, and the amount and character of such dividend or
distribution.

(j) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. This corporation shall at
all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock,

solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock, such
number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, in addition to such other remedies as shall
be available to the holder of such Preferred Stock, this corporation will take such corporate
action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes,

MMB: 10283-005:941370.2 10

including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval
of any necessary amendment to this Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

(k) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Section 4 to be
given to the holders of shares of Preferred Stock (i) shall be deemed given if delivered
personally, sent via internationally recognized overnight courier service, via facsimile or
deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to each holder of record at
his address appearing on the books of this corporation and (ii) may be waived by the affirmative
vote or written consent of the holders of at least sixty percent (60%) of the shares of Preferred
Stock then outstanding (voting together as a single class and not as separate series, and on an as-
converted basis).

(1) Waiver of Adjustment to Conversion Price. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary (including, but not limited to, Section 4(g) of this Article IV(B)), any
downward adjustment of the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock may be waived,
either prospectively or retroactively or in a particular instance, by the affirmative vote or written
consent of the holders of at least sixty percent (60%) of the shares of such series of Preferred
Stock then outstanding (voting on an as-converted basis), Any such waiver shall bind all future
holders of shares of such series of Preferred Stock.

(m) Status of Converted Stock. In the event any shares of Preferred Stock
shall be converted pursuant to this Section 4, the shares so converted shall be cancelled and shail
not be issuable by this corporation. This Restated Certificate of Incorporation of this corporation
shall be appropriately amended to effect the corresponding reduction in this corporation’s
authorized capital stock.

5. Voting Rights.

(a) General Voting Rights. The holder of each share of Preferred Stock shall
have the right to one vote for each share of Common Stock into which such Preferred Stock
could then be converted, and with respect to such vote, such holder shall! have full voting rights
and powers equal to the voting rights and powers of the holders of Common Stock, and shall be
entitled, notwithstanding any provision hereof, to notice of any stockholders’ meeting in
accordance with the Bylaws of this corporation, and, shall be entitled to vote, together with
holders of Common Stock, with respect to any question upon which holders of Common Stock
have the right to vote except as required by the General Corporation Law. Fractional votes shall
not, however, be permitted and any fractional voting rights available on an as-converted basis
(after aggregating all shares into which shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder could be
converted) shall! be rounded to the nearest whole number (with one-half being rounded upward).

(b) Voting for the Election of Directors. As long as any shares of Series A

Preferred Stock are outstanding, the holders of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to elect two (2) directors of this corporation at any election of directors (each a “Series A
Director”). The holders of outstanding Common Stock shall be entitled to elect two (2)
directors of this corporation at any election of directors. The holders of Preferred Stock and
Common Stock (voting together as a single class and not as separate classes, and on an as-

MMB: 10283-005:941370.2 11
converted to Common Stock basis) shall be entitled to elect any remaining directors of this
corporation.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 223{a)(1) and 223(a)(2) of the General
Corporation Law, any vacancy, including newly created directorships resulting from any
increase in the authorized number of directors or amendment of this Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, and vacancies created by removal or resignation of a director, may be filled by a
majority of the directors then in office, though less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining
director, and the directors so chosen shall hold office until the next annual election and until their
successors are duly elected and shall qualify, unless sooner displaced; provided, however, that
where such vacancy occurs among the directors elected by the holders of a class or series of
stock, the holders of shares of such class or series may override the Board’s action to fill such
vacancy by (i) voting for their own designee to fill such vacancy at a meeting of this
corporation’s stockholders or (ii) written consent, if the consenting stockholders hold a sufficient
number of shares to elect their designee at a meeting of the stockholders. Any director elected as
provided in the immediately preceding sentence hereof may be removed during the aforesaid
term of office, either with or without cause, by, and only by, the affirmative vote of the holders
of the shares of the class or series of stock entitled to elect such director or directors, given either
at a special meeting of such stockholders duly called for that purpose or pursuant to a written
consent of stockholders, provided, however, that in the case of a director elected by the holders
of Series A Preferred Stock, removal of such director requires the affirmative vote of the holders
of at least sixty percent (60%) of the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock; any vacancy thereby
created may be filled by the holders of that class or series of stock represented at the meeting or
pursuant to written consent.

6. Protective Provisions. So long as any shares of Preferred Stock are
outstanding, this corporation shall not (by amendment, merger, consolidation or otherwise),
