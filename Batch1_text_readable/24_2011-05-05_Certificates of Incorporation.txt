De Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up; Certain Mergers, Consolidations and
Asset Sales.

(a) Preferential Payments to the Series C Preferred Stock Holders. In the

event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation
or a Deemed Liquidation Event (as defined below), after payment or provision for payment of all
debts and liabilities of the Corporation, each holder of shares of Series C Preferred Stock then
outstanding shall be entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Corporation available for
distribution to its stockholders before any payment shall be made to the holders of Series B
Preferred Stock, Series A Preferred Stock or Common Stock, an amount per share of Series C
Preferred Stock held by such holder equal to the Series C Original! Purchase Price (which amount
shall be subject to equitable adjustment whenever there shall occur a stock dividend, stock split,

DMWEST #8191526 v7 3
combination of shares, reclassification or other similar event with respect to the Series C
Preferred Stock) plus an amount equal to all accrued and/or declared and unpaid dividends on the

Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, or such Deemed Liquidation Event, the
remaining assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders shall be
insufficient to pay the holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock the full amount to which
they shall be entitled, the holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock and any class or series of
stock ranking on liquidation on a parity with the Series C Preferred Stock shall share ratably in
any distribution of the remaining assets and funds of the Corporation in proportion to the
respective amounts which would otherwise be payable in respect of the shares held by them upon
such distribution if all amounts payable on or with respect to such shares were paid in full.

(b) Preferential Payments to the Series B Preferred Stock Holders and Series
A Preferred Stock Holders. In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution
or winding up of the Corporation or a Deemed Liquidation Event, after payment or provision for
payment of all debts and liabilities of the Corporation and after payment of all amounts owing to
the Series C Preferred Stock under subsection 2(a), each holder of shares of Series B Preferred
Stock and Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid out of the assets
of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders before any payment shall be made
to the holders of Common Stock, an amount per share of Series B Preferred Stock or Series A
Preferred Stock held by such holder equal to the Series B Original Purchase Price or Series A
Original Purchase Price, as the case may be (which amounts shall be subject to equitable
adjustment whenever there shall occur a stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares,
reclassification or other similar event with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock or Series A
Preferred Stock, respectively) plus an amount equal to all accrued and/or declared and unpaid
dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock or the Series A Preferred Stock, as the case may be. If
upon any such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or
involuntary, or such Deemed Liquidation Event, the remaining assets of the Corporation
available for distribution to its stockholders shall be insufficient to pay the holders of shares of
Series B Preferred Stock and Series A Preferred Stock the full amount to which they shall be
entitled, the holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock and Series A Preferred Stock shall
share ratably in any distribution of the remaining assets and funds of the Corporation in
proportion to the respective amounts which would otherwise be payable in respect of the shares
held by them upon such distribution if all amounts payable on or with respect to such shares
were paid in full.

(i) In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution
or winding up of the Corporation or a Deemed Liquidation Event, after the payment of all
preferential amounts required to be paid pursuant to subsections 2(a) and 2(b), the remaining
assets and funds of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders shall be
distributed ratably among the holders of shares of Common Stock.

(ii) | Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection 2(c) and the
previous subsections 2(a) and 2(b), if the amount a holder of Preferred Stock would receive with
respect to such shares would be greater if such shares were converted to Common Stock

DMWEST #8191526 v7 4
immediately prior to such liquidation, dissolution, winding up or Deemed Liquidation Event, the
holder of such shares will be paid that higher amount in lieu of payments called for by
subsections 2(a), 2(b) and 2(c).

(iii) | The amount in the aggregate that the holders of Series C Preferred
Stock are entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2 for each share of Series C Preferred Stock
shall be referred to as the “Series C Liquidation Preference.” The amount in the aggregate that
the holders of Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2 for each
share of Series B Preferred Stock shall be referred to as the “Series B Liquidation Preference.”
The amount in the aggregate that the holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive
pursuant to this Section 2 for each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be referred to as the
“Series A Liquidation Preference.”

(d) Deemed Liquidation Events. Unless holders of a majority of the Series C
Preferred Stock elect otherwise by written notice sent to the Corporation, any (i) merger,
reorganization, consolidation or share transfer which results in the voting securities of the
Corporation outstanding immediately prior thereto representing immediately thereafter (either by
remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving or acquiring
entity) less than a majority of the combined voting power of the voting securities of the
Corporation or such surviving or acquiring entity outstanding immediately after such merger,
reorganization, consolidation or share transfer, (ii) disposition, transfer, sale or exclusive lease or
license of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation or (iii) issuance or transfer of
shares of capital stock of ihe Corporation, in a single transaction or series of related transactions,
representing at Jeast fifty percent (50%) of the voting power of the voting securities of the
Corporation, shall be deemed to be a liquidation of the Corporation (each a “Deemed Liquidation
Event”). A sale (or multiple related sales) of one or more Subsidiaries of the Corporation
(whether by way of merger, consolidation, reorganization or sale of all or substantially all of the
Subsidiaries’ assets or securities) which constitutes all or substantially all of the consolidated
assets of the Corporation shall be deemed a sale of substantially all of the assets of the
Corporation for purposes of this subsection 2(d). The Corporation shall promptly provide to the
holders of shares of Preferred Stock such information concerning the terms of a Deemed
Liquidation Event and the value of the assets of the Corporation as may reasonably be requested
by the holders of Preferred Stock. If applicable, the Corporation shall cause the agreement or
plan of merger or consolidation to provide for a rate at which the shares of capital stock of the
Corporation are converted into or exchanged for cash, new securities or other property which
gives effect to this Section 2(d).

(e) Effecting a Deemed Liquidation Event.

(i) The Corporation shall not have the power to effect a Deemed
Liquidation Event referred to in subsection 2(d)}(i) unless the agreement or plan of merger or
consolidation for such transaction (the “Merger Agreement”) provides that the consideration
payable to the stockholders of the Corporation shall be allocated among the holders of capital
stock of the Corporation in accordance with subsections 2(a), 2(b) and 2(c).

(ii) In the event of a Deemed Liquidation Event referred to in
subsection 2(d)(1i) or 2(d){iii), if the Corporation does not effect a dissolution of the Corporation

DMWEST #8191526 v7 5
under the DGCL within 5 days after such Deemed Liquidation Event, then (A) the Corporation
shall send a written notice to each holder of Preferred Stock no later than the 5” day after the
Deemed Liquidation Event advising such holders of their right (and the requirements to be met
to secure such right) pursuant to the terms of the following clause (B) to require the redemption
of such shares of Preferred Stock, and (B) unless the holders of a majority of the Series C
Preferred Stock otherwise agree in a written instrument delivered to the Corporation not later
than 10 days after such Deemed Liquidation Event, the Corporation shall use the consideration
received by the Corporation for such Deemed Liquidation Event (net of any retained liabilities
associated with the assets sold or technology licensed, as determined in good faith by the Board
of Directors of the Corporation), together with any other assets of the Corporation available for
distribution to its stockholders (the “Available Proceeds”), to the extent legally available
therefor, on the 15" day after such Deemed Liquidation Event, to redeem all outstanding shares
of Series C Preferred Stock at a price per share equal to the Series C Liquidation Preference, and
once the Series C Preferred Stock has been fully redeemed, all outstanding shares of Series B
Preferred Stock at a price per share equal to the Series B Liquidation Preference and the Series A
Preferred Stock at a price per share equal to the Series A Liquidation Preference, on a pro rata
basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a redemption pursuant to the preceding
sentence, (Y) if the Available Proceeds are not sufficient to redeem all outstanding shares of
Series C Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall redeem a pro rata portion of each holder’s shares
of Series C Preferred Stock to the fullest extent of such Available Proceeds, based on the
respective amounts which would otherwise be payable in respect of the shares to be redeemed if
the Available Proceeds were sufficient to redeem all such shares, and shall redeem the remaining
shares to have been redeemed as soon as practicable after the Corporation has funds legally
available therefor and (Z) after redemption in full of the Series C Preferred Stock, if the
Available Proceeds are not sufficient to redeem all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred
Stock and Series A Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall redeem a pro rata portion of each
holder’s shares of Series B Preferred Stock and Series A Preferred Stock to the fullest extent of
such Available Proceeds, based on the respective amounts which would otherwise be payable in
respect of the shares to be redeemed if the Available Proceeds were sufficient to redeem all such
shares, and shall redeem the remaining shares to have been redeemed as soon as practicable after
the Corporation has funds legally available therefor. The provisions of Section 8 shall apply,
with such necessary changes in the details thereof as are necessitated by the context, to the
redemption of the Preferred Stock pursuant to this subsection 2(e)(ii). Prior to the distribution or
redemption provided for in this subsection 2(e)(ii), the Corporation shall not expend or dissipate
the consideration received for such Deemed Liquidation Event, except to discharge expenses
incurred in connection with such Deemed Liquidation Event.

(f) The Amount Deemed Paid or Distributed. The amount deemed paid or
distributed to the holders of Preferred Stock upon any liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up
(including any Deemed Liquidation Event) shall be the cash or the value of the property, rights
or securities paid or distributed to such holders by the Corporation or the acquiring person, firm
or other entity. If the amount distributed to the holders of Preferred Stock upon any liquidation,
dissolution, or winding-up (including any Deemed Liquidation Event) is made in property other
than cash, the fair market value of such property, rights, or securities distributed to such holders
shall be mutually agreed by the Board of Directors of the Corporation and holders of a majority
of the Series C Preferred Stock; provided, however, that if such mutual agreement cannot be

DMWEST #8191526 v7 6
reached, such fair market value shall be determined by following the procedures set forth in the
definition of Appraisal Procedure.

3, Voting.

(a) General. Each holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to the number of
votes equal to the number of whole shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Preferred
Stock held by such holder are convertible (as adjusted from time to time pursuant to subsection 4
hereof) as of the record date, at each meeting of stockholders of the Corporation (and written
actions of stockholders in lieu of meetings) with respect to any and all matters presented to the
stockholders of the Corporation for their action or consideration. Holders of Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to notice of any meeting of stockholders and, except as otherwise provided
herein or otherwise required by law, to vote together with the Common Stockholders as a single
class (on an as-converted basis).

(b) Series C Preferred Stock Directors. The holders of record of the shares of
Series C Preferred Stock shall have the right, voting at a meeting of stockholders called for the
purpose or by written consent, separately from the Common Stock and all other series of
Preferred Stock,

Preferred Stock own at least twenty percent (20%) of the Fully Diluted Equity (as defined
below), to elect two (2) individuals (the “Series C Directors”) to serve on the Board of Directors
of the Corporation.

(ii) for so long as the holders of record of the shares of Series C

Corporation.

(iii) | So long as the holders of record of the shares of Series C Preferred
Stock shall have the right to elect a director pursuant to this subsection 3(b), any member of the
Board of Directors elected pursuant to this subsection 3(b) may be removed at any time with or
without cause by, and only by, the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the then
outstanding Series C Preferred Stock. Any vacancy on the Board of Directors created by the
resignation, removal, incapacity or death of any director elected pursuant to this subsection 3(b)
shall only be filled by the holders of a majority of the Series C Preferred Stock or another
individual elected pursuant to this subsection 3(b).

(c) Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock Directors. For so

Preferred Stock remain outstanding (subject to adjustment for a stock dividend, stock split,
combination of shares, reclassification or other similar event with respect to the Series A
Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock), the holders of record of the shares of Series A

Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock shall have the right, voting together as a single

class, at a meeting of stockholders called for the purpose or by written consent, separately from
the Common Stock and all other series of Preferred Stock, to elect two (2) individuals (the

DMWEST 48191526 v7 7
“Series A/B Directors”) to serve on the Board of Directors of the Corporation. So long as the
holders of record of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock shall
have the right to elect a director pursuant to this subsection 3(c), any member of the Board of
Directors elected pursuant to this subsection 3(c) may be removed at any time with or without
cause by, and only by, the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the then
outstanding Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, voting together as a single
class. Any vacancy on the Board of Directors created by the resignation, removal, incapacity or
death of any director elected pursuant to this subsection 3(c) shall only be filled by the holders of
. amajority of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, voting together as a
single class, or another individual elected pursuant to this subsection 3(c).

by written consent, separately from the Preferred Stock, to elect one (1) individual to serve on
the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

(ec) Remaining Directors, All other directors of the Corporation shall be
elected by the holders of the Common Stock and Preferred Stock voting together as a single class
on an as-converted basis, with the holders of Preferred Stock to have that number of votes as is
determined in accordance with subsection 3(a).

4, Optional Conversion. The holders of Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights
as follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at
the option of the holder thereof, at any time and from time to time, and without the payment of
additional consideration by the holder thereof, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable
shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the applicable Original Purchase Price (as
defined below) by the applicable Conversion Price (as defined below) in effect at the time of
conversion. The “Conversion Price” for (i) the Series C Preferred Stock shall initially be equal
to the Series C Original Purchase Price; (ii) the Series B Preferred Stock shall initially be equal
to the Series B Original Purchase Price and (ili) the Series A Preferred Stock shall initially be
equal to the Series A Original Purchase Price. Such Conversion Price, and the rate at which
shares of Preferred Stock may be converted into shares of Common Stock, shall be subject to
adjustment as provided below. In the event of a Deemed Liquidation Event, the Conversion
Rights shall terminate at the close of business on the last full day preceding the date fixed for the
payment of any such amounts distributable on such event to the holders of Preferred Stock.

{b) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued
upon conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would
otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to the product of such fraction
multiplied by the fair market value of a share of Common Stock, as mutually agreed by the
Board of Directors of the Corporation and holders of a majority of the Series C Preferred Stock;
provided, however, that if such mutual agreement cannot be reached, such fair market value shall
be determined by following the procedures set forth in the definition of Appraisal Procedure.
The determination of fractional shares shall be based on the aggregate number of shares of

DMWEST #8191526 v7 8
Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion by any holder of Preferred Stock and not on the
individual shares of Preferred Stock held by such holder.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion.

(i) Notice of Conversion. In order for a holder of Preferred Stock to
convert shares of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the
certificate or certificates for such shares of Preferred Stock, at the office of the transfer agent for
the Preferred Stock (or at the principal office of the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its
own transfer agent), together with written notice that such holder elects to convert all or any
number of the shares of the Preferred Stock represented by such certificate or certificates. Such
notice shall state such holder’s name or the names of the nominees in which such holder wishes
the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued. If required by the
Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by a
written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly
executed by the registered holder or his or its attorney duly authorized in writing. The date of
receipt of such certificates and notice by the transfer agent (or by the Corporation if the
Corporation serves as its own transfer agent) shall be the conversion date (“Conversion Date”).
The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after the Conversion Date, issue and deliver at such
office to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to his or its nominees, a certificate or certificates for
the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled, together with cash
in lieu of any fraction of a share. On the Conversion Date, each holder of record of shares of
Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such Preferred Stock, notwithstanding that the
certificates evidencing such shares of Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered to such
holder.

(ii) | Reservation of Shares. The Corporation shall at all times when
Preferred Stock shall be outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but
unissued stock, for the purpose of effecting the conversion of Preferred Stock, such number of its
duly authorized shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but
unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then
outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall take such corporate action as
may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such
number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging
in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to the
Certificate of Incorporation. Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment
reducing the Conversion Price below the then par value of the shares of Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take any corporate action which
may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Corporation may validly and
legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion
Price.

(iii) Effect of Conversion. All shares of Preferred Stock which shall
have been surrendered for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be
outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares, including the rights, if any, to receive

DMWEST #8191526 v7 9
notices and to vote, shall immediately cease and terminate on the Conversion Date, except only
the right of the holders thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor and
payment of any dividends declared but unpaid thereon. Any shares of Preferred Stock so
converted shail be retired and cancelled and shall not be reissued, and the Corporation (without -
the need for stockholder action) may thereafter take such appropriate action as may be necessary
to reduce the authorized number of shares of Preferred Stock accordingly.

(iv) Taxes. The Corporation shall pay any and all issue, transfer, stamp
and other taxes that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of Common
Stock upon conversion of shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4. The Corporation
shall not, however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer
involved in the issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in
which the shares of Preferred Stock so converted were registered, and no such issuance or
delivery shall be made unless and until the person or entity requesting such issuance has paid to
the Corporation the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the
Corporation, that such tax has been paid.

(d) Adjustments to Conversion Price for Diluting Issues:

(i) No Adjustment of Conversion Price. No adjustment pursuant to
subsection 4(d)(iii) in the Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock shall be made (a) unless the
consideration per share (determined pursuant to subsection 4(d)(iv) below) for Additional Shares
of Common Stock (as defined below) issued or deemed to be issued by the Corporation is less
than the applicable Conversion Price in effect on the date of, and immediately prior to, the issue
of such Additional Shares, for such series of Preferred Stock or (b) if prior to or within sixty (60)
days subsequent to such issuance, the Corporation receives written notice from the holders ofa
majority of the outstanding Series C Preferred Stock, agreeing that no such adjustment shall be
made as the result of the issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock.

fii) — Issue of Securities Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common

Stock. If the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall
issue any Options or Convertible Securities (as such terms are defined below) or shall fix a
record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive any such
Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set
forth in the instrument relating thereto, assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to
exercisability, convertibility or exchangeability, but without regard to any provision contained
therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options
or, in the case of Convertible Securitics and Options therefor, the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to be Additional Shares of Common Stock issued as of

the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of
business on such record date, provided that Additional Shares of Common Stock shall not be
deemed to have been issued unless the consideration per share (determined pursuant to
subsection 4(d)(iv) below) of such Additional Shares of Common Stock would be less than the
applicable Conversion Price in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such issue, or such
record date, as the case may be, and provided further that in any such case in which Additional
Shares of Common Stock are deemed to be issued:

DMWEST #8191526 v7 10
(A) No further adjustment in the Conversion Price shall be
made upon the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities or shares of Common Stock upon the
exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities;

(B) If such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms
provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any increase or decrease in the consideration
payable to the Corporation, upon the exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, the Conversion
Price computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with
respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon any such increase or
decrease becoming effective, be recomputed to reflect such increase or decrease insofar as it
affects such Options or the rights of conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities;

(C) Upon the expiration of any such Options or any rights of
conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have been exercised,
the Conversion Price computed upon the origina] issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a
record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon

‘ such expiration, be recomputed as if:

(1) In the case of Convertible Securities or Options for
Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common Stock issued were the
shares of Common Stock, if any, actually issued upon the exercise of such
Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities and the
consideration received therefor was the consideration actually received by the
Corporation for the issue of all such Options, whether or not exercised, plus the
consideration actually received by the Corporation upon such exercise, or for the
issue of all such Convertible Securities which were actually converted or
exchanged, plus the additional consideration, if any, actually received by the
Corporation upon such conversion or exchange; and

(2) in the case of Options for Convertible Securities,
only the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof
were issued at the time of issue of such Options, and the consideration recerved
by the Corporation for the Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have
been then issued was the consideration actually received by the Corporation for
the issue of all such Options, whether or not exercised, plus the consideration
deemed to have been received by the Corporation (determined pursuant to
subsection 4(d){iv) below) upon the issue of the Convertible Securities with
respect to which such Options were actually exercised;

(D) _ In the event of any change in the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any Option or Convertible
Security, including, but not limited to, a change resulting from the anti-dilution provisions
thereof, the Conversion Price then in effect shall forthwith be readjusted to such Conversion
Price as would have been obtained had the adjustment which was made upon the issuance of
such Option or Convertible Security not exercised or converted prior to such change been made
upon the basis of such change; and

DMWEST #8191526 v7 . 11
(E) No readjustment pursuant to clause (B), (C) or (D) above
shall have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price to an amount which exceeds the lower of
(i) the Conversion Price on the original adjustment date, or (11) the Conversion Price that would
have resulted from any issuances of Additional Shares of Common Stock between the original
adjustment date and such readjustment date.

(F) Inthe event the Corporation, after the Original Issue Date,
amends any Options or Convertible Securities (whether such Options or Convertible Securities
were outstanding on the Original Issue Date or were issued after the Original Issue Date) to
increase the number of shares issuable thereunder or decrease the consideration to be paid upon
exercise or conversion thereof, then such Options or Convertible Securities, as so amended, shall
be deemed to have been issued after the Original Issue Date and the provisions of this
subsection 4(d)(ii) shall apply.

(G) Upon the expiration or termination of any unexercised
Option or unconverted or unexchanged Convertible Security (or portion thereof) which resulted
(either upon its original issuance or upon a revision of its terms) in an adjustment to the
Conversion Price pursuant to the terms of subsection 4(d)(iii), the Conversion Price shall be
readjusted to such Conversion Price as would have obtained had such Option or Convertible
Security (or portion thereof) never been issued.

(iit) Adjustment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional
Shares of Common Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Original Issue

Date issue Additional Shares of Common Stock (including Additional Shares of Common Stock
deemed to be issued pursuant to subsection 4(d)(ii) above, but excluding shares issued as a stock
split or combination as provided in subsection 4(e) below or upon a dividend or distribution as
provided in Subsection 4(f) below), without consideration or for a consideration per share less
than the applicable Conversion Price in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such issue,
then and in such event, such Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to
a price determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, (A) the numerator of
which shall be (1) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such
issue (on an As-Converted Basis (as defined below)) plus (2) the number of shares of Common
Stock which the aggregate consideration received or to be received by the Corporation for the
total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued would purchase at such
Conversion Price; and (B) the denominator of which shall be (1) the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue (on an As-Converted Basis) plus

(2) the number of such Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued and/or deemed to be
issued.

a

(iv) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this
Subsection 4(d), the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional
Shares of Common Stock shall be computed as follows:

DMWEST #8191526 v7 12
(A) | Cash and Property: Such consideration shall:

(1) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
aggregate of cash received by the Corporation, excluding amounts paid or payable
for accrued interest;

(2) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair market value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined
in good faith by the Board of Directors, or if requested by the holders of a
majority of the outstanding Series C Preferred Stock, by agreement of the Board,
of Directors and the holders of a majority of the outstanding Series C Preferred
Stock, and if the Board of Directors and the holders of a majority of the
outstanding Series C Preferred Stock do not agree on such fair market value, in
accordance with the procedures set forth in the definition of Appraisal Procedure;
and

(3) in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock
are issued together with other shares or securities or other assets of the
Corporation for consideration which covers both, be the proportion of such
consideration so received, computed as provided in clauses (1) and (2) above, as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(B) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per
‘share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been
issued pursuant to Subsection 4(d)(ii) above, relating to Options and Convertible Securities, shall
be determined by dividing:

(x) the total amount, if any, received by the Corporation
as consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities,
plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set
forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision
contained therein for a potential subsequent adjustment of such
consideration) payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such
Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, or
in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such
Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities, by

(y) | the maximum number of shares of Common Stock
(as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any
provision contained therein for a potential subsequent adjustment of such
number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities.

(e) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If the Corporation shall at

any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date effect a subdivision of the outstanding
Common Stock, the applicable Conversion Price then in effect immediately before that

DMWEST #8191526 v7 13
subdivision shall be proportionately decreased so that the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be increased in proportion to such
increase in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. If the Corporation
shall at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date combine the outstanding
shares of Common Stock, the applicable Conversion Price then in effect immediately before the
combination shall be proportionately increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be decreased in proportion to such
decrease in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. Any adjustment
under this paragraph shall become effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or
combination becomes effective.

(f) Adjustment for Certain Dividends and Distributions. In the event the
Corporation at any time, or from time to time, after the Original Issue Date shall make or issue,

or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a
dividend or other distribution payable on the Common Stock solely in additional shares of
Common Stock, then and in each such event the Conversion Price for each-series of Preferred
Stock in effect immediately before such event shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance
or, in the event such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such
record date, by multiplying the Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock then in effect
by a fraction:

(i) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the
close of business on such record date, and

(ii) | the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the
close of business on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in
payment of such dividend or distribution;

provided, however, (a) if such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend is not fully
paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the Conversion Price for
each series of Preferred Stock shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on
such record date and thereafter the Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock shall be
adjusted pursuant to this paragraph as of the time of actual payment of such dividends or
distributions; (b) that no such adjustment shall be made if the holders of Preferred Stock
simultaneously receive a dividend or other distribution of shares of Common Stock in a number
equal to the number of shares of Common Stock as they would have received if all outstanding
shares of such Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event.

(g) Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange or Substitution. If the
Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be changed into the

same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by capital
reorganization, reclassification, or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares
or stock dividend provided for above, or a reorganization, merger, consolidation, or sale of assets
provided for below), then and in each such event the holder of each such share of Preferred Stock
shall have the right thereafter to convert such share into the kind and amount of shares of stock

DMWEST #8191526 v7 14
and other securities and property receivable, upon such reorganization, reclassification, or other
change, by holders of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of
Preferred Stock might have been converted immediately prior to such reorganization,
reclassification, or change, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein.

(h) Adjustment for Merger or Reorganization, etc. In case of any
consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into another corporation or the sale of all or

substantially all of the assets of the Corporation to another corporation, each share of Preferred
Stock, if any, remaining outstanding after such consolidation, merger or sale shall thereafter be
convertible (or shall be converted into a security which shall be convertible) into the kind and
amount of shares of stock or other securities or cash or other property to which a holder of the
number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation deliverable upon conversion of such
Preferred Stock would have been entitled upon such consolidation, merger or sale; and, in such
case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions in this Section 4
set forth with respect to the rights and interest thereafter of the holders of the Preferred Stock, to
the end that the provisions set forth in this Section 4 (including provisions with respect to
changes in and other adjustments of the Conversion Price) shall thereafter be applicable, as
nearly equivalent a manner as may be practicable as before the consolidation or merger. If any
event occurs of the type contemplated by the provisions of this Section 4 but not expressly
provided for by such provisions (including, without limitation, the granting of stock appreciation
rights, phantom stock rights or other rights with equity features), then the Board of Directors of
‘the Corporation shall make an appropriate reduction in the Conversion Price so as to protect the
rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock.

(i) Certificate as to Adjustments.. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation at its expense
shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable but in any event not later than 10 days thereafter,
compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to
each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment
(including the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property into which the Preferred
Stock is convertible) and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment
is based. The Corporation shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable but in any event not later
than 10 days thereafter, upon the written request at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock,
furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a similar certificate setting forth (i) such
adjustments and readjustments, (ii) the Conversion Price then in effect, and (iii) the number of
shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of cash or other property which then would be
received upon the conversion of such Preferred Stock. ,

Gj) Notice of Record Date. In the event:

(i) that the Corporation declares a dividend (or any other distribution)
on its Common Stock payable in Common Stock or other securities of the Corporation;

(ii) that the Corporation subdivides or combines its outstanding shares
of Common Stock;

DMWEST #8191526 v7 15
(iii) of any reclassification of the Common Stock of the Corporation
(other than a subdivision or combination of its outstanding shares of Common Stock or a stock
dividend or stock distribution thereon), or of any consolidation or merger of the Corporation into
or with another corporation, or of the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Corporation; or ,

(iv) of the involuntary or voluntary dissolution, liquidation or winding
up of the Corporation;

then, and in each such case, the Corporation shall cause to be filed at its principal office or at the
office of the transfer agent of the Preferred Stock, and shall cause to be mailed to the holders of
Preferred Stock at their last addresses as shown on the records of the Corporation or such transfer
agent, at least ten days prior to the date specified in (A) below or twenty days before the date
specified in (B) below, a notice stating the amount per share and character of such exchange
applicable to the Preferred Stock and the Common Stock and specifying, as the case may be,
either (A) the record date of such dividend, distribution, subdivision or combination, or, ifa
record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of Common Stock of record to be
entitled to such dividend, distribution, subdivision or combination are to be determined, or

(B) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, dissolution, liquidation
or winding up is expected to become effective, and the date as of which it is expected that
holders of Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their sharcs of Common Stock
for securities or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger,
sale, dissolution or winding up.

5. Mandatory Conversion.

(a) Trigger Events. Upon (i) the vote of the Required Holders (as defined
below), or (ii) the closing of a Qualified Public Offering (as defined below) (the earlier of clause
(i) or Gi) the “Mandatory Conversion Date”), all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be
automatically converted into shares of Common Stock into which such Preferred Stock is
convertible pursuant to Section 4 above and such shares of Preferred Stock may not be reissued
by the Corporation.

(b) Procedural Requirements. Al! holders of record of shares of Preferred
Stock shall be given written notice of the Mandatory Conversion Date and the place designated
for mandatory conversion of all such shares of Preferred Stock, pursuant to this Section 5. Such
notice shall be sent to each record holder of Preferred Stock at such holder’s address last shown
on the records of the transfer agent for the Preferred Stock (or the records of the Corporation, if it
serves as its own transfer agent). Upon receipt of such notice, each holder of shares of Preferred
Stock shall surrender his, her or its certificate or certificates for all such shares (or, if such holder
alleges that such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and
agreement reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against any
claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or
destruction of such certificate) to the Corporation at the place designated in such notice. On the
Mandatory Conversion Date, all rights with respect to the Preferred Stock so converted,
including the rights, if any, to receive notices and vote (other than as a holder of Common Stock)
will terminate, except only the rights of the holders thereof, upon surrender of their certificate or

DMWEST #8191526 v7 16
certificates therefor, to receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which
such Preferred Stock has been converted, and payment of any accrued and/or declared but unpaid
dividends thereon. If so required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion
shall be endorsed or accompanied by written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form
satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or by his or its attorney
duly authorized in writing. As soon as practicable after the Mandatory Conversion Date and the
surrender of the certificate or certificates for Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall cause to be
issued and delivered to such holder, or on his, her or its written order, a certificate or certificates
for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable on such conversion in accordance with
the provisions hereof, together with cash as provided in subsection 4(b) above in lieu of any
fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion and payment of
any declared but unpaid dividends on the shares of Preferred Stock so converted. On the
Mandatory Conversion Date, each holder of record or shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed
to be the holder of record of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such Preferred
Stock, notwithstanding that the certificates representing such shares of Preferred Stock shall not
have been surrendered at the office of the Corporation, that notice from the Corporation shal] not
have been received by any holder of record of shares of such Preferred Stock, or that the
certificates evidencing such shares of Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered to such
holder.

(c}) All certificates evidencing shares of Preferred Stock which are required to
be surrendered for conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof shall, from and after the
Mandatory Conversion Date, be deemed to have been retired and cancelled and the shares of
Preferred Stock represented thereby converted into Common Stock for all purposes,
notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender such certificates on or
prior to such date. The Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate action (without the
need for stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized Preferred Stock
accordingly.

6. Protective Covenants.

8. Redemption.

(a) The Corporation will, subject to the conditions set forth below, at any time
on or after the seventh (7th) anniversary of the Original Issuance Date, upon reccipt at any time
of a written request for redemption (a “Redemption Request”) from holders of (i) at least a
majority of the Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class on an as-converted basis, and
(ii) at least a majority of the Series C Preferred Stock, voting separately as a single class on an
as-converted basis, redeem in full for cash the number of shares of Preferred Stock held by each
such electing holder in three (3) annual installments commencing on the date designated in such
Redemption Request, to be no sooner than sixty (60) days following the delivery of such
Redemption Request (the date designated in the Redemption Request and each anniversary
thereof, a “Mandatory Redemption Date”). Each holder of Preferred Stock may elect to
withdraw a Redemption Request with respect to all or a portion of such holder’s shares of
Preferred Stock to be redeemed on a Mandatory Redemption Date by giving the Corporation
written notice of such holder’s decision to withdraw from such redemption at least fifteen (15)
days prior to the applicable Mandatory Redemption Date.

(b) — Each share of Preferred Stock to be redeemed on a Mandatory
Redemption Date shall be redeemed at a price per share of Preferred Stock for each series of
Preferred Stock (each a “Mandatory Redemption Price”) equal to the applicable Original
Purchase Price plus an amount equal to all accrued and/or declared and unpaid dividends on the
Preferred Stock. The Corporation shall redeem one-third of the outstanding shares of Preferred
Stock to be redeemed on the Mandatory Redemption Date set forth in the Redemption Request,
one-half of the remaining outstanding shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed on the first
anniversary thereof and all of the remaining shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed on the
second anniversary thereof.

(c) The Corporation shall provide written notice of the Redemption Request,
specifying (i) the time and place of such redemption, (ii) the number of shares of each series of
Preferred Stock held by the holder that the Corporation shall redeem on the Mandatory
Redemption Date, (iii) that the holder is to surrender to the Corporation, in the manner and at the
place designated, his, her or its certificate or certificates representing the shares of Preferred
Stock to be redeemed and (iv) the applicable Mandatory Redemption Price (the “Mandatory
Redemption Price”), by first class or registered mail, postage prepaid, to each holder of record of
Preferred Stock at the address for such holder last shown on the records of the transfer agent
therefor (or the records of the Corporation, if it serves as its own transfer agent), prior to each
Mandatory Redemption Date. The Corporation shall use its best efforts and shall take al]
reasonable action necessary to pay the Mandatory Redemption Price as provided in this Section
8, including obtaining financing or effectuating a recapitalization so as to create a surplus.

(d) Insufficient Funds. If the funds of the Corporation legally available for
redemption of the Preferred Stock on any Mandatory Redemption Date are insufficient to redeem
the full number of shares of the Preferred Stock required under this Section 8 to be redeemed on
such date, those funds which are legally available will be used to redeem the maximum possible
number of shares of the Preferred Stock being redeemed, such redemption to be made pro rata
among the holders of the Preferred Stock in accordance with the number of shares of Preferred
Stock held by such holders. At any time thereafter when additional funds of the Corporation

DMWEST #8191526 v7 30
become legally available for the redemption of the Preferred Stock, such funds will be used to
redeem the balance of the shares of Preferred Stock which the Corporation was theretofore
obligated to redeem as provided in the immediately preceding sentence. Any shares of Preferred
Stock which are not redeemed as a result of the circumstances described in this subsection 8(d)
shall remain outstanding and entitled to ail rights and preferences provided herein until such
shares shall have been redeemed and the Mandatory Redemption Price therefor, as applicable,
shall have been paid or set aside for payment in full. In the event that less than all of the shares
of Preferred Stock represented by a certificate are redeemed, a new certificate representing the
unredeemed shares of the applicable Preferred Stock shall promptly be issued to such holder
upon such holder’s request.

(e) Rights Terminated. Upon (i) presentation and surrender of the certificate
or certificates representing the shares of Preferred Stock being redeemed on a Mandatory
Redemption Date pursuant to this Section 8 and receipt of the Mandatory Redemption Price for
such shares of Preferred Stock, or (ii) irrevocable deposit in trust by the Corporation for the
holders of the Preferred Stock being redeemed on a Mandatory Redemption Date pursuant to this
Section 8 of an amount equal to the Mandatory Redemption Price for the shares of Preferred
Stock being redeemed on such Mandatory Redemption Date, each holder of Preferred Stock will
cease to have any rights as a stockholder of the Corporation by reason of the ownership of such
redeemed shares of Preferred Stock (except for the right to receive the Mandatory Redemption
Price therefor upon the surrender of the certificate or certificates representing the redeemed
shares if such certificate or certificates have not been surrendered), and such redeemed shares of
Preferred Stock will not from and after the date of payment in full of the Mandatory Redemption
Price therefor be deemed to be outstanding.

(f) Restrictions on Other Payments. After the receipt by the Corporation of a
Redemption Request, unless and until the full Mandatory Redemption Price for the shares of
Preferred Stock to be redeemed on any Mandatory Redemption Date has been paid to the holders
requesting such redemption, (i) no dividends shall be paid or declared or set aside for payment or
other distribution upon any capital stock of the Corporation (other than solely in shares of
Common Stock for which adjustment may be made pursuant to Section 4 above), and (ii) no
shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be redeemed, retired, purchased or otherwise
acquired for any consideration (or any payment made to or available for a sinking fund for the
redemption of any such shares) by the Corporation or any Subsidiary (except (y) by conversion
into or exchange for shares of Common Stock for which adjustment may be made pursuant to
Section 4 above or (z) repurchases of Common Stock of the Corporation from current or former
employees or service providers at a price no greater than the original purchase price for such
shares, provided that such repurchase pursuant to clause (z) has been approved by the holders of
a majority of the Series C Preferred Stock).

(g)  Reacquired Shares. Any shares of Preferred Stock converted, redeemed,
purchased, or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever shall be retired
and canceled promptly after the acquisition thereof, and shall not be reissued and the Corporation
from time to time shall take such action as may be necessary to reduce the authorized Preferred
Stock accordingly. :
