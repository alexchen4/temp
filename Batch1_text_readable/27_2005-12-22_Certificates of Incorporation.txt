(e) Deemed Conversion. For purposes of dete: nining the amount each holder of shares
of Preferred Stock is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 3, each holder of shares of Preferzed Stock

Stock into Common Stock) such holder’s shares of Preferred Stock into Common Stock immediately prior
to a distribution pursuant to this Section 3 if, as a result of an actua! conversion, such holder would receive,
in the aggregate, an amount greater than the amount that would be distributed to such holder if such holder
did not convert such shares of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock. If any such holder shall be
deemed to have converted shares of Preferred Stock into Common Stock pursuant to this paragraph, then
such holder shal! not be entitled to receive any distribution that would otherwise be made to hoiders of
Preferred Stock that have not converted (or have not been deemed to have converted) into shares of
Common Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a Liquidation Event includes an earn-out,
escrow arrangement or other contingent payment not delivered to the Company’s stockholders at the initial

4. Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as follows (the
“Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Subject to Section 4(b), each share of the Series A Preferred
Stock shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such
share at the office of the Company or any transfer agent for the Series A Preferred Stock, into that number of
fully-paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock that is equal to the Original Issue Erice of the Series
A Preferred Stock divided by the Series A Conversion Price. The initial conversion price per share of Series
A Preferred Stock (the “Series A Conversion Price”) shall be the Original Issue Price of the Series A
Preferred Stock and shall be subject to adjustment as provided herein. The number of shares of Common
Stock into which each share of Series A Preferred Stock may be converted is hereinafter referred to as the
“Series A Converzion Rate.” Upon any decrease or increase in the Series A Conversion Price for a share of
Series A Preferred Stock, as described in this Section 4, the corresponding Series A Conversion Rate for
such share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be appropriately increased or decreased.

Subject to Section 4(b), each share of the Series B Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option
of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share at the office of the Company or any
transfer agent for the Series B Preferred Stock, into that number of fully-paid and nonassessable shares of
Common Stock that is equal to the Original Issue Price of the Series B Preferred Stock divided by the Series
B Conversion Price. The initial conversion price per share of Series B Preferred Stock (the “Series B
Conversion Price’) shall be the Original Issue Price of the Series B Preferred Stock and shall be subject to
adjustment as provided herein. The number of shares of Common Stock into which each share of Series B

IVR - Amended aad Restated Articles (Series B) (2). DOC -5-
Preferred Stock may be converted is hereinafter referred to as the “Series B Conversion Rate.” Upon any
decrease or increase in the Series B Conversion Price for a share of Series B Preferred Stock, as described in
this Section 4, the corresponding Series B Conversion Rate for such share of Series B Preferred Stock shall
be appropriately increased or decreased.

The ‘Series A Conversion Price” and the ‘Series B Conversion Price” are hereinafler at times
together referred to as the “Conversion Price.” The “Series A Conversion Rate” and the “Series B
Conversion Rate” are at times together referred to as the “Conversion Rate.”

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shal! automatically be
converted into fully paid, non-assessable shares of Common Stock at the then effective Convers:on Rate for
such share immediately upon the earlier of (i) the consummation of an underwritten public offering of
Common Stock registered under the Securities Act of 1953, as amended, at a price per share (prior to
underwriting commissions and offering expenses) which reflects a valuation of the Company (before receipt
of any proceeds from the public offering) of at least $100 million and with aggregate net proceeds to the
Company of at least $40 million (a “Qualified Public Offering”) or (ii) the receipt by the Company of a
written request for such conversion from the holders of at least seventy percent (70%) of the then-
outstanding Preferred Stock voting together as a single class. In the event of the automatic conversion of the
Preferred Stock in connection with a Qualified Public Offering or by written request, the person(s) entitled
to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of the Preferred Stocl. shall be deemed to have
converted such Preferred Stock immediately prior to the closing of such sale and issuance of securities or the
effectiveness of such written request, as the case may be.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued
upon conversion of the Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would otherwise
be entitled upon conversion of the Preferred Stock by such holder (after all fractional shares arising from
such holder’s conversion have been aggregated into the greatest possible number of whole shares), the
Company shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the then fair market value of such fractional
shares as determined by the Board of Directors of the C:moany. Before any holder of the Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to convert the same into full shares of ‘*ommon Stock, and to receive certificates therefor,
they shall either (i) surrender the certificate or certiiic.ies therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the
Company or of any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock or (ii) notify the Company or its transfer agent that
such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and execute an agreement satisfactory to the Company
to indemnify the Cu..pany from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates, and shall give
written notice to the Company at such office that they elect to convert the same; provided, however, that in
the event of an automatic conversion pursuant to Section 4(b) above, the outstanding shares of the Preferzed
Stock shall be converted automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether
or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Company or its transfer ayent,
provided further, that the Company shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such automatic conversion unicss either the certificates evidencing such
shares of the Preferred Stock are delivered to the Company or its transfer agent a8 provided above, or the
holder notifies the Company or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed
and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Company to indemnify the Company from any loss incurred
by it in connection with such certificates.

The Company shall, as soon as practicable after such delivery, or afer receipt of such agreement
and indemnification, if any, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of the Preferred Stock, a
certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which the holder shall be entitled as
aforesaid and a check payable to the holder in the amount of any cash amounts payable as the result of a
conversion into fractional shares of Common Stock, plus any declared and unpaid dividends on the
converted Preferred Stock. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the

3VR - Amended aud Restated Articles (Serice B) (2). DOC --
close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of the Preferred Stock to be converted, and the
person or persons entitled to reve:ve the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be
treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date;
provided, however, that if the conversion is in connection with a public offering or a Liquidation Event, the
conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering the Preferred Stock for conversion, be coaditioned
upon the closing of the sale of securities pursuant to such public offering, c: such Liquidation Event, in
which event the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of the
Preferred Stock shal! not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the
closing or consummation of the public offering or Liquidation Event.

Date, any Additional Stock (as defined below) without consideration or for a consideration per share less
than the Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Addit: onal Stock, the
Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall automatically (except as
otherwise provided in this Section 4(d)(i)) be adjusted to a price determined by multiplying the Series A
Conversion Price by a fraction, (x) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such issuance (the “Outstanding Common”) plus the number of shares of
Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received by the Company for such issuance would purchase
at the Series A Conversion Price; and (y) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of
Outstanding Common plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock. For purposes of this Section
4(d)()(A), the term “‘Qutstanding Common” shall include all shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock.

Price by a fraction, (x) the numerator of which shall be the Outstandirg Coinmon plus the number of shares
of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received by the Company for such issuance would
purchase at the Series B Conversion Price; and (y) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares
of Outstanding Common plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock.

(B) No adjustment of the applicable Conversion Price shall be made if
the amcunt of such reduction would be Icas than $0.01. Except to the limited extent provided for in Sections
4(d)(i}E)(3) and 4(d)(i)(E)(4), no adjustment of such Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4(d)(i) shall
have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price above the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to
such adjustment.

(C) Im the case of the issuance of Additional Stock for cash, the
consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting any reasonable
discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the Company for any underwriting or
otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

(D) In the case of the issuance of the Additional Stock for a
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be deemed to be the
