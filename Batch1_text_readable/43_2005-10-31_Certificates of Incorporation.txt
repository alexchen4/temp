thereof, at any time after the issuance of such shure, into fully paid and nouasscssable shares of
Common Stock of the Corporation into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Common Stock as is obtained by (i) multiplying the number of shares of the Preferred Stock to
be so converted by the applicable Original Price for such shares of Preferred Stock and
(ii) dividing the result by the applicable Conversion Price (hereinafter defined) for such senes of
Preferred Stock. Subject to adjustment as provided below, the “Series | Conversion Price” will
be the Series | Original Price.

(b) — The holder of any sharcs of Preferred Stock may exercise the conversion rights as
to such shares or any part thereof by delivering to the Corporation during regular business hours,
at the office of any transfer agent of the Corporation for the Preferred Stock. or at the principal
office of the Corporation or at such other place as may be designated by the Corporation, the
certificate or certificates for the shares to be converted, duly endorsed for transfer to the
Corporation or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer (if required by it),
accompanied by written notice stating that the holder elects to convert all or a number of such
shares represented by the certificate or certificatcs. Such notice will also state such holder’s
name or the names of the nominees in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for
shares of Common Stock to be issued. Conversion will be deemed to have been effected on the
date when such delivery is made, and such date is referred to herein as the “Conversion Date”.
As promptly as practicable thereafter the Corporation will issue and deliver to such holder, at
such office or other place designated by the Corporation, a certificate or certificates for the
number of full shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled and a check for cash
with respect to any fractional intcrest in a sharc of Common Stock as provided in Subsection

new certificate covering the number of shares of Preferred Stock representing the unconverted
portion of the certificate so surrendered.

issuable upon conversion thcreof will be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of

17211. 7-4 9GR3 v5 =
shares of Preferred Stock so surrendered. Instead of any fractional shares of Common Stock that
would otherwise be issuable upon conversion of any sharcs of Preferred Stock, the Corporation
will pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fractional interest equal to the fair market value of
such fractional interest as determined in good faith by the Corporation’s Board of Directors. The
Corporation will pay any and all issue and other taxes that may be payable in respect of any issue
or delivery of shares of Common Stock on conversion of Preferred Stock pursuant hereto. ‘The
Corporation will not, however, be required to pay any tax that may be payable in respect of any
transfer involved in the issue and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that
in which the Preferred Stock so converted was registered, and no such issue or delivery will be
made unless and until the person requesting such issue has paid tv Uie Corporation the arnount of.
any sucli tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax has been paid.

(d) | The Corporation will at all times reserve and keep available, out of its authorized
but unissued Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of Preferred
Stock, the full number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon the conversion of all
Preterred Stock from time to time outstanding. The Corporation will from time to time use its
best effort to obtain necessary director and stockholder approvals, in accordance with the laws of
the State of Delaware, to increase the authorized amount of its Common Stock if at any time the
authorized amount of its Common Stock remaining unissued will not be sufficient to permit the
conversion of all of the shares of Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, and will take all such
actions as are necessary to increase such authorized amount of Common Stock upon obtaining
such approvals.

(e) If the Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of Preferred Stock will be
changed into the same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by
capital reorganization, reclassification, or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of
shares or stock dividend provided for in Subscction 5(a)), then and in each such event the holder
of each share of Preferred Stock will have the night thereafter to convert such share into the kind
aid amount of shares of stock and other securities and property receivable upon such
reorganization, reclassification, or other change, by holders of the numher of shares of Common
Stock into which such shares of Preferred Stock might have been converted immediately prior to
such reorganization, reclassification, or change.

() In case of any consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into another
corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation to another
corporation (other than a consolidation, merger or sale treated as a Liquidating Event pursuant to
Subsection 2(c) above), each share of Preferred Stock will thereafier be convertible into the kind
and amount of shares of stock or other securities or property that a holder of the number of shares
of Common Stock of the Corporation deliverable upon conversion of Preferred Stock would have
been entitled upon such consolidation, merger or sale; and in such case, appropriate adjustment
(as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) will be made in the application of the
provisions of Sections 4 and 5 with respect to the rights and interest thereafter of the holders of
Preferred Stock, to the end that the provisions set forth in Sections 5 and 6 will thereafter be
applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any shares of stock or other property
thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of Preferred Stock.

17201. 7-419D88 v5
(z) If any shares of Common Stock to be reserved for the purpose of conversion of
shares of Preferred Stock require registration or listing with, or approval of, any governmental
authority, stock exchange or other regulatory body under any federal or state law or regulation or
otherwisc, before such shares may be validly issued or delivered upon conversion, the
Corporation will in good faith and as expeditiously as possible endeavor to secure such
registration, listing or approval, as the case may he.

(h) All shares of Common Stock that may be issued upon conversion of the shares of
Preferred Stock will upon issuance hy the Corporation be validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and free from all taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issuance thereof,

4. Adjustment of Conversion Price

The Conversion Price from time to time in effect will be subject to adjustment from time
to time as follows.

(a) Stock Splits, Dividends and Combinations. In case the Corporation will at any
time subdivide the outstanding shares of Common Stock or will issue a dividend in Common
Stock on its outstanding Common Stock, the Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock
in effect immediately prior to such subdivision or the issuance of such dividend will be
proportionately decreased, and in case the Corporation will at any time combine the outstanding
shares of Common Stock into a Jesser number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price
for each series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such combination will be

proportionately increased, concurrently with the effectiveness of such subdivision, dividend or
combination, as the case may be.

(b) Noncash Dividends, Stock Purchase Rights, Capital Recorganizations and
Dissolutions. In case:

(i) the Corporation will take a record of the holders of its Common Stock for
