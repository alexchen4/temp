Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock or Common Stock. The’

such consideration consists of a combination of forms of consideration (e.g., a combination of cash and
securities of a publicly traded entity), such consideration shall be paid to the maximum extent practicable
based on the relative proportions otherwise payable in respect of the Series D Preferred Stock). Any
consideration payable upon a Liquidation Event in a form other than cash shall be valued by the Board of
Directors (the “Board of Directors”) in accordance with Section 3(d) below.

(ii) Cumulative Dividend Adjustments. In the event the Series D IPO Value or
the Series D Liquidation Event Value, as the case may require, exceeds the Series D Return Cap, then the
cumulative dividend specified in Section 2(a)(i) above shall be reduced to the maximum amount required

solely as a result of the payment of the dividends payable pursuant to Section 2(a)(i), the Series D Return
Cap.

above, the holders of Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock, on a pari passu basis, shall be

Issue Price of the Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock, as the case may be, per share per
annum on each outstanding share of Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock prior and in
preference to payment of any dividend on the Series A Preferred Stock or Common Stock. Subject to: the
rights of holders of Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock, the holders of outstanding shares
of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive dividends payable out of funds legally available
therefor at the rate of 8% of the Original Issue Price of the Series A Preferred Stock per share per annum on
each outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock prior and in preference to payment of any dividend on
the Common Stock of the Company. Dividends with respect to the Series C Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock, and Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 2(b) shall be payable only when, as,
and if declared by the Board of Directors; provided, however, that the Board of Directors is under no
obligation to pay dividends to such holders, and such dividends, if any, shall be noncumulative, For the
avoidance of doubt, no dividends shall be paid on the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or
Series C Preferred Stock unless the full dividend payable to the Series D Preferred Stock upon an IPO or
Liquidation Event has been paid.

/

{c) Additional Dividends. If and to the extent that after payment or setting aside for
payment of the dividends provided for in Section 2(a) and Section 2(b) above, the Board of Directors shall
declare and set aside for payment any further amount of cash or property as a Distribution (other than a
Distribution pursuant to Section 3 hereof}, such. Distribution shall be made with equal priority to the
Common Stock and the Preferred Stock, with each share of the Preferred Stock being treated for such
purpose as if it had been converted into Common Stock at the then effective Conversion Rate (as defined in
Section 4(a)). For such purposes, all shares of the Preferred Stock held by each holder of the Preferred
Stock shall be aggregated, and any resulting fractional share of Common Stock shall be disregarded.

(d) Priority of Dividends. The Company shall make no Distribution (as defined above)
to the holders of shares of Common Stock in any fiscal year unless and until dividends at the rates set forth
in subsections (a) and (b) above shall have been paid upon all shares of Series D Preferred Stock, Series C
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series A Preferred Stock.

(e) Consent to Certain Distributions. As authorized by Section 402.5(c) of the

such payinent is a payment made by the Company in connection with (i) repurchases of Common Stock
issued to or held by employees, officers, directors or consultants of the Company or its subsidiaries upon
termination of their employment or services pursuant to agreements providing for the right of said
repurchase, (ii) repurchases of Common Stock issued to or held by employees, officers, directors or
consultants of the Company or its subsidiaries pursuant to rights of first refusal contained in agreements
providing for such right, (iii) repurchases of Common Stock in connection with the settlement of disputes
with any shareholder, or (iv) any other repurchase or redemption of Common Stock approved by the holders

Company to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and
Common Stock by reason of their ownership of such stock, the amount of $0.6304 per share of Series D
Preferred Stock held by them (as adjusted for any Recapitalization with respect to the Series D Preferred
Stock) and, in addition, an amount equal to all accrued but unpaid dividends on such shares of Series D
Preferred Stock. If, upon a Liquidation Event, the assets and funds thus available for distribution among the
holders of the Series D Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of their
full aforesaid preferential amount, then the entire amount of the assets and funds of the Company legally
available for distribution shall be distributed ratably among the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock in
proportion to the aggregate Liquidation Preference, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series D
Preferred Stock, for the shares of such Series D Preferred Stock owned by each such holder.

(b) Series A, Series B and Series C Liquidation Preference. After the payment to the
holders of Series D Preferred Stock of the full amount specified in Section 3(a) above, the holders of Series
A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock, on a pari passu basis, shall be
entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any Distribution of any of the assets or surplus funds of the
Company to the holders of Common Stock by reason of their ownership of such stock the amounts of $0.57,
$1.09 and $2.15 per share, respectively, for each share of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock
or Series C Preferred Stock held by them (in each case, as adjusted for any Recapitalization with respect to
the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock, as the case may be) and,
in addition, an amount equal to all declared but unpaid dividends on such shares of Series A Preferred Stock,
Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock. If, upon a Liquidation Event, the assets and funds
thus available for distribution among the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock
and Series C Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of their full
aforesaid preferential amount, then the entire amount of the assets and funds of the Company legally
available for distribution shall be distributed ratably among the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock,
Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock in proportion to the aggregate Liquidation Preference,
plus all declared and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series
C Preferred Stock, for the shares of such Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C
Preferred Stock owned by each such holder.

(c) Distribution after Payment of Liquidation Preference. After the payments to the
holders of Preferred Stock of the full preferential amounts specified above, the entire remaining assets of the
Company legally available for distribution by the Company shall be distributed ratably among the holders of
Series D Preferred Stock and Common Stock in proportion to the number of shares of Common Stock held

4762562_8 ; -5-
by them, with the shares of Series D Preferred Stock being treated for this purpose as if they had been
converted to shares of Common Stock at the then applicable Series D Conversion Rate (as defined below).

(d) Deemed Liquidation. For purposes of this Section 3, unless otherwise agreed to by
the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, voting together as a single
class, a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company shall be deemed to be occasioned by, or to
include: (i) a merger or consolidation of the Company with or into any other entity or entities (but excluding
any merger effected solely for the purpose of reincorporating into another state) or the merger of any other
entity or entities into the Company, in either case in which the shareholders of the Company receive

' distributions in cash or securities of another entity or entities as a result of such consolidation or merger, and
in which the shareholders of the Company, immediately prior to such merger or consolidation, hold,
immediately after such merger or consolidation, less than a majority of the outstanding voting securities of
the surviving or successor entity or its parent, (ii) a sale, lease or other conveyance of all or substantially all
of the assets of the Company, or (iii) the sale, exclusive license or other transfer of all of the Company’s
intellectual property (each of (i), (ii) and (iii), an “Acquisition or Asset Transfer”).

(e) Non-Cash Distribution. Whenever the Distribution provided for in this Section 3
shall be payable in securities or property other than cash, the value of such Distribution shall be the fair
market value of such securities or other property as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors,
except that unless. otherwise valued in a merger or acquisition agreement approved by the Company’s
shareholders, any publicly-traded securities to be distributed to shareholders in a liquidation, dissolution, or
winding up of the Company shall be valued as follows:

(i) If the securities are then traded on a national securities exchange, then the
value of the securities shall be deemed to be to the average of the closing prices of the securities on such
exchange or system over the ten (10) trading day period ending five (5) trading days prior to the distribution;

(ii) if the securities are actively traded over-the-counter, then the value of the
securities shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid prices of the securities over the ten (10)
trading day period ending five (5) trading days prior to the distribution.

Gi) =n the event of a merger or other acquisition of the Company by another
entity, the distribution date shall be deemed to be the date such transaction closes.

For the purposes of this Section 3(e), “trading day” shall mean any day which the exchange or
system on which the securities to be distributed are traded is open and “closing prices” or “closing bid
prices” shall be deemed to be: (i) for securities traded primarily on the New York Stock Exchange, the
American Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, the last reported trade price or sale price, as the case may be, at 4:00
p-m., New York time, on that day and (ii) for securities listed or traded on other exchanges, markets and
systems, the market price as of the end of the regular hours trading period that is generally accepted as such
for such exchange, market or system. If, after the date hereof, the benchmark times generally accepted in
the securities industry for determining the market price of a stock as of a given trading day shall change
from those set forth above, the fair market value shall be determined as of such other generally accepted
benchmark times.

(f) Deemed Conversion. For purposes of determining the amount each holder of shares
of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and/or Series C Preferred Stock is entitled to receive
pursuant to this Section 3, each holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or
Series C Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have converted (regardless of whether such holder actually
converted or whether there are sufficient shares of authorized Common Stock to permit actual conversion of
all shares of Preferred Stock into Common Stock) such holder’s shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B

4762562_8 -6-
Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock into Common Stock immediately prior to a distribution pursuant
to this Section 3 if, as a result of an actual conversion, such holder would receive, in the aggregate, an
amount greater than the amount that would be distributed to such holder if such holder did not convert such
shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock into shares of
Common Stock. If any such holder shall be deemed to have converted shares of Preferred Stock into
Common Stock pursuant to this paragraph, then such holder shall not be entitled to receive any distribution
that would otherwise be made to holders of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series C
Preferred Stock that have not converted (or have not been deemed to have converted) into shares of
Common Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a Liquidation Event includes an earn-out,
escrow arrangement or other contingent payment not delivered to the Company’s shareholders at the initial
closing of such Liquidation Event, holders of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series C
Preferred Stock shal] not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock into Common Stock pursuant to
this Section 3(f) until such time such holders of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series
C Preferred Stock actually receive as a result of such deemed conversion an amount greater than the amount
to which it would otherwise be entitled pursuant to Section 3(b) above.

Conversion Price”) shall be $1.5215 and shall be subject to adjustment as provided herein. The number of
shares of Common Stock into which each share of Series C Preferred Stock may be converted is hereinafter
referred to as the “Series C Conversion Rate.” Upon any decrease or increase in the Series C Conversion

4762562_8 -7-
Price for a share of Series C Preferred Stock, as described in this Section 4, the corresponding Series C
Conversion Rate for such share of Series C Preferred Stock shall be appropriately increased or decreased.

Subject to Section 4(b), each share of the Series D Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option
of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share at the office of the Company or any

Common Stock that is equal to the Original Issue Price of the Series D Preferred Stock divided by the Series
D Conversion Price. The initial conversion price per share of Series D Preferred Stock (the “Series D
Conversion Price”) shall be the Original Issue Price of the Series D Preferred Stock and shall be subject to
adjustment as provided herein. The number of shares of Common Stock into which each share of Series D
Preferred Stock may be converted is hereinafter referred to as the “Series D Conversion Rate.” Upon any
decrease or increase in the Series D Conversion Price for a share of Series D Preferred Stock, as described in -
this Section 4, the corresponding Series D Conversion Rate for such share of Series D Preferred Stock shal]
be appropriately increased or decreased.

(b) Automatic Conversion.

(i} Qualified Public Offering. Each share of Preferred Stock shall
- automatically be converted into fully paid, non-assessable shares of Common Stock at the then effective
Conversion Rate for such share immediately upon the consummation of an underwritten public offering of
Common Stock registered under the Securities Act at a price per share (prior to underwriting commissions
and offering expenses) which reflects a valuation of the Company (before receipt of any proceeds from the
public offering) of at least $100 million and with aggregate net proceeds to the Company of at least $40
million (a “Qualified Public Offering”). In the event of the automatic conversion of the Preferred Stock in
connection with a Qualified Public Offering, the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable
upon such conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock
immediately prior to the closing of such sale and issuance of securities.

(ii) | Shareholder Vote. Each share of each series of Preferred Stock shall
automatically be converted into fully paid, non-assessable shares of Common Stock at the then effective
Conversion Rate for such share immediately upon (A) with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B

Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class and (B) with respect to the
Series D Preferred Stock, the receipt by the Company of a written consent or vote for such conversion from
the holders of at least a majority of the then-outstanding Series D Preferred Stock. In the event of the
automatic conversion of the Preferred Stock by written consent or vote, the person(s) entitled to receive the
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have converted
such Preferred Stock immediately prior the effectiveness of such written consent or vote.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued
upon conversion of the Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would otherwise
be entitled upon conversion of the Preferred Stock by such holder (after all fractional shares arising from
such holder’s conversion have been aggregated into the greatest possible number of whole shares), the
Company shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the then fair market value of such fractional
shares as determined by the Board of Directors. Before any holder of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to

4762562_8 -8-
convert the same into full shares of Common Stock, and to receive certificates therefor, they shall either
(i) surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Company or of any
transfer agent for the Preferred Stock or (ii) notify the Company or its transfer agent that such certificates
have been lost, stolen or destroyed and execute an agreement satisfactory to the Company to indemnify the
Company from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates, and shall give written notice to
the Company at such office that they elect to convert the same; provided, however, that in the event of an
automatic conversion pursuant to Section 4(b) above, the outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock shall be
converted automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the
certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Company or its transfer agent; provided, further,
that the Company shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon such automatic conversion unless either the certificates evidencing such shares of the
Preferred Stock are delivered to the Company or its transfer agent as provided above, or the hoider notifies
the Company or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an
agreement satisfactory to the Company to indemnify the Company from any loss incurred by it in
connection with such certificates.

The Company shall, as soon as practicable after such delivery, or after receipt of such agreement
and indemnification, if any, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of the Preferred Stock, a
certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which the holder shall be entitled as
aforesaid and a check payable to the holder in the amount of any cash amounts payable as the result of a
conversion into fractional shares of Common Stock, plus any declared and unpaid dividends on the
converted Preferred Stock. Such conversion ‘shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the
close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of the Preferred Stock to be converted, and the
person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be
treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date;
provided, however, that if the conversion is in connection with a public offering or a Liquidation Event, the
conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering the Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned
upon the closing of the sale of securities pursuant to such public offering, or such Liquidation Event, in
which event the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of the
Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the
closing or consummation of the public offering or Liquidation Event.

(d) Conversion Price Adjustments for Sales of Shares Below Conversion Price. The
Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

@) (A) (1) If the Company shall issue, at any time after the Original Issue
Date, any Additional Stock (as defined below) without consideration or for a consideration per share less
than the Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock, the
Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall automatically (except as
otherwise provided in this Section 4(d)(i)) be adjusted to a price determined by multiplying the Series A
Conversion Price by a fraction, (x) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such issuance (the “Outstanding Common”) plus the number of shares of
Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received by the Company for such issuance would purchase
at the Series A Conversion Price; and (y) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of
Outstanding Common plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock. For purposes of this Section
A(d)(i)(A), the term “Outstanding Common” shall include all shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock.

(2) If the Company shall issue, at any time after the Original Issue
Date, any Additional Stock (as defined below) without consideration or for a consideration per share less
than the Series D Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock, the

4762562_8 -9-
Series B Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall automatically (except as
otherwise provided ih this Section 4(d)(i)) be adjusted to a price determined by multiplying the Series B
Conversion Price by a fraction, (x) the numerator of which shall be the Outstanding Common plus the
number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received by the Company for such
issuance would purchase at the Series D Conversion Price; and (y) the denominator of which shall be the
number of shares of Outstanding Common plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock.

(3) If the Company shall issue, at any time after the Original Issue
Date, any Additional Stock (as defined below) without consideration or for a consideration per share less
than the Series D Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock, the
Series C Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall automatically (except as
otherwise provided in this Section 4(d)(i)) be adjusted to a price determined by multiplying the Series C
Conversion Price by a fraction, (x) the numerator of which shall be the Outstanding Common plus the
number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received by the Company for such
issuance would purchase at the Series D Conversion Price; and (y) the denominator of which shall be the
number of shares of Outstanding Common plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock.

(4) If the Company shall issue, at any time after the Original Issue
Date, any Additional Stock (as defined below) without consideration or for a consideration per share less
than the Series D Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock, the
Series D Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shal] automatically (except as
otherwise provided in this Section 4(d)(i)) be adjusted to a price determined by multiplying the Series D
Conversion Price by a fraction, (x) the numerator of which shall be the Outstanding Common plus the
number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received by the Company for such
issuance would purchase at the Series D Conversion Price; and (y) the denominator of which shall be the
number of shares of Outstanding Common plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock.

(B) No adjustment of the applicable Conversion Price shall be made if
the amount of such reduction would be less than $0.01. Except to the limited extent provided for in Sections
4(d)(i)(E)(3) and 4(d)(1)(E)(4), no adjustment of such Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4(d)(i) shall
have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price above the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to
such adjustment.

(C) In the case of the issuance of Additional Stock for cash, the
consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting any reasonable
discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the Company for any underwriting or
otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

(D) In the case of the issuance of the Additional Stock for a
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be deemed to be the
fair market value thereof as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors irrespective of any
accounting treatment.

{E) In the case of the issuance (whether before, on or after the filing of
the Fourth Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation) of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for
Common Stock, securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock or options to
purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or exchangeable securities, the following provisions

47625628 -10--
without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments
affecting such stock) of such securities, options to purchase, or rights to subscribe for Common Stock shall
be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities, options or rights were issued and for a
consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in Sections 4(d){i)(C) and
4(d)(i)(D)), if any, received by the Company upon the issuance of such securities, options or rights plus the
minimum exercise price provided in such securities, options or rights (without taking into account potential
antidilution adjustments affecting such stock) for the Common Stock covered thereby.

(2) The aggregate maximum number of shares of Common
Stock deliverable upon conversion of or in exchange (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to

account potential antidilution adjustments affecting such stock) for any such convertible or exchangeable
securities or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or
exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof shall be deemed to have been issued
at the time such securities were issued or such options or rights were issued and for a consideration equal to
the consideration, if any, received by the Company for any such securities and related options or rights
(excluding any cash received by the Company on account of accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the
minimum additional consideration, if any, to be received by the Company (without taking into account
potential antidilution adjustments affecting such stock) upon the conversion or exchange of such securities
or the exercise of any related options or rights (the consideration in each case to be determined in the
. manner provided in Sections 4(d)(i)(C) and 4(d)()(D)).

Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to the Company upon exercise of such options or
rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such convertible or exchangeable securities (excluding a
change resulting from any antidilution provisions contained in such options, rights or securities), the
Conversion Price, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, rights or securities,
shall be recomputed to reflect such change, but no further adjustment shall be made for the actual issuance
of Common Stock or any payment of such consideration upon the exercise of any such options or rights or
the conversion or exchange of such securities.

(4) Upon the expiration of any such options or rights, the
termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options or rights related to
such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Conversion Price, to the extent in any way affected by or
computed using such options, rights or securities or options or rights related to such securities, shall be
recomputed to reflect the issuance of only the number of shares of Common Stock (and convertible or
exchangeable securities which remain in effect) actually issued upon the exercise of such options or rights,

upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or upon the exercise of the options or rights related to
such securities.

(5) The number of shares of Common Stock deemed issued

Stock. In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided (by stock split, stock

dividend, or otherwise) into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such subdivision shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such subdivision, be
proportionately decreased. In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined or
consolidated (by reclassification, reverse stock split or otherwise) into a Jesser number of shares of Common
Stock, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such combination or consolidation shall,
concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination or consolidation, be proportionately increased.

(ii) Adjustments for Other Distributions. In the event the Company at any time
or from time to time makes or fixes a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled
to receive any Distribution payable in securities of the Company, then and in each such event provision shall
be made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock shall receive upon such Distribution the amount of
securities of the Company which they would have received had their Preferred Stock converted into
Common Stock on the date of such event and had they thereafter, during the period from the date of such
event to and including the date of conversion, retained such securities receivable by them as aforesaid during

4762562_8 , -12-
such period, subject to all other adjustments called for during such period under this Section 4 with respect
to the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock.

(iii) Adjustments for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. If the
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or a
different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization,
reclassification or otherwise (other than a-subdivision or combination of shares provided for above), the
Conversion Price then in effect shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such reorganization or
teclassification, be proportionately adjusted such that.the Preferred Stock shall be convertible into, in lieu of
the number of shares of Common Stock which the holders would otherwise have been entitled to receive, a
number of shares of such other class or classes of stock equivalent to the number of shares of Common
Stock that would have been subject to receipt by the holders upon conversion of the Preferred Stock
immediately before that change.

be entitled to receive upon conversion of the Preferred Stock held by them the number of shares of stock or
other securities or property to which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon
conversion would have been entitled on such capital reorganization, merger or consolidation. In any such
case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 4 with respect
to the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock after the capital reorganization, merger or consolidation to
the end that the provisions of this Section 4 (including adjustment of the Conversion Price then in effect and
the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event
and be as nearly equivalent as practicable. -

(f) Certificate_as_ to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of any Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4, the Company at its expense shall compute
such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to each holder of the

holder of the Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth
(1) such adjustments and readjustments, (ii) the Conversion Prices at the time in effect, and (iii) the number
of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received
upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock.

contrary, any downward adjustment of the Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock may be waived by the
consent or vote of the holders of at least a majority of the then-outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock,

(iii) and (iv) above or (B) the closing date of such event; provided, however, the notice provisions set forth
in this section may be shortened or waived by the vote or written consent of the holders of at least a majority
of the then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class. With regard to the
matters referenced in (iii) and (iv) above, such written notice shall describe the material terms and
conditions of the proposed transaction.

Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not
be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then-outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, the Company will
take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but
