1. Dividends.

(a) The holders of the then outstanding Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
reccive, when and as declared by the Board of Directors, out of assets legally available therefor,
prior and in preference to any declaration or payment of any dividend or other transfer of cash or
properties by the Corporation to one or more stockholder without consideration (a
“Distribution’”’) on the Common Stock (payable other than in Common Stock or other securities
or rights convertible into or entitling the holder thereof to receive, directly or indirectly,
additional shares of Common Stock), dividends at the annual rate of $0,052 per share of Series A
Preferred Stock and $0.648 per share of Series B Preferred Stock, each as adjusted for any stock
splits, reverse stock splits, stock dividends, and similar recapitalization events (eacha _

dividend (including the amount of any dividends paid or Distributions made pursuant to the
above provisions of this Section 1) is paid with respect to all outstanding shares of Preferred
Stock in an amount for each such share of Preferred Stock equal to or greater than the aggregate
amount of such dividends for all shares of Common Stock into which each such share of
Preferred Stock could then be converted. Payments of any dividends to the holders of each such
series of Preferred Stock shall be paid pro rata, on an equal priority, pari passu basis according to
their respective dividend preferences as set forth herein. The right to dividends on shares
Preferred Stock shall not be cumulative, and no right shall accrue to holders of Preferred Stock
by reason of the fact that dividends on said shares are not declared in any period, nor shall any

treated for this purpose as holding the greatest whole number of shares of Common Stock then
issuable upon conversion of all shares of Preferred Stock held by such holder pursuant to
Section 3.

payable in property other than cash, the value of such dividend or Distribution shall be deemed
to be the fair market value of such property as determined in good faith by the Board of

issuable upon conversion of the shares of Preferred Stock then held, by each holder, until,

(i) with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock, such holders have received an aggregate of two
times the Original Series A Price (including amounts received pursuant to Section 2(a)) at which
tine the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall no longer share ratably in the assets then
remaining for distribution, and (ii) with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock, such holders
have received an agpregate of two times the Original Series B Price (including amounts received.
pursuant to Section 2(a)) at which time the holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall no longer

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the
option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share, at the office of

nonassessable shares of Common Stock, with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock, equal to
the Original Series A Price divided by the Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred Stock in
effect at the time of conversion, and with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock, equal to the
Original Series B Price divided by the Conversion Price for the Series B Preferred Stock in effect
at the time of conversion. The Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred Stock shall initially
be $0.65 and the Conversion Price for the Series B Preferred Stock shall initially be $0.81, each
subject to adjustment as provided in Section 3(d) below.

S- 1 or Form SB-2 (or a successor form) under the Securities Act of 1933 covering the offer and
sale of Common Stock at an offering price of not less than three times the Original Series B
Purchase Price, as adjusted for any Recapitalization Event, with aggregate gross proceeds to the
Corporation (prior to underwriters’ commissions and expenses) of not less than $25,000,000.

transfer agent for the Corporation and shall give written notice to the Corporation at such office
that the holder elects to convert the same and shall state therein the name or names in which the
certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued (except that no such
written notice of election to convert shall be necessary in the event of an automatic conversion
pursuant to Section 3(b) hereof). The Corporation shall promptly issue and deliver at such office
to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which he shall be entitled as aforesaid.
Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business
on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted (except that, in the
case of an automatic conversion upon an initia] public offering pursuant to Section 3(b), such
conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the closing of the offering)
and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such
conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of
Common Stock on such date. Upon the occurrence of either of the events specified in Section
3(b) above, the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically without
any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates representing
such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent; provided, however, that the
Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion unless either the certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred
Stuck are delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent as provided above, or the holder

fixed, as of the close of business on such record date.

(B) Except as provided in paragraphs (C) and (D) below, no further

ugyreyate amount of cash received by the Corporation before deducting any reasonable
discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the Corporation for any

issued pursuant to Section 3(d) relating to Options and Convertible Securities shall be equal to:

(x) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by
the Corporation as consideration for the issuance of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus
the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments
relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of
such consideration) payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the

Conversion Price for such series in effect immediately prior to such subdivision, combination or
consolidation shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such subdivision, combination or
consolidation, be proportionately adjusted.

(B) Common Stock Dividends and Distributions. If, after the
Original Issue Date of a series of Preferred Stock, the Corporation at any time or from time to
time issues, or fixes a record date for determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to
receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock, then in
each such event, as of the time of such issuance or, in the event such record date is fixed, as of
the close of business on such record date, the Conversion Price for such series that is then in
effect shall be decreased by multiplying the Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction, (x) the
numerator of which ts the number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding

(y} the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of business on such record ‘date plus
the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution;
provided, however, that if such record date is fixed and such dividend or distribution is not paid
in full on the date fixed therefor, the Conversion Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the
close of business on such record date and thereafter the Conversion Price shall be adjusted
pursuant to this Section 3(d)(v)(B) to reflect the actual payment of such dividend or distribution.

assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights (excluding options to purchase and rights
to subscribe for Common Stock or other securities of the Corporation convertible into or
exchangeable for Common Stock), or shall fix a record date for determination of holders of
Common Stock entitled to reccive such a distribution, then, in each such case, provision shall be
made so that the holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, upon conversion thereof,
in addition to the number of shares of Common Stock receivable thereupon, the amount of
securities of the Corporation that they would have received had their Preferred Stock been
converted into Common Stock on the date of such event (or on the record date with respect
thereto, if such record datc is fixed) and had they thereafter, during the period from the date of
such event to and including the date of conversion, retained such securities receivable by them as
aloresaid during such periad, subject to all other adjustments called for during such period under
this Section 3 with respect to the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock.

affected by such recapitalization or reorganization, provision shall be made so that the holders of
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, upon conversion thereof, the number of shares of
stock or other securities or property of the Corporation or otherwise that they would have
received had their Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event

Caras Cary. PACS 9
?S02sa-5
(ar on the record date with respect thereto, if such record date is fixed) and had they thereafter,
during the period from the date of such event to and including the date of conversion, retained
such securities receivable by them as aforesaid during such period, subject to all other
adjustments called for during such period under this Section 3 with respect to the rights of the
holders of the Preferred Stock.

readjustment of the Conversion Price for a series of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 3,
the Corporation at its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in
accordance with the terms hercof and furnish to each holder of a share of such series of Preferred
Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts
upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based including the consideration received for
any Additional Shares of Common Stock issued. The Corporation shall, upon the written request
at any time of any holder of a Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be fumished to such holder a
like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and readjustments, (ii) the Conversion Price at
the time in effect for the series of Preferred Stock held by such holder and (iii) the number of
shares of Common Stock and the type and amount, if any, of other property which at the time
would be received upon the conversion of a share of such series of Preferred Stock.

(f) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued
upon conversion of shares of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder
of Preferred Stock would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such
fraction multiplied by the fair market value of one share of Common Stock as determined by the
Board of Directors of the Corporation. The number of whole shares issuable to each holder of a
series of Preferred Stock upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the number of
shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the total number of shares of such series
being converted into Common Stock by such holder at that time.

(g) Notices of Record Date. In the event (i) the Corporation shall take a record
of the holders of its capital stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend or other

recapitalization (other than a subdivision or combination of its outstanding shares of Common

least 20 days prior to the earliest date hereinafter specified, a notice stating the material terms of
the proposed transaction and the date on which (x) a record is to be taken for the purpose of such
dividend, distribution or rights or (y) such reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization,
dissolution, liquidation or winding up is to take place and the date, if any is to be fixed, as of
which holders of capital stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their shares of capital stock
for securities or other property deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification,
recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or winding up; provided, however, that such notice
period may be shortened upon the written consent of holders of Preferred Stock that are entitled
lo such notice rights or similar notice rights and that that represent at least a majority of the
voting power of all then outstanding shares of such Preferred Stock. If any material change in

ray Caryrass

notice of such material change to cach holder of shares of Preferred Stock.

(h) No Impairment. Without obtaining such consent of the holders of Preferred
Stock as may be required under Section 5, the Corporation will not, by amendment of its
Certificate of Incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation,
merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seck to

by the Corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the
provisions of this Section 3 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or
appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holders of Preferred Stock against
impairment.

(i) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at
all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock,

solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Preferred Stock, such number of its
shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion
of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to
such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.

4. Voting Rights.

(a) General, Each holder of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to one
vote for each share thereof held. Each holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a number of
votes equal to the number of whole shares of Common Stock into which such holder’s shares of
Preferred Stock could then be converted and, except as otherwise required by law or as set forth
herein, shall have voting rights and powers equal to the voting rights and powers of the Common
Stock. Each holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to notice of any stockholders’ meeting in
accordance with the bylaws of the Corporation and shall be entitled to vote together as a single
class with the holders of Common Stock with respect to any matter upon which holders of
Common Stock have the right to vote, except as otherwise provided herein or those matters
required by law to be submitted to a separate class vote. The number of authorized shares of
Common Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then
outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of shares of stock of the Corporation
