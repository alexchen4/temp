3, Conversion, The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights
as follows (the "Conversion Rights"):

(a) Right to Convert.

(i) Each shares of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option
of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share, at the office of the
corporation or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, into such number of fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stook as is detenmimed by dividing $0.20 for each share of
Preferred Stock by the Conversion Price at the time in effect for such share. The initial Conversion
Price for shares of Preferred Stock shall be $0.20 per share (the "Conversion Price"); provided,
however, that such Conversion Price shall] be subject to adjustment as set forth in subsection 3(c).

(ii) Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be
converted into shares of Common Stock at the then effective Conversion Price upon the con-
summation of the corporation's sale of its Common Stock in a bona fide, firm commitment
underwriting pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the "Securities Act"), which results in aggregate gross cash proceeds to the corporation in excess
of $10,000,000 and the public offering price of which Is not less than $5.00 per share (adjusted to

3
reflect subsequent stock dividends, stock splits or recapitalizations). In the event of the antomatic
conversion of the Preferred Stock upon a public offering as set forth above, the person(s) entitled
to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of Preferred Stock shall not be
deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such sale:
of securities,

Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall
be entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock, he shall surrender the certificate or
certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the corporation or of any transfer agent for such
stock, and shall give written notice by mail, postage prepaid, to tbe corporation at ils principal
corporate office, of the election to convert the samc and shall state therein the name or names in
which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued. The corporation
shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred
Stock, or to the nominee or naminess of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of
shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid. Such conversion shall
be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of busimess on the date of such
surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to
receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes
as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock as of such date. Ifthe conversion is
in connection with an underwritten offer of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act, the
conversion will be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriter of the sale of securities
pursuant to such offering, unless otherwise designated in writing by the holders of such Preferred
Stock, in which event ihe person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such
conversion of the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until
inamediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities.

(c) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock. The Conversion
Price of the Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

(i) (A) Ifthe corporation, at any time or from time to time after
the date of the first issuance of shares of Preferred Stock (the "Purchase Date"), shall issue any
Additional Stock (as defined below) without consideration or for a consideration per share less than
the Conversion Price in effect on the date of and immediately prior to the issuance of such
Additional Stuck, then and ia such event, the Conversion Price shall be reduced concurrently with
such issuance, to a price determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the
numicrator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding and the number of
sharcs of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the shares of Preferred Stock outstanding
immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares of Conmnon Stock which the aggregate
consideration received by the corporation for the total number of shares of Additional Stock so
issued would purchase at such Conversion Price, and the denominator of which shall be the number
of shares of Common Stock outstanding and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
the conversion of the shares of Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance plus
the number of such shares of Additional Stock so issued. for the purposes of this subsection, the
nunober of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue shal] be calculated
ona fully dilulcd basis, as iall shares of Preferred Stock and all convertible sccuritics had becn fully

4
convested into shares af Common Stock immediately prior to such issuance and any outstanding
watrants, options or other rights for the purchase of shares of stock or convertible securities had been
fully exercised immediately prior to such issuance (and the resulting securities fully converted into
shares of Common Stock, ifso convertible) as of such date, but not including in such calculation any
additional shares of Common Stock issuable with respect to shares of Preferred Stock, convertible
securities, or outstanding options, warrants or othet nghts for the purchase of shares of stock or
convertible securities, solely as a rcsult of the adjustment of the Conversion Price (or other
conversion ratios) resulting from the issuance of the Additional Stock causing the adjustment in
question. Immediately after any Additional Stock is deemed issued, such Additional Stock shall be
deemed to be outstanding.

(B) = Noadjustment of the Conversion Price for the Preferred
Stock sball be made in an amount less than one cent per share, provided that any adjustments which
are not required to he made by reason of this sentence shall be carried forward and shall be either
taken into account in any subsequent adjustment made prior to 3 years from the date of the event
giving rise to the adjustment being carricd forward, or shall be made at the end of 3 years from the
date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward. Except to the limited extent
provided for in subsections (E)(3) and (E)(4), no adjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this
subsection 3(c¢}(i) shall have the cffect of mcreasing the Conversion Price above the Conversion
Price in effect upmediately prior to such adjustment.

(C) Inthe case of the issuance of Common Stock forcash,
the considcration shail be deomed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting any
reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the corporation for
any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

(@) Inthe case of the issuance of the Common Stock fora
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be deemed
to be the fair value thereof as determined by the Board of Directors irrespective of any accounting
treatment.

(EB) in the case of the issuance, whether before, on or uflcer
the Purchase Datc, of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common Stock, securitics by
their terms convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock or options to purchase or rights to
subscribe for such convertible or exchaugeable securities (which are not excluded from the definition
of Additional Stock), the following provisions shall apply:

Common. Stock deliverable upon exercise of such options to purchase or rights to subscribe for

rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Conversion Price of the Preferred
Stock obtained with respect to the adjustment which was made upon the issuance of such options,

based thereon, shall be recomputed to reflect the issuance of only the number of shares of Common
Stock actually issued upon the exercise of such options or rights, upon the conversion or exchange of
