GDSVF&H\668819.2
shares that this corporation is authorized to issue is 39,270,662. The total number of shares of
common stock authorized to be issued is 25,000,000, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common
Stock”). The total number of shares of preferred stock authorized to be issued is 14,270,662, par
value $0.0001 per share (the “Preferred Stock”), of which 9,270,662 shares are designated as
“Series A Preferred Stock” and 5,000,000 shares are designated as “Series B Preferred Stock.”

B. Rights, Preferences _and_ Restrictions of Preferred Stock. The rights,
preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to and imposed on the Preferred Stock are as set

forth below in this Article IV(B).
1. Dividend Provisions.

(a) The holders of shares of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive
dividends, out of any assets legally available therefor, prior and in preference to any declaration
or payment of any dividend (payable other than in Common Stock or other securities and rights
convertible into or entitling the holder thereof to receive, directly or indirectly, additional shares
of Common Stock of this corporation) on the Common Stock of this corporation, at the
applicable Dividend Rate (as defined below), payable when, as and if declared by the Board of
Directors. Such dividends shall not be cumulative. The holders of the outstanding Preferred
Stock can waive any dividend preference that such holders shall be entitled to receive under this
Section 1 upon the affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the
shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding (voting together as a single class and not as separate
series, and on an as-converted basis). For purposes of this subsection 1(a), “Dividend Rate” shall
mean $0.0345 per annum for each share of Series A Preferred Stock and $0.0499 per annum for
each share of Series B Preferred Stock (each as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends,
combinations, subdivisions, recapitalizations or the like).

(b) After payment of such dividends, any additional! dividends or distributions
shall be distributed among all holders of Common Stock and Preferred Stock in proportion to the
number of shares of Common Stock that would be held by each such holder if al} shares of
Preferred Stock were converted to Common Stock at the then effective conversion rate.

D Liquidation Preference.

(a) In the event of any Liquidation Event (as defined below), either voluntary
or involuntary, the holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, prior and in preference
to any distribution of the proceeds of such Liquidation Event (the “Proceeds”) to the holders of
Common Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount per share equal to the sum of the
applicable Original Issue Price (as defined below) for such Preferred Stock, plus declared but
unpaid dividends on such share. If, upon the occurrence of such event, the Proceeds thus
distributed among the holders of the Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit the payment
to such holders of the full aforesaid preferential amounts, then the entire Proceeds legally
available for distribution shall be distributed ratably among the holders of the Preferred Stock in
proportion to the full preferential amount that each such holder is otherwise entitled to receive
under this subsection (a). For purposes of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation, “Original
Issue Price” shall mean $0.431469 per share for each share of the Series A Preferred Stock and
$0.624136 per share for each share of the Series B Preferred Stock (each as adjusted for any

GDS VF&H\668819.2 2
stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, subdivisions, recapitalizations or the like with
respect to such Preferred Stock).

(b) | Upon completion of the distribution required by subsection (a) of this
Section 2, all of the remaining Proceeds available for distribution to stockholders shall be
distributed among the holders of Common Stock pro rata based on the number of shares of
Common Stock held by each.

(c) (i) For purposes of this Section 2, a “Liquidation Event” shall include
(A) the closing of the sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of this
corporation’s assets, (B) the exclusive license by the corporation of all or substantially all of the
corporation's intellectual property to a third party, (C) the consummation of the merger or
consolidation of this corporation with or into another entity (except a merger or consolidation in
which the holders of capital stock of this corporation immediately prior to such merger or
consolidation continue to hold at least 50% of the voting power of the capital stock of this
corporation or the surviving or acquiring entity immediately following such merger or
consolidation), (D) the closing of the transfer (whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise), in
one transaction or a series of related transactions, to a person or group of affiliated persons (other
than an underwriter of this corporation’s securities), of this corporation’s securities if, after such
closing, such person or group of affiliated persons would hold 50% or more of the outstanding
voting stock of this corporation (or the surviving or acquiring entity) or (E) a liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of this corporation; provided, however, that a transaction shall not
constitute a Liquidation Event if its sole purpose is to change the state of this corporation’s
incorporation or to create a holding company that will be owned in substantially the same
proportions by the persons who held this corporation’s securities immediately prior to such
transaction. Notwithstanding the prior sentence, the sale of shares of capital stock by this
corporation in a financing transaction for capital raising purposes shall not be deemed a
“Liquidation Event.” The treatment of any particular transaction or series of related transactions
as a Liquidation Event may be waived by the vote or written consent of the holders of at least
two-thirds of the outstanding Preferred Stock.

(ii) —‘In any Liquidation Event, if Proceeds received by this corporation
or its stockholders is other than cash, its value will be deemed its fair market value. Any
securities shall be valued as follows:

(A) Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar
restrictions on free marketability covered by (B) below:

(1) If traded on a securities exchange or through the
Nasdaq National Market, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the
securities on such exchange or system over the twenty (20) trading-day period ending three (3)
trading days prior to the closing of the Liquidation Event;

(2) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall
be deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the
twenty (20) trading-day period ending three (3) trading days prior to the closing of the
Liquidation Event; and

GDSVF&H\668819.2 3
(3) If there is no active public market, the value shall be
the fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by the board of directors of this corporation
and the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock.

(B) The method of valuation of securities subject to investment
letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of
a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount
from the market value determined as above in (A) (1), (2) or (3) to reflect the approximate fair
market value thereof, as mutually determined by this corporation and the holders of at least two-
thirds of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of such Preferred Stock.

(iii) In the event the requirements of this Section 2 are not complied
with, this corporation shall forthwith either:

(A) cause the closing of such Liquidation Event to be
postponed until such time as the requirements of this Section 2 have been complied with; or

(B) cancel such transaction, in which event the rights,
preferences and privileges of the holders of the Preferred Stock shall revert to and be the same as
such rights, preferences and privileges existing immediately prior to the date of the first notice
referred to in subsection 2(c)(iv) hereof.

(iv) This corporation shall give each holder of record of Preferred
Stock written notice of such impending Liquidation Event not later than twenty (20) days prior to
the stockholders’ meeting called to approve such transaction, or twenty (20) days prior to the
closing of such transaction, whichever is earlier, and shall also notify such holders in writing of
the final approval of such transaction. The first of such notices shall describe the material terms
and conditions of the impending transaction and the provisions of this Section 2, and this
corporation shall thereafter give such holders prompt notice of any material changes. The
transaction shall in no event take place sooner than twenty (20) days after this corporation has
given the first notice provided for herein or sooner than ten (10) days after this corporation has
given notice of any material changes provided for herein; provided, however, that subject to
compliance with the General Corporation Law such periods may be shortened or waived upon
the written consent of the holders of Preferred Stock that represent at least two-thirds of the
voting power of all then outstanding shares of such Preferred Stock.

3. Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion
rights as follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at
the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share, at the office
of this corporation or any transfer agent for such stock, into such number of fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the applicable Original
Issue Price for such series by the applicable Conversion Price for such series (the conversion rate
for a series of Preferred Stock into Common Stock is referred to herein as the “Conversion Rate”
for such series), determined as hereafter provided, in effect on the date the certificate is

GDS VF&H\668819.2 4
surrendered for conversion. The initial Conversion Price per share for each series of Preferred
Stock shall be the Original Issue Price applicable to such series; provided, however, that the
Conversion Price for the Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in
subsection 3(d).

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically
be converted into shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Rate at the time in effect for such
series of Preferred Stock immediately upon the earlier of (i) this corporation’s sale of its
Common Stock in a firm commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to a registration
statement on Form S-1 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the public offering price of
which was not less than $30,000,000 in the aggregate (before deduction of underwriters
commissions and expenses) (a “Qualified Public Offering’’) or (i1) the date specified by written
consent or agreement of the holders of at least two-thirds of the then outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to voluntarily convert the same into shares of Common Stock, he or she shall surrender
the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of this corporation or of any
transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to this corporation at its
principal corporate office, of the election to convert the same and shall state therein the name or
names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued. This
corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder
of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for
the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid. Such
conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the
date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons
entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated
for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock as of such date.
If the conversion is in connection with an underwritten offering of securities registered pursuant
to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the conversion may, at the option of any holder
tendering Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters
of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering, in which event the persons entitled to receive
the Common Stock upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have
converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities.
If the conversion is in connection with Automatic Conversion provisions of subsection 3(b)(ii)
above, such conversion shall be deemed to have been made on the conversion date described in
the stockholder consent approving such conversion, and the persons entitled to receive shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record
holders of such shares of Common Stock as of such date.

(d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock for Certain Dilutive
Issuances, Splits and Combinations. The Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock shall be

subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:
(i) (A) _ If this corporation shall issue, on or after the date upon

which this Restated Certificate of Incorporation is accepted for filing by the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware (the “Filing Date”), any Additional Stock (as defined below) without

GDS VF&H\668819.2 5
consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Conversion Price applicable to a
series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock, the
Conversion Price for such series in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall forthwith
(except as otherwise provided in this clause (i)) be adjusted to a price determined by multiplying
such Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Stock Outstanding (as defined below) immediately prior to such issuance plus the
number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received by this corporation
for such issuance would purchase at such Conversion Price; and the denominator of which shall
be the number of shares of Common Stock Outstanding (as defined below) immediately prior to
such issuance plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock. For purposes of this Section
3(d)(i)(A), the term “Common Stock Outstanding” shall mean and include the following: (1)
outstanding Common Stock, (2) Common Stock issuable upon conversion of outstanding
Preferred Stock, (3) Common Stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options and (4)
Common Stock issuable upon exercise (and, in the case of warrants to purchase Preferred Stock,
conversion) of outstanding warrants. Shares described in (1) through (4) above shall be included
whether vested or unvested, and whether exercisable or not yet exercisable.

(A) No adjustment of the Conversion Price for the Preferred
Stock shall be made in an amount less than one cent per share, provided that any adjustments that
are not required to be made by reason of this sentence shall be carried forward and shall be either
taken into account in any subsequent adjustment made prior to three (3) years from the date of
the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward, or shall be made at the end of three
(3) years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward. Except
to the limited extent provided for in subsections (E)(3) and (E)(4), no adjustment of such
Conversion Price pursuant to this subsection 3(d)(i) shall have the effect of increasing the
Conversion Price above the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment.

(B) In the case of the issuance of Additional Stock for cash, the
consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting any
reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by this
corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

(C) In the case of the issuance of the Additional Stock for a
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be
deemed to be the fair market value thereof as determined by the Board of Directors.

(D) In the case of the issuance of options to purchase or rights
to subscribe for Common Stock, securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for
Common Stock or options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or
exchangeable securities, the following provisions shall apply for purposes of determining the
number of shares of Additional Stock issued and the consideration paid therefor:

(1) The aggregate maximum number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable upon exercise (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to
exercisability, including without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account
potential antidilution adjustments) of such options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common
Stock shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such options or rights were issued and for

GDS VF&H\668819.2 6
a consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in subsections
3(d)(i)(C) and (d)(i)(D)), if any, received by this corporation upon the issuance of such options
or rights plus the minimum exercise price provided in such options or rights (without taking into
account potential antidilution adjustments) for the Common Stock covered thereby.

(2) The aggregate maximum number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of, or in exchange (assuming the satisfaction of any
conditions to convertibility or exchangeability, including, without limitation, the passage of time,
but without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) for, any such convertible or
exchangeable securities or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for
such convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof shall
be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or such options or rights
were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration, if any, received by this
corporation for any such securities and related options or rights (excluding any cash received on
account of accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the minimum additional consideration, if
any, to be received by this corporation (without taking into account potential antidilution
adjustments) upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or the exercise of any related
options or rights (the consideration in each case to be determined in the manner provided in
subsections 3(d)(i)(C) and (d)(i)(D)).

(3) In the event of any change in the number of shares
of Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to this corporation upon exercise
of such options or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such convertible or
exchangeable securities, the Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way
affected by or computed using such options, rights or securities, shall be recomputed to reflect
such change, but no further adjustment shall be made for the actual issuance of Common Stock
or any payment of such consideration upon the exercise of any such options or rights or the
conversion or exchange of such securities.

(4) Upon the expiration of any such options or rights,
the termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options or
rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Conversion Price of the
Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, rights or
securities or options or rights related to such securities, shall be recomputed to reflect the
issuance of only the number of shares of Common Stock (and convertible or exchangeable
securities that remain in effect) actually issued upon the exercise of such options or rights, upon
the conversion or exchange of such securities or upon the exercise of the options or rights related
to such securities.

(5) The number of shares of Additional Stock deemed
issued and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to subsections 3(d)(i)(D)(1) and (2)
shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or expiration of the type
described in either subsection 3(d)(i)(D)(3) or (4).

(ii) | “Additional Stock” shall mean any shares of Common Stock

issued (or deemed to have been issued pursuant to subsection 3(d)(i)(D)) by this corporation on
or after the Filing Date other than:

GDS VF&H\6688 19.2 7
(A) Common Stock issued pursuant to a transaction described
in subsection 3(d)(iii) hereof;

(B) Common Stock issued to employees, directors, consultants
and other service providers for the primary purpose of soliciting or retaining their services
pursuant to plans or agreements approved by this corporation’s Board of Directors in an
aggregate amount not to exceed 1,593,694 shares (plus such number of shares repurchased at
original cost by this corporation and such number of options cancelled in connection with the
termination of service); provided, however, that such number may be increased with the approval
of the corporation's Board of Directors (including at least one of the Series A Directors, as
defined below);

(C) Common Stock issued pursuant to an underwritten public
offering;

(D) Common Stock issued pursuant to the conversion or
exercise of convertible or exercisable securities outstanding on the Filing Date;

(E) Common Stock issued in connection with a bona fide
business acquisition of or by this corporation, whether by merger, consolidation, sale of assets,
sale or exchange of stock or otherwise;

(F) Common Stock issued or deemed issued pursuant to
subsection 3(d)(i)(D) as a result of a decrease in the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred
Stock resulting from the operation of Section 3(d);

(G) Common Stock issued in connection with joint ventures,
development projects or other strategic transactions in each case approved by this corporation’s
Board of Directors (including at least one of the Series A Directors, as defined below), provided
such issuances are for other than primarily equity financing purposes; or

(H) Common Stock issued to lease companies, real estate
lessors, banks or financial institutions in connection with commercial credit arrangements,
equipment financings, leases or similar transactions that in each case has been approved by this
corporation’s Board of Directors (including at least one of the Series A Directors, as defined
below), provided such issuances are for other than primarily equity financing purposes.

(iii) In the event this corporation should at any time or from time to
time after the Filing Date fix a record date for the effectuation of a split or subdivision of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock or the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled
to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock or other
securities or rights convertible into, or entitling the holder thereof to receive directly or
indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock (hereinafter referred to as “Common Stock
Equivalents”) without payment of any consideration by such holder for the additional shares of
Common Stock or the Common Stock Equivalents (including the additional shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof), then, as of such record date (or the date of
such dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no record date is fixed), the Conversion Price of
the Preferred Stock shall be appropriately decreased so that the number of shares of Common

GDS VF&H\668819.2 8
Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be increased in proportion to such
increase of the aggregate of shares of Common Stock outstanding and those issuable with respect
to such Common Stock Equivalents.

(iv) If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any time
after the Filing Date is decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of Common Stock,
then, following the record date of such combination, the Conversion Price for the Preferred Stock
shall be appropriately increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on
conversion of each share of such series shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in
outstanding shares.

(e) Other Distributions. In the event this corporation shall declare a
distribution payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by this
corporation or other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred
to in subsection 3(d), then, in each such case for the purpose of this subsection 3(e), the holders
of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any such distribution as though
they were the holders of the number of shares of Common Stock of this corporation into which
their shares of Preferred Stock are convertible as of the record date fixed for the determination of
the holders of Common Stock of this corporation entitled to receive such distribution.

(f) Recapitalizations. If at any time or from time to time there shall be a
recapitalization, reclassification or other change of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision,
combination or merger or sale of assets transaction provided for elsewhere in this Section 3 or in
Section 2) provision shall be made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock shall thereafter be
entitled to receive upon conversion of the Preferred Stock the number of shares of stock or other
securities or property of this corporation or otherwise, to which a holder of Common Stock
deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled on such recapitalization, reclassification or
other change. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the
provisions of this Section 3 with respect to the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock after
the recapitalization, reclassification or other change to the end that the provisions of this Section
3 (including adjustment of the Conversion Price then in effect and the number of shares
purchasable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event as nearly
equivalently as may be practicable.

(g) No Impairment. This corporation will not, without the appropriate vote of
the stockholders under the General Corporation Law and Section 5 of this Article IV(B), by
amendment of its Certificate of Incorporation or through any reorganization, recapitalization,
transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other
voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be
observed or performed hereunder by this corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in
the carrying out of all the provisions of this Section 3 and in the taking of all such action as may
be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the Conversion Rights of the holders of the
Preferred Stock against impairment.

GDS VF&H\6688 19.2 9
(h) No Fractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments.

(i) No fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of any
share or shares of the Preferred Stock and the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock to
be issued to particular stockholders, shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share and the
corporation shall pay in cash the fair market value of any fractional shares as of the time when
entitlement to receive such fractions is determined. Whether or not fractional shares would be
issuable upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of
Preferred Stock the holder is at the time converting into Common Stock and the number of
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion.

(ii) | Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the
Conversion Price of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 3, this corporation, at its expense,
shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and
prepare and furnish to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment
or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is
based. This corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of Preferred
Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (A) such
adjustment and readjustment, (B) the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock at the
time in effect, and (C) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other
property that at the time would be received upon the conversion of a share of Preferred Stock.

(i) Notices of Record Date. In the event of any taking by this corporation of a
record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof
who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend) or other distribution, any
right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of stock of any class or any other
securities or property, or to receive any other right, this corporation shall mail to each holder of
Preferred Stock, at least twenty (20) days prior to the date specified therein, a notice specifying
the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or
right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right.

(j) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. This corporation shall at

all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock,
solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock, such
number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, in addition to such other remedies as shall
be available to the holder of such Preferred Stock, this corporation will take such corporate
action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes,
including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval
of any necessary amendment to this Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

(k) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Section 3 to be
given to the holders of shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed given if deposited in the United

GDS VF&H\6688 19.2 10
States mail, by certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, and
addressed to each holder of record at his address appearing on the books of this corporation.

(1) Waiver of Adjustment to Conversion Price. Notwithstanding anything

herein to the contrary, any downward adjustment of the Conversion Price of any series of
Preferred Stock may be waived, either prospectively or retroactively and either generally or in a
particular instance, by the consent or vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding
shares of such series of Preferred Stock. Any such waiver shal] bind all future holders of shares
of such series of Preferred Stock.

4. Voting Rights.

(a) General Voting Rights. The holder of each share of Preferred Stock shall
have the right to one vote for each share of Common Stock into which such Preferred Stock
could then be converted, and with respect to such vote, such holder shall have full voting rights
and powers equal to the voting rights and powers of the holders of Common Stock, and shall be
entitled, notwithstanding any provision hereof, to notice of any stockholders’ meeting in
accordance with the Bylaws of this corporation, and except as provided in subsection 5(b) below
with respect to the election of directors by the separate class vote of the holders of Common
Stock, shall be entitled to vote, together with holders of Common Stock, with respect to any
question upon which holders of Common Stock have the right to vote. Fractional votes shall not,
however, be permitted and any fractional voting rights available on an as-converted basis (after
aggregating all shares into which shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder could be
converted) shall be rounded to the nearest whole number (with one-half being rounded upward).

(b) Voting for the Election of Directors. As long as a majority of the shares of
Series A Preferred Stock originally issued remain outstanding, the holders of such shares of
Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to elect two (2) directors of this corporation at any
election of directors (the “Series A Directors”). The holders of outstanding Common Stock shall
be entitled to elect one (1) director of this corporation at any election of directors. The holders of
Preferred Stock and the holders of Common Stock (voting together as a single class and not as
separate series, and on an as-converted basis) shall be entitled to elect any remaining directors of
this corporation.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 223(a)(1) and 223(a)(2) of the General
Corporation Law, any vacancy, including newly created directorships resulting from any
increase in the authorized number of directors or amendment of this Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, and vacancies created by removal or resignation of a director, may be filled by a
majority of the directors then in office, though less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining
director, and the directors so chosen shall hold office until the next annual election and until their
successors are duly elected and shall qualify, unless sooner displaced; provided, however, that
where such vacancy occurs among the directors elected by the holders of a class or series of

vacancy by (i) voting for their own designee to fill such vacancy at a meeting of the Company’s
stockholders or (ii) written consent, if the consenting stockholders hold a sufficient number of
shares to elect their designee at a meeting of the stockholders. Any director may be removed
during his or her term of office, either with or without cause, by, and only by, the affirmative

GDSVF&H\6688 19.2 1]
vote of the holders of the shares of the class or series of stock entitled to elect such director or
directors, given either at a special meeting of such stockholders duly called for that purpose or
pursuant to a written consent of stockholders, and any vacancy thereby created may be filled by
the holders of that class or series of stock represented at the meeting or pursuant to written
consent.

parity with, any series of Preferred Stock;
