upon conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would
otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to the product of such fraction
multiplied by the fair market value of a share of Common Stock, as mutually agreed by the
Board of Directors of the Corporation and the holders of a majority of the Series D Preferred
Stock and Series D-1 Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class and the holders of a
majority of the Series C Preferred Stock, voting separately as a single class; provided, however,
that if such mutual agreement cannot be reached, such fair market value shall be determined by
following the procedures set forth in the definition of Appraisal Procedure. The determination of
fractional shares shall be based on the aggregate number of shares of Preferred Stock surrendered
for conversion by any holder of Preferred Stock and not on the individual shares of Preferred
Stock held by such holder.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion.

(i) Notice of Conversion. In order for a holder of Preferred Stock to
convert shares of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the
certificate or certificates for such shares of Preferred Stock, at the office of the transfer agent for
the Preferred Stock (or at the principal office of the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its
own transfer agent), together with written notice that such holder elects to convert all or any
number of the shares of the Preferred Stock represented by such certificate or certificates. Such
notice shall state such holder’s name or the names of the nominees in which such holder wishes
the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued. Ifrequired by the
Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by a
written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly
executed by the registered holder or his or its attorney duly authorized in writing. The date of
receipt of such certificates and notice by the transfer agent (or by the Corporation if the
Corporation serves as its own transfer agent) shall be the conversion date (“Conversion Date”).
The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after the Conversion Date, issue and deliver at such
office to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to his or its nominees, a certificate or certificates for
the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled, together with cash
in lieu of any fraction of a share. On the Conversion Date, each holder of record of shares of
Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such Preferred Stock, notwithstanding that the
certificates evidencing such shares of Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered to such
holder.

(ii) Reservation of Shares. The Corporation shall at all times when
Preferred Stock shall be outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but
unissued stock, for the purpose of effecting the conversion of Preferred Stock, such number of its
duly authorized shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but
unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then
outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall take such corporate action as
may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such
number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging
in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to the
Certificate of Incorporation. Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment
reducing the Conversion Price below the then par value of the shares of Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take any corporate action which
may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Corporation may validly and
legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion
Price.

(iii) Effect of Conversion. All shares of Preferred Stock which shall
have been surrendered for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be
outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares, including the rights, if any, to receive
notices and to vote, shall immediately cease and terminate on the Conversion Date, except only
the right of the holders thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor and
payment of any dividends declared but unpaid thereon. Any shares of Preferred Stock so
converted shall be retired and cancelled and shall not be reissued, and the Corporation (without
the need for stockholder action) may thereafter take such appropriate action as may be necessary
to reduce the authorized number of shares of Preferred Stock accordingly.

(iv) Taxes. The Corporation shall pay any and all issue, transfer, stamp
and other taxes that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of Common
Stock upon conversion of shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4. The Corporation
shall not, however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer
involved in the issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in
which the shares of Preferred Stock so converted were registered, and no such issuance or
delivery shall be made unless and until the person or entity requesting such issuance has paid to
the Corporation the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the
Corporation, that such tax has been paid.

(d) Adjustments to Conversion Price for Diluting Issues:

(i) No Adjustment of Conversion Price. No adjustment pursuant to
subsection 4(d)(iti) in the Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock shall be made (a) unless the
consideration per share (determined pursuant to subsection 4(d)(iv) below) for Additional Shares
of Common Stock (as defined below) issued or deemed to be issued by the Corporation is less
than the applicable Conversion Price in effect on the date of, and immediately prior to, the issue
of such Additional Shares, for such series of Preferred Stock or (b) if prior to or within sixty (60)
days subsequent to such issuance, the Corporation receives written notice from the holders ofa
majority of the outstanding shares of such series of Preferred Stock, voting separately as a single
class, agreeing that no such adjustment shall be made with respect to such series of Preferred
Stock as the result of the issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock.

(ii) Issue of Securities Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common
Stock. If the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Filing Date shall issue any
Options or Convertible Securities (as such terms are defined below) or shall fix a record date for
the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to recetve any such Options or
Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set forth in
the instrument relating thereto, assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to exercisability,
convertibility or exchangeability, but without regard to any provision contained therein for a
subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case
of Convertible Securities and Options therefor, the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, shall be deemed to be Additional Shares of Common Stock issued as of the time of
such issue or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such
record date, provided that Additional Shares of Common Stock shall not be deemed to have been
issued unless the consideration per share (determined pursuant to subsection 4(d)(iv) below) of
such Additional Shares of Common Stock would be less than the applicable Conversion Price in
effect on the date of and immediately prior to such issue, or such record date, as the case may be,
and provided further that in any such case in which Additional Shares of Common Stock are
deemed to be issued:

(A) _ No further adjustment in the Conversion Price shall be
made upon the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities or shares of Common Stock upon the
exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities;

(B) If such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms
provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any increase or decrease in the consideration
payable to the Corporation, upon the exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, the Conversion
Price computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with
respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon any such increase or
decrease becoming effective, be recomputed to reflect such increase or decrease insofar as it
affects such Options or the rights of conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities;

(C) | Upon the expiration of any such Options or any rights of
conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have been exercised,
the Conversion Price computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence ofa
record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon
such expiration, be recomputed as if:

(1) In the case of Convertible Securities or Options for
Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common Stock issued were the
shares of Common Stock, if any, actually issued upon the exercise of such
Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities and the
consideration received therefor was the consideration actually received by the
Corporation for the issue of all such Options, whether or not exercised, plus the
consideration actually received by the Corporation upon such exercise, or for the
issue of all such Convertible Securities which were actually converted or
exchanged, plus the additional consideration, if any, actually received by the
Corporation upon such conversion or exchange; and

(2) in the case of Options for Convertible Securities,
only the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof
were issued at the time of issue of such Options, and the consideration received
by the Corporation for the Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have
been then issued was the consideration actually received by the Corporation for
the issue of all such Options, whether or not exercised, plus the consideration
deemed to have been received by the Corporation (determined pursuant to
subsection 4(d)(iv) below) upon the issue of the Convertible Securities with
respect to which such Options were actually exercised;

9076168_5.docx 13
(D) In the event of any change in the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any Option or Convertible
Security, including, but not limited to, a change resulting from the anti-dilution provisions
thereof, the Conversion Price then in effect shall forthwith be readjusted to such Conversion
Price as would have been obtained had the adjustment which was made upon the issuance of
such Option or Convertible Security not exercised or converted prior to such change been made
upon the basis of such change; and

(E) Noreadjustment pursuant to clause (B), (C) or (D) above
shall have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price to an amount which exceeds the lower of
(i) the Conversion Price on the original adjustment date, or (11) the Conversion Price that would
have resulted from any issuances of Additional Shares of Common Stock between the original
adjustment date and such readjustment date.

(F) In the event the Corporation, after the Filing Date, amends
any Options or Convertible Securities (whether such Options or Convertible Securities were
outstanding on the Filing Date or were issued after the Filing Date) to increase the number of
shares issuable thereunder or decrease the consideration to be paid upon exercise or conversion
thereof, then such Options or Convertible Securities, as so amended, shall be deemed to have
been issued after the Filing Date and the provisions of this subsection 4(d)(ii) shall apply.

(G) Upon the expiration or termination of any unexercised
Option or unconverted or unexchanged Convertible Security (or portion thereof) which resulted
(either upon its original issuance or upon a revision of its terms) in an adjustment to the
Conversion Price pursuant to the terms of subsection 4(d)(iii), the Conversion Price shall be
readjusted to such Conversion Price as would have obtained had such Option or Convertible
Security (or portion thereof) never been issued.

(it) Adjustment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional
Shares of Common Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Filing Date
issue Additional Shares of Common Stock (including Additional Shares of Common Stock
deemed to be issued pursuant to subsection 4(d)(ii) above, but excluding Excluded Issuances and
shares issued as a stock split or combination as provided in subsection 4(e) below or upon a
dividend or distribution as provided in Subsection 4(f) below), without consideration or for a
consideration per share less than the applicable Conversion Price in effect on the date of and
immediately prior to such issue, then and in such event, such Conversion Price shall be reduced,
concurrently with such issue, to a price determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a
fraction, (A) the numerator of which shall be (1) the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such issue (on an As-Converted Basis (as defined below)) plus
(2) the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration received or to be
received by the Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so
issued would purchase at such Conversion Price; and (B) the denominator of which shall be (1)
the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue (on an As-
Converted Basis) plus (2) the number of such Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued
and/or deemed to be issued.

9076168_5.docx 14
(iv) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this

Subsection 4(d), the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional
Shares of Common Stock shall be computed as follows:

(A) | Cash and Property: Such consideration shall:

(1) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
aggregate of cash received by the Corporation, excluding amounts paid or payable
for accrued interest;

(2) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair market value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined
in good faith by the Board of Directors, or if requested by the holders of a
majority of the Series D Preferred Stock and Series D-1 Preferred Stock, voting
together as a single class and the holders of a majority of the Series C Preferred
Stock, voting separately as a single class, by agreement of the Board of Directors
and the holders of a majority of the Series D Preferred Stock and Series D-1
Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class and the holders of a majority of
the Series C Preferred Stock, voting separately as a single class, and if the Board
of Directors and the holders of a majority of the Series D Preferred Stock and
Series D-1 Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class, and the holders of a
majority of the Series C Preferred Stock, voting separately as a single class, do
not agree on such fair market value, in accordance with the procedures set forth in
the definition of Appraisal Procedure; and

(3) in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock
are issued together with other shares or securities or other assets of the
Corporation for consideration which covers both, be the proportion of such
consideration so received, computed as provided in clauses (1) and (2) above, as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(B) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per

share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been
issued pursuant to Subsection 4(d)(ii) above, relating to Options and Convertible Securities, shall
be determined by dividing

9076168_5.docx

(x) the total amount, if any, received by the Corporation
as consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities,
plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set
forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision
contained therein for a potential subsequent adjustment of such
consideration) payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such
Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, or
in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such
Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities, by

15
(y) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock
(as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any
provision contained therein for a potential subsequent adjustment of such
number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities.

(e) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If the Corporation shall at
any time or from time to time after the Filing Date effect a subdivision of the outstanding

Common Stock, the applicable Conversion Price then in effect immediately before that
subdivision shall be proportionately decreased so that the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be increased in proportion to such
increase in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. If the Corporation
shall at any time or from time to time after the Filing Date combine the outstanding shares of
Common Stock, the applicable Conversion Price then in effect immediately before the
combination shall be proportionately increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be decreased in proportion to such
decrease in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. Any adjustment
under this paragraph shall become effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or
combination becomes effective.

(f) Adjustment for Certain Dividends and Distributions. In the event the
Corporation at any time, or from time to time, after the Filing Date shall make or issue, or fix a
record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or
other distribution payable on the Common Stock solely in additional shares of Common Stock,
then and in each such event the Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock in effect
immediately before such event shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance or, in the event
such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, by
multiplying the Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock then in effect by a fraction:

(i) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the
close of business on such record date, and

(ii) | the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the
close of business on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in
payment of such dividend or distribution;

provided, however, (a) if such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend is not fully
paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the Conversion Price for
each series of Preferred Stock shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on
such record date and thereafter the Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock shall be
adjusted pursuant to this paragraph as of the time of actual payment of such dividends or
distributions; (b) that no such adjustment shall be made if the holders of Preferred Stock
simultaneously receive a dividend or other distribution of shares of Common Stock in a number
equal to the number of shares of Common Stock as they would have received if all outstanding
shares of such Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event.
(g) Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange or Substitution. If the
Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be changed into the

same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by capital
reorganization, reclassification, or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares
or stock dividend provided for above, or a reorganization, merger, consolidation, or sale of assets
provided for below), then and in each such event the holder of each such share of Preferred Stock
shall have the right thereafter to convert such share into the kind and amount of shares of stock
and other securities and property receivable, upon such reorganization, reclassification, or other
change, by holders of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of
Preferred Stock might have been converted immediately prior to such reorganization,
reclassification, or change, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein.

(h) Adjustment for Merger or Reorganization, etc. In case of any
consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into another corporation or the sale of all or

substantially all of the assets of the Corporation to another corporation, each share of Preferred
Stock, if any, remaining outstanding after such consolidation, merger or sale shall thereafter be
convertible (or shall be converted into a security which shall be convertible) into the kind and
amount of shares of stock or other securities or cash or other property to which a holder of the
number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation deliverable upon conversion of such
Preferred Stock would have been entitled upon such consolidation, merger or sale; and, in such
case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions in this Section 4
set forth with respect to the rights and interest thereafter of the holders of the Preferred Stock, to
the end that the provisions set forth in this Section 4 (including provisions with respect to
changes in and other adjustments of the Conversion Price) shall thereafter be applicable, as
nearly equivalent a manner as may be practicable as before the consolidation or merger. If any
event occurs of the type contemplated by the provisions of this Section 4 but not expressly
provided for by such provisions (including, without limitation, the granting of stock appreciation
rights, phantom stock rights or other rights with equity features), then the Board of Directors of
the Corporation shall make an appropriate reduction in the Conversion Price so as to protect the
rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock.

(i) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation at its expense
shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable but in any event not later than 10 days thereafter,
compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to
each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment
(including the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property into which the Preferred
Stock is convertible) and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment
is based. The Corporation shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable but in any event not later
than 10 days thereafter, upon the written request at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock,
furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a similar certificate setting forth (i) such
adjustments and readjustments, (11) the Conversion Price then in effect, and (iii) the number of
shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of cash or other property which then would be
received upon the conversion of such Preferred Stock.

Gj) Notice of Record Date. In the event:

9076168_5.docx 17
(i) that the Corporation declares a dividend (or any other distribution)
on its Common Stock payable in Common Stock or other securities of the Corporation;

(ii) that the Corporation subdivides or combines its outstanding shares
of Common Stock;

(iii) of any reclassification of the Common Stock of the Corporation
(other than a subdivision or combination of its outstanding shares of Common Stock or a stock
dividend or stock distribution thereon), or of any consolidation or merger of the Corporation into
or with another corporation, or of the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Corporation; or

(iv) of the involuntary or voluntary dissolution, liquidation or winding
up of the Corporation;

then, and in each such case, the Corporation shall cause to be filed at its principal office or at the
office of the transfer agent of the Preferred Stock, and shall cause to be mailed to the holders of
Preferred Stock at their last addresses as shown on the records of the Corporation or such transfer
agent, at least ten days prior to the date specified in (A) below or twenty days before the date
specified in (B) below, a notice stating the amount per share and character of such exchange
applicable to the Preferred Stock and the Common Stock and specifying, as the case may be,
either (A) the record date of such dividend, distribution, subdivision or combination, or, if a
record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of Common Stock of record to be
entitled to such dividend, distribution, subdivision or combination are to be determined, or

(B) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, dissolution, liquidation
or winding up is expected to become effective, and the date as of which it is expected that
holders of Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock
for securities or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger,
sale, dissolution or winding up.

5, Mandatory Conversion.

(a) Trigger Events — General. Upon (1) the vote of the holders of a majority of
the Series D Preferred Stock and Series D-1 Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class and
the vote of the holders of a majority of the Series C Preferred Stock, voting separately as a single
class, or (ii) the closing of a Qualified Public Offering (as defined below), all outstanding shares
of Preferred Stock shall be automatically converted into shares of Common Stock into which
such Preferred Stock is convertible pursuant to Section 4 above and such shares of Preferred
Stock may not be reissued by the Corporation.

(b) ‘Trigger Event — Bridge Financing. If any Preferred Stockholder, together
with its Affiliated Purchasers, does not purchase, on or before the Closing Deadline, its entire
Pro Rata Share of the securities offered to such Preferred Stockholder in the Bridge Financing,
then each share of each series of Preferred Stock then held by such Preferred Stockholder shall
automatically, upon the Closing Deadline and without further action on the part of such Preferred
Stockholder, be converted into one (1) fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock;
provided, however, that forgoing shall only apply so long as the Corporation has offered the
affected Preferred Stockholder the right to participate in the Bridge Financing, whether such
participation right is pursuant to contract or otherwise, and subjects all Preferred Stockholders to
this subsection 5(b) (the earlier of the events described in subsection 5(a), clause (i) or (ii), or
this subsection 5(b), the “Mandatory Conversion Date”).

(c) Procedural Requirements. All holders of record of shares of Preferred
Stock shall be given written notice of the Mandatory Conversion Date and the place designated
for mandatory conversion of all such shares of Preferred Stock, pursuant to this Section 5. Such
notice shall be sent to each record holder of Preferred Stock at such holder’s address last shown
on the records of the transfer agent for the Preferred Stock (or the records of the Corporation, if it
serves as its own transfer agent). Upon receipt of such notice, each holder of shares of Preferred
Stock shall surrender his, her or its certificate or certificates for all such shares (or, if such holder
alleges that such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and
agreement reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against any
claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or
destruction of such certificate) to the Corporation at the place designated in such notice. On the
Mandatory Conversion Date, all rights with respect to the Preferred Stock so converted,
including the rights, if any, to receive notices and vote (other than as a holder of Common Stock)
will terminate, except only the rights of the holders thereof, upon surrender of their certificate or
certificates therefor, to receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which
such Preferred Stock has been converted, and payment of any accrued and/or declared but unpaid
dividends thereon. If so required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion
shall be endorsed or accompanied by written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form
satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or by his or its attorney
duly authorized in writing. As soon as practicable after the Mandatory Conversion Date and the
surrender of the certificate or certificates for Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall cause to be
issued and delivered to such holder, or on his, her or its written order, a certificate or certificates
for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable on such conversion in accordance with
the provisions hereof, together with cash as provided in subsection 4(b) above in lieu of any
fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion and payment of
any declared but unpaid dividends on the shares of Preferred Stock so converted. On the
Mandatory Conversion Date, each holder of record or shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed
to be the holder of record of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such Preferred
Stock, notwithstanding that the certificates representing such shares of Preferred Stock shall not
have been surrendered at the office of the Corporation, that notice from the Corporation shall not
have been received by any holder of record of shares of such Preferred Stock, or that the
certificates evidencing such shares of Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered to such
holder.

(d) All certificates evidencing shares of Preferred Stock which are required to
be surrendered for conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof shall, from and after the
Mandatory Conversion Date, be deemed to have been retired and cancelled and the shares of
Preferred Stock represented thereby converted into Common Stock for all purposes,
notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender such certificates on or
prior to such date. The Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate action (without the
need for stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized Preferred Stock
accordingly.
6. Protective Covenants.

(b) At any time when any shares of the Series D-1 Preferred Stock are
outstanding, the consent of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of the

Stock being redeemed on such Mandatory Redemption Date, each holder of Preferred Stock will
cease to have any rights as a stockholder of the Corporation by reason of the ownership of such
redeemed shares of Preferred Stock (except for the right to receive the Mandatory Redemption
Price therefor upon the surrender of the certificate or certificates representing the redeemed
shares if such certificate or certificates have not been surrendered), and such redeemed shares of
