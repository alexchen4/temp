the Corporation or any transfer agent for the Series D Preferred Stock, Series C Stock, Series C-1
Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series A Preferred Stock, into such number of fully paid and

C-1 Stock, $1.85, in the case of the Series B Preferred Stock, and $1.00, in the case of the Series

Series B Preferred Stock and Series A Preferred Stock, respectively) by the Series D Conversion
Price, Series C Conversion Price, Series C-! Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price and

been called for redemption under Section 6 hereof shall terminate at the close of business on the

23666652_8 DOC

day fixed for redemption unless the Corporation shall default in the payment of the redemption
price, in which case the right of conversion with respect to such shares shall continue unless and
until such redemption price is paid in full.

(b) Automatic Conversion.

(i) Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into
shares of Common Stock at the Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series C-
1 Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price or Series D Conversion Price, as the case may be,
then in effect upon the closing of a firm commitment underwritten public offering led by an
investment banking firm acceptable to the holders of two-thirds of the then outstanding Series D
Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class,
pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
covering the offer and sale of Common Stock for the account of the Corporation to the public at
an offering price per share of not less than $3.70 per share, if such public offering is closed on or
before March 31, 2009, or $5.55 per share, if such public offering is closed after March 31, 2009
(in each case as adjusted to reflect any stock dividends, distributions, combinations,
reclassifications or other like transactions effected by the Corporation in respect of its Common
Stock) and with gross proceeds to the Corporation of not less than $50,000,000 (prior to
underwriters’ discounts and commissions) (in the event of which offering, the person(s) entitled
to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of the Preferred Stock shall not be
deemed to have converted the Preferred Stock until the closing of such offering).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Preferred Stock shall be subject to automatic
conversion pursuant to this Section 2(b)(i) in connection with an underwritten public offering
that otherwise meets the requirements of this Section 2(b)(i) (x) after March 31, 2009 at an
offering price per share that is between $3.70 and $5.55 (as adjusted to reflect any stock
dividends, distributions, combinations, reclassifications or other like transactions effected by the
Corporation in respect of its Common Stock), if the holders of at least two-thirds of the then
outstanding Series D Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, voting
together as a single class, shall have consented to such automatic conversion; or (y) at an
offering price per share that is less than $3.70 (as adjusted to reflect any stock dividends,
distributions, combinations, reclassifications or other like transactions effected by the
Corporation in respect of its Common Stock), if the holders of at least two-thirds of the then
outstanding Series B Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, and the holders of at least 75%
of the then outstanding Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Stock, voting together as a single
class, shall have consented to such automatic conversion.

(ii) In addition to the requirements of Section 2(b)(i) in connection
with an underwritten public offering, each share of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred
Stock, Series C-1 Stock, Series C Stock and Series D Preferred Stock shal] automatically be
converted into shares of Common Stock at the Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion
Price, Series C-1 Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price and Series D Conversion Price
then in effect, as the case may be, upon the written election of the holders of at least two-thirds
of the then outstanding shares of the Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and
Series D Stock, voting together as a single class, to require such mandatory conversion.

23666652_8.DOC
(c) Mechanics of Automatic Conversions. Upon the occurrence of an event
specified in Subsection 2(b), the applicable series of Preferred Stock shall be converted
automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the
certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent;
provided, however, that all holders of shares of Preferred Stock being converted shall be given
written notice of the occurrence of the event specified in Subsection 2(b) triggering such
conversion, including the date such event occurred (the “Mandatory Conversion Date”), and the
Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion unless certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock
being converted are either delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent, or the holder notifies
the Corporation or any transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen, or destroyed
and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from
any loss incurred by it in connection therewith. On the Mandatory Conversion Date, all rights
with respect to the applicable series of Preferred Stock so converted shall terminate, except any
of the rights of the holder thereof, upon surrender of the holder's certificate or certificates
therefor, to receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which such series
of Preferred Stock has been converted, together with cash in an amount equal to all dividends
declared but unpaid on, and any and all other amounts owing with respect to, the shares of
Preferred Stock converted to and including the time of conversion. Upon the automatic
conversion of the Preferred Stock, the holders of such Preferred Stock shal! surrender the
certificates representing such shares at the office of the Corporation or of its transfer agent. If so
required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or
accompanied by written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the
Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or by the holder’s attorney duly authorized
in writing. Upon surrender of such certificates there shall be issued and delivered to such holder,
or to such holder’s nominee or nominees promptly at such office, a certificate or certificates for
the number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Preferred Stock surrendered
were convertible on the date on which such automatic conversion occurred, together with cash in
an amount equal to all dividends declared but unpaid on, and any and all other amounts owing
with respect to, the shares of Preferred Stock converted to and including the time of conversion.
Upon the automatic conversion of the Preferred Stock, all shares of Preferred Stock being
converted by any holder thereof shall be aggregated for the purpose of determining the number
of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shal] be entitled, and no fractional share of
Common Stock shall be issued. In lieu of any fractional share to which the holder would
otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair
market value of the Common Stock on the Mandatory Conversion Date, as reasonably
determined by the Board of Directors in good faith.

(d) Mechanics of Optional Conversions. Before any holder of Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock, the holder shall surrender the
certificate or certificates therefor at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for the
Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the Corporation at such office that the holder
elects to convert the same and shall state therein the holder’s name or the name or names of the
holder’s nominees in which the holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common

23666652_8.DOC
Stock to be issued. On the date of conversion, all rights with respect to the Preferred Stock so
converted shall terminate, except any of the rights of the holder thereof, upon surrender of the
holder's certificate or certificates therefor, to receive certificates for the number of shares of
Common Stock into which such Preferred Stock has been converted and cash in an amount equal
to all dividends declared but unpaid on, and any and al! other amounts owing with respect to, the
shares of Preferred Stock being converted to and including the time of conversion. If so required
by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by
written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly
executed by the registered holder or by the holder’s attorney duly authorized in writing. Upon
the optional conversion of the Preferred Stock, all shares of Preferred Stock being converted by
any holder thereof shall be aggregated for the purpose of determining the number of shares of
Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled, and no fractional share of Common Stock
shall be issued. In lieu of any fractional share to which the holder would otherwise be entitled,
the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair market value of the
Common Stock on the date of conversion, as reasonably determined by the Board of Directors in
good faith. The Corporation shall, promptly after surrender of the certificate or certificates for
conversion, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to the holder’s
nominee or nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to
which the holder shall be entitled as aforesaid. together with cash in lieu of any fraction ofa
share and cash in an amount equal to all dividends declared but unpaid thereon and any and all
other amounts owing with respect thereto at such time. Unless otherwise specified by the holder
in the written notice of conversion, such conversion shall be deemed to have been made
immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred
Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such
shares of Common Stock on such date.

Securities or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities
entitled to receive any such Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of
shares (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto without regard to any provisions contained
therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) of Common Stock issuable upon the
exercise of such Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities and Options therefor, the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to be Additional Shares
of Common Stock issued as of the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shall have
been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, and the Series D Conversion Price,
Series C Conversion Price, Series C-1 Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series A
Conversion Price, as applicable, shall be adjusted accordingly, provided that in any such case in
which Additional Shares of Common Stock are deemed to be issued:

(A) no further adjustment in the Series D Conversion

shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities;

(B) if such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms
provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any increase in the consideration payable to
the Corporation, or decrease in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable, upon the
exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, the Series D Conversion Price, Series C Conversion
Price, Series C-1 Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series A Conversion Price
computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect
thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon any such increase or
decrease becoming effective, be recomputed to reflect such increase or decrease insofar as it
affects such Options or the rights of conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities:

Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series A Conversion Price computed upon the original issue
thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent
adjustments based thereon, shall, upon such expiration, be recomputed as if:

(1) In the case of Convertible Securities or Options
- for Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common Stock issued were the shares of
Common Stock, if any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities and the consideration received therefor was the
consideration actually received by the Corporation for the issue of all such Options, whether or
not exercised, plus the consideration actually received by the Corporation upon such exercise, or
for the issue of all such Convertible Securities which were actually converted or exchanged, plus
the additional consideration, if any, actually received by the Corporation upon such conversion
or exchange; and

(11) in the case of Options for Convertible
Securities only the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were
issued at the time of issue of such Options, and the consideration received by the Corporation for
the Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been then issued was the consideration
actually received by the Corporation for the issue of al] such Options, whether or not exercised,
plus the consideration deemed to have been received by the Corporation (determined pursuant to
Subsection 2(e)(v)) upon the issue of the Convertible Securities with respect to which such
Options were actually exercised;

(D) no readjustment pursuant to clause (B) or (C) above
shall have the effect of increasing the Series D Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price,
Series C-| Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series A Conversion Price to an
amount which exceeds the lower of (i) the Series D Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price,
Series C-! Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series A Conversion Price on the
original adjustment date, or (ii) the Series D Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price, Series
C-] Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series A Conversion Price that would have
resulted from any issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock between the original
adjustment date and such readjustment date;

(E) if such record date shall have been fixed and such
Options or Convertible Securities are not issued on the date fixed therefor, the adjustment
previously made in the Series D Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price, Series C-1
Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series A Conversion Price which became
effective on such record date shall be canceled as of the close of business on such record date,
and thereafter the Series D Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price, Series C-1 Conversion
Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series A Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this
Subsection 2(e)(iii) as of the actual date of their issuance.

Series D Preferred Stock, Series C Stock, Series C-1 Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series

A Preferred Stock:

(A) in the case of any such dividend or distribution,
immediately after the close of business on the record date for the determination of holders of any

Price, Series C Conversion Price, Series C-1 Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price and
Series A Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this Subsection 2(e)(iii) as of the time of
actual payment of such dividend or distribution.

(iv) Adjustment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional Shares

Series D Preferred Stock, Series C Stock, Series C-1 Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series A
Preferred Stock, as applicable, outstanding immediately prior to such issue shall be deemed to be
outstanding, and immediately after any Additional Shares of Common Stock are deemed issued
pursuant to Subsection 2(e)(iii), such Additional Shares of Common Stock shal! be deemed to be
outstanding.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this Subsection 2(e),
the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional Shares of Common
Stock shall be computed as follows:

(1) Cash and Property: Such consideration shall:

(A) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
aggregate amounts of cash received by the Corporation excluding amounts paid or payable for
accrued interest or accrued dividends;

(B) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors; and

(C) in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock are
issued together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for consideration

23666652_8.DOC
which covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in
clauses (A) and (B) above, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(2) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per
share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been

issued pursuant to Subsection 2(e)(iii)(1), relating to Options and Convertible Securities, shall be
determined by dividing (x) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Corporation as
consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the minimum
aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto,
without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such
consideration) payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the
exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities, by (y) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set forth in
the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a
subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities.

(vi) Adjustment for Dividends, Distributions, Subdivisions, Combinations
or Consolidations of Common Stock.

(1) Stock Dividends, Distributions or Subdivisions, In the event

Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price, Series C-1 Conversion Price, Series B Conversion
Price and Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately before such deemed issuance shall,
concurrently with the effectiveness of such deemed issuance, be proportionately decreased.

shares of Common Stock shall be combined or consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise,
into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, the Series D Conversion Price, Series C
Conversion Price, Series C-1 Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price and Series A
Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such combination or consolidation shall,
concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination or consolidation, be proportionately
increased.

(f) Adjustments for Certain Dividends and Distributions. In the event that at any
time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date the Corporation shall make or issue, or fix
a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or
other distribution payable in securities of the Corporation other than shares of Common Stock or
securities the issuance of which are deemed to be issuances of Common Stock under Subsection
2(e)(iii), then and in each such event provision shall be made so that the holders of Preferred
Stock shall receive upon conversion thereof in addition to the number of shares of Common
Stock receivable thereupon, the amount of securities of the Corporation that they would have
received had their Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock immediately prior to such

23666652_8.DOC
event and had they thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to and including the
conversion date, retained such securities receivable by them as aforesaid during such period,
giving application during such period to all adjustments called for herein.

(g) Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange, or Substitution. In the event that
at any time or from time to time after the applicable Original Issue Date the Common Stock
issuable upon the conversion of the applicable Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or
a different number of shares of any class or series of stock or other securities or property,
whether by capital reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise (other than a
subdivision or combination of shares or stock dividend provided for above, or a merger,
consolidation, or sale of assets provided for below), then and in each such event the holder of
any shares of the applicable Preferred Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such shares
into the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property receivable upon
such reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization or other change by the holder of a number
of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Common Stock into which such
shares of the applicable Preferred Stock might have been converted immediately prior to such
reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization or change, all subject to further adjustment as
provided herein.

(h) Adjustment for Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets. Subject to the
provisions of Subsection 1(c), in the event that, at any time or from time to time after the
applicable Original Issue Date, the Corporation shall merge or consolidate with or into another
entity or sell all or substantially all of its assets, and such consolidation, merger or sale is not
treated as a liquidation under Subsection 1{c), each share of Preferred Stock shall thereafter be
convertible into the kind and amount of shares of stock or other securities or property to which a
holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation deliverable upon
conversion of such Preferred Stock would have been entitled to receive upon such consolidation,
merger or sale; and, in such case, appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors) shall be made in the application of the provisions set forth in this Section 2
with respect to the rights and interest thereafter of the holders of shares of such Preferred Stock,
to the end that the provisions set forth in this Section 2 (including provisions with respect to
changes in and other adjustments of the Series D Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price,
Series C-1 Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price and Series A Conversion Price) shall
thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any shares of stock or
other securities or property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of such Preferred Stock.

(i) Special Mandatory Conversion.

(i) In the event that any holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock,
Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Stock or Series D Stock does not participate in a Qualified
Financing (as defined below) by purchasing in the aggregate, in such Qualified Financing and
within the time period specified by the Corporation (provided that the Corporation has given
such holder at least ten (10) days written notice of the Qualified Financing), such holder’s Pro
Rata Amount (as defined below), then the Applicable Portion of the shares of Preferred Stock
held by such holder shall automatically, and without any further action on the part of such

23666652_8.DOC
holder, be converted into shares of Common Stock at the applicable Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to the consummation of such Qualified Financing, effective upon, subject to,
and concurrently with, the consummation of the Qualified Financing. For purposes of
determining the number of shares of Preferred Stock owned by a holder, and for determining the
number of Offered Securities a holder of Preferred Stock has purchased in a Qualified Financing,
all shares of Preferred Stock held by Affiliates of such holder shall be aggregated with such
holder’s shares and all Offered Securities purchased by Affiliates of such holder shail be
aggregated with the Offered Securities purchased by such holder (provided that no shares or
securities shall be attributed to more than one entity or person within any such group of affiliated
entities or persons). Any such conversion is sometimes hereinafter referred to as a “Special
Mandatory Conversion.”

(ii) | Upon a Special Mandatory Conversion, each holder of shares of
Preferred Stock converted pursuant to Section 2(i)(i) shall surrender his, her or its certificate or
certificates for all such shares to the Corporation at the place designated in such notice, and shall
thereafter receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to this Section 2(i) and a new certificate for the number of shares, if any, of
Preferred Stock represented by such surrendered certificate and not converted pursuant to
Section 2(i)(i). If so required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be
endorsed or accompanied by written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to
the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or by the holder's attorney duly
authorized in writing. All rights with respect to the Preferred Stock converted pursuant to
Section 2(i)(i) shall terminate, except any of the rights of the holder thereof, upon surrender of
the holder’s certificate or certificates therefor, to receive certificates for the number of shares of
Common Stock into which such Preferred Stock has been converted, together with cash in an
amount equal to all dividends declared but unpaid on, and any and all other amounts owing with
respect to, the shares of Preferred Stock converted to and including the time of conversion, and a
new certificate for the number of shares, if any, of Preferred Stock represented by such
surrendered certificate and not converted pursuant to Section 2(i)(i). Upon the conversion of
shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 2(i)(i), all shares of Preferred Stock of any holder
thereof shall be aggregated for the purpose of determining the number of shares of Common
Stock to which such holder shall be entitled, and no fractional share of Common Stock shall be
issued. In lieu of any fractional share to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the
Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair market value of the
Common Stock on the date of such conversion, as reasonably determined by the Board of
Directors in good faith.

(iii) All certificates evidencing shares of Preferred Stock which are
required to be surrendered for conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof shall, from
and after the time of the Special Mandatory Conversion, be deemed to have been retired and
cancelled, and the shares of Preferred Stock converted pursuant to Section 2(i)(i) represented
thereby shall, from and after the time of the Special Mandatory Conversion, be deemed to have
been converted into Common Stock for all purposes, notwithstanding the failure of the holder or
holders thereof to surrender such certificates on or prior to such date. The Corporation may
thereafter take such appropriate action (without the need for stockholder action) as may be

23666652_8 DOC
17
necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of the applicable series of Preferred Stock
accordingly.

(iv) For purposes of this Section 2(i), the following definitions shall

Qualified Financing by a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the amount, if positive, by
which such holder’s Pro Rata Amount exceeds the number of Offered Securities actually
purchased by such holder in such Qualified Financing, and the denominator of which is equa] to
such holder’s Pro Rata Amount.

(3) “Offered Securities” shall mean the equity securities of the
Corporation set aside by the Board of Directors for purchase by holders of outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock in connection with a Qualified Financing, and offered to such holders.

on or about the Original Issue Date of the Series D Preferred Stock, as amended from time to
time (the “Investor Rights Agreement”), or (b) the maximum number of Offered Securities that
such holder is permitted by the Corporation to purchase in such Qualified Financing, after giving
effect to any cutbacks or limitations established by the Board of Directors or the other parties to

protect the Conversion Rights of the holders of Preferred Stock against impairment.

notice specifying the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such
dividend or distribution.

(m) Common Stock Reserved. The Corporation shall reserve and keep available,
free from pre-emptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock, solely for the
purpose of effecting the conversion of Preferred Stock, such number of shares of Common Stock
as shal] from time to time be sufficient to effect conversion of the Preferred Stock. If at any time
the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect
the conversion of all the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall
promptly take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to
increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall
be sufficient for such purpose.

(n) Certain Taxes. The Corporation shall pay any issue or transfer taxes payable
in connection with the conversion of Preferred Stock, provided, however, that the Corporation

timely conversion or transfer of such Preferred Stock or Common Stock.

(p) Validity of Shares. The Corporation agrees that it will from time to time take
all such actions as may be required to assure that all shares of Common Stock which may be
