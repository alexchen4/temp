or involuntary, the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, prior and
in preference to any distribution of the proceeds of such Liquidation Event (the “Proceeds”) to

899133 v4/HN
ownership thereof, an amount per share equal to the sum of two times the applicable Original

Following payment of this amount to the holders of Series A3 Preferred Stock, the holders of the
Series A2 Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any distribution

Stock at the then applicable Conversion Rate).

(c) For purposes of this Section 2, a “Liquidation Event” shall include (A) the
closing of the sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Corporation’s
assets, (B) the consummation of the merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into
another entity (except a merger or consolidation in which the holders of capital stock of the
Corporation immediately prior to such merger or consolidation continue to hold at least 50% of
the voting power of the capital stock of the Corporation or the surviving or acquiring entity),
(C) the closing of the transfer (whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise), in one transaction
or a series of related transactions, to a person or group of affiliated persons (other than an
underwriter of the Corporation’s securities), of the Corporation’s securities if, after such closing,
such person or group of affiliated persons would hold 50% or more of the outstanding voting
stock of the Corporation (or the surviving or acquiring entity), (D) the grant of an exclusive,
irrevocable license of all or substantially all of the Corporation’s intellectual property to a third

899133 va/HN
party or (E) a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation; provided, however, that
a transaction shall not constitute a Liquidation Event if its sole purpose is to change the state of
the Corporation’s incorporation, to consolidate with a wholly-owned subsidiary, or to create a
holding company that will be owned in substantially the same proportions by the persons who
held the Corporation’s securities immediately prior to such transaction. Notwithstanding the
prior sentence, the sale of shares of Preferred Stock in a financing transaction shall not be
deemed a “Liquidation Event.” The treatment of any particular transaction or series of related
transactions as a Liquidation Event may be waived by the vote or written consent of the holders
of a majority of the outstanding Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class and not as
separate series, and on an as-converted basis).

(i) In any Liquidation Event, if Proceeds received by the Corporation
or its stockholders are other than cash, their value will be deemed to be their fair market value.
Any securities shall be valued as follows:

(A) | Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar
restrictions on free marketability covered by (B) below:

(1) If traded on a securities exchange, the value shall be
based on the formula specified in the definitive agreements for the Liquidation Event, or, if no
such formula exists, then the value of such securities shall be based on a formula approved by the
Board and deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange over
the twenty (20) trading day period ending three (3) trading days prior to the closing of the
Liquidation Event;

(2) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall
be based on the formula specified in the definitive agreements for the Liquidation Event or, if no
such formula exists, then the value of such securities shall be based on a formula approved by the
Board and deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable)
over the twenty (20) trading day period ending three (3) trading days prior to the closing of the
Liquidation Event or such other formula as is determined in good faith by the Board; and

(3) If there is no active public market, the value shall be
the fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Board and the holders of at least
seventy percent (70%) of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock.

(B) The method of valuation of securities subject to investment
letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of
a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount
from the market value determined as above in (A) (1), (2) or (3) to reflect the approximate fair
market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Board and the holders of at least seventy
percent (70%) of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of such Preferred Stock.

(C) The foregoing methods for valuing non-cash consideration

to be distributed in connection with a Liquidation Event may be superseded by any determination
of such value set forth in the definitive agreements governing such Liquidation Event.

899133 v4/HN
(ii) In the event the requirements of this Section 2 are not complied
with, the Corporation shall forthwith either:

(A) cause the closing of such Liquidation Event to be
postponed until such time as the requirements of this Section 2 have been complied with; or

(B) cancel such transaction, in which event the rights,
preferences, privileges and restrictions of the holders of the Preferred Stock shall revert to and be
the same as such rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions existing immediately prior to the
date of the first notice referred to below.

The Corporation shall give each holder of record of Preferred Stock written notice
of such impending Liquidation Event not later than twenty (20) days prior to the stockholders’
meeting called to approve such transaction, or twenty (20) days prior to the closing of such
transaction, whichever is earlier, and shall also notify such holders in writing of the final
approval of such transaction. The first of such notices shall describe the material terms and
conditions of the impending transaction and the provisions of this Section 2, and the Corporation
shall thereafter give such holders prompt notice of any material changes, unless such notice
requirements are waived. The transaction shall in no event take place sooner than twenty (20)
days after the Corporation has given the first notice provided for herein or sooner than ten (10)
days after the Corporation has given notice of any material changes provided for herein;
provided, however, that subject to compliance with the General Corporation Law such periods
may be shortened or waived, either before or after the action for which notice is required, upon
the written consent of the holders of Preferred Stock that represent at least seventy percent (70%)
of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of such Preferred Stock (voting together as a
single class and not as separate series, and on an as-converted basis).

3, Redemption. The Preferred Stock is not redeemable.

4, Conversion. The holders of Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights
as follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Subject to Section 4(c), each share of Preferred Stock
shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of
such share, at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for such stock, into such number
of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the
applicable Original Issue Price for such series by the applicable Conversion Price for such series
(the conversion rate for a series of Preferred Stock into Common Stock is referred to herein as
the “Conversion Rate” for such series), determined as hereafter provided, in effect on the date
the certificate is surrendered for conversion. The initial Conversion Price per share for each
series of Preferred Stock shall be the Original Issue Price applicable to such series; provided,
however, that the Conversion Price for the Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment as set
forth in Section 4(d).

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically
be converted into shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Rate at the time in effect for such

899133 v4/HN
series of Preferred Stock immediately upon the earlier of (i) the Corporation’s sale of its
Common Stock in a firm commitment underwritten public offering, pursuant to a registration
statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), where the public
offering price is not less than three times the Original Issue Price for the Series C Preferred Stock
(as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, subdivisions, recapitalizations or
the like with respect to the Series C Preferred Stock) and results in aggregate gross proceeds to
the Corporation (before underwriting discounts, commissions and fees) of at least thirty million
dollars ($30,000,000) and the Common Stock of the Corporation is listed for trading on the TSX,
NYSE, NASDAQ or other recognized stock exchange acceptable to the holders of at least
seventy percent (70%) of the voting power of all the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock
(a “Qualifying IPO”) or (ii) the date specified by written consent or written agreement of the
holders of at least seventy percent (70%) of the then outstanding shares of Series C Preferred
Stock (voting as a separate class).

(c} Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to voluntarily convert such Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, the holder
shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed (or a reasonably acceptable
affidavit and indemnity undertaking in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate), at the
office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for such series of Preferred Stock, and shall
give written notice to the Corporation at its principal corporate office, of the election to convert
the same and shall state therein the name or names in which the certificate or certificates for
shares of Common Stock are to be issued. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable
thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or
nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock
to which such holder shal! be entitled as aforesaid and a certificate for the remaining number of
shares of Preferred Stock if less than all of the Preferred Stock evidenced by the certificate was
surrendered, Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close
of business on: (i) the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted or
(ii), if applicable, the date of automatic conversion specified in Section 4{b) above, and the
person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion
shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock
as of such date. If the conversion is in connection with an underwritten offering of securities
registered pursuant to the Securities Act, the conversion may, at the option of any holder
tendering Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters
of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering, in which event any persons entitled to receive
Common Stock upon conversion of such Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted
such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities. If the
conversion is in connection with automatic conversion provisions of Section 4(b)(ii) above, such
conversion shall be deemed to have been made on the conversion date described in the
stockholder consent approving such conversion, and the persons entitled to receive shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record
holders of such shares of Common Stock as of such date.

899133 v4/HN
(d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock for Certain Dilutive
Issuances, Splits and Combinations. The Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock shall be

subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

(i) Ifthe Corporation should issue, at any time after the date upon which
any shares of Series C Preferred Stock were first issued (the “Purchase Date”), any Additional
Stock (as defined below) without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the
Conversion Price applicable to the Series C Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to the
issuance of such Additional Stock (for the avoidance of doubt, no Preferred Stock Conversion
Price shall be adjusted for events prior to the issuance of such Preferred Stock, as applicable), the
Conversion Price for such series in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall
automatically (except as otherwise provided in this clause (i)) be adjusted to a price determined
by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, (x) the numerator of which shall be the
number of shares of Common Stock Outstanding (as defined below) immediately prior to such
issuance plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received
by the Corporation for such issuance would purchase at the applicable Conversion Price (and the
applicable Conversion Price for the Series Al Preferred Stock and Series A2 Preferred Stock
shall be the Series A3 Conversion Price); and (y) the denominator of which shall be the number
of shares of Common Stock Outstanding (as defined below) immediately prior to such issuance
plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock. For purposes of this Section 4(d)(i), the
term “Common Stock Outstanding” shall mean and include the following: (1) outstanding
Common Stock, (2) Common Stock issuable upon conversion of outstanding Preferred Stock, (3)
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options and (4) Common Stock
issuable upon exercise (and, in the case of warrants to purchase Preferred Stock, conversion) of
outstanding warrants. Shares described in (1) through (4) above shall be included whether
vested or unvested, whether contingent or non-contingent and whether exercisable or not yet
exercisable.

(A) No adjustment of the Conversion Price for the Preferred
Stock shall be made in an amount less than one cent per share, provided that any adjustments that
are not required to be made by reason of this sentence shall be carried forward and shail be either
taken into account in any subsequent adjustment made prior to three (3) years from the date of
the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward, or shall be made at the end of three
(3) years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 4(d)(i), except to the limited extent provided
for in Sections 4(d)(i)(D)(2) and 4(d)(i)(D)(3), no adjustment of such Conversion Price pursuant
to this Section 4(d)(i) shall have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price above the
Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment.

(B) Inthe case of the issuance of Additional Stock for cash, the
consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting any
reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the
Corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

899133 v4/HN
(C) In the case of the issuance of the Additional Stock for a
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be
deemed to be the fair market value thereof as determined by the Board irrespective of any
accounting treatment.

(D) In the case of the issuance of securities or rights convertible
into or entitling the holder therof to receive, directly or indirectly, additional shares of Common
Stock (the “Common Stock Equivalents”), the following provisions shall apply for purposes of
this Section 4(d)(i):

(1) The aggregate maximum number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable upon conversion, exchange or exercise (assuming the satisfaction of
any conditions to convertibility, exchangeability or exercisability, including without limitation,
the passage of time, but without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) of any
Common Stock Equivalents and subsequent conversion, exchange or exercise thereof shall be
deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or such Common Stock
Equivalents were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration, if any, received by
the Corporation for any such securities and related Common Stock Equivalents (excluding any
cash received on account of accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the minimum additional
consideration, if any, to be received by the Corporation (without taking into account potential
antidilution adjustments) upon the conversion, exchange or exercise of any Common Stock
Equivalents (the consideration in each case to be determined in the manner provided in Section

4(d)G)(C) and 4(d)(1)(D)).

(2) In the event of any change in the number of shares
of Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon
conversion, exchange or exercise of any Common Stock Equivalents, other than a change
resulting from the antidilution provisions thereof, the Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock, to
the extent in any way affected by or computed using such Common Stock Equivalents, shall be
recomputed to reflect such change, but no further adjustment shall be made for the actual
issuance of Common Stock or any payment of such consideration upon the conversion, exchange
or exercise of such Common Stock Equivalents.

(3) Upon the termination or expiration of the
convertibility, exchangeability or exercisability of any Common Stock Equivalents, the
Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using
such Common Stock Equivalents, shall be recomputed to reflect the issuance of only the number
of shares of Common Stock (and Common Stock Equivalents that remain convertible,
exchangeable or exercisable) actually issued upon the conversion, exchange or exercise of such
Common Stock Equivalents.

(4) The number of shares of Common Stock deemed
issued and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to Sections 4(d)(i)(D)(1) shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or expiration of the type described in
either Section 4(d)(i)(D)(2) or (3).

899133 v4/HN
(ii) For purposes of Section 4(d)(i), “Additional Stock” shall mean any
shares of Common Stock issued (or deemed to have been issued pursuant to Section 4(d){i)(D))
by the Corporation after an applicable Purchase Date other than:

(A) | Common Stock issued pursuant to a transaction described
in Section 4(d)(iii) hereof;

(B) Up to 12,193,152 shares of Common Stock issued or

stock, issued in connection with a bona fide business acquisition of or by the Corporation,
whether by merger, consolidation, sale of assets, sale or exchange of stock or otherwise, the
terms of which are approved by the Board;

(G) Common Stock issued or deemed issued pursuant to
Section 4(d)(i)(D) as a result of a decrease in the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred
Stock resulting from the operation of Section 4(d);

(H) Capital stock that is issued or issuable with the unanimous
approval of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, the Board specifically stating that it shall
not be Additional Stock;

bridge notes, or other rights outstanding as of the date of as of the first issuance of Series C
Preferred Stock, to acquire Common Stock or other shares or other securities convertible into or
exchangeable for Common Stock;

(J) Up to 360,000 shares of Common Stock (or shares of
Preferred Stock initially convertible into Common Stock) to financial institutions or lessors in
connection with commercial credit arrangements, equipment financings, commercial property
lease transactions, or similar transactions;

(K) Up to 720,000 shares of Common Stock (or shares of
Preferred Stock initially convertible into Common Stock) in strategic partnership transactions

899133 v4/HN
(L) Capital stock issued or issuable to persons or entities with
which the Corporation has business relationships, the terms of which issuances to such entity are
approved by the Corporation’s Board of Directors, including the Senior Preferred Director, and
stockholders holding at least 70% of the Corporation’s then outstanding Series C Preferred
Stock, and provided such issuances are for other than primarily equity financing purposes.

(iii) In the event the Corporation should, at any time after the Purchase
Date fix a record date for the effectuation of a split or subdivision of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock or the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive a dividend
or other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock or Common Stock
Equivalents (including the additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion or
exercise thereof), then, as of such record date (or the date of such dividend distribution, split or
subdivision if no record date is fixed), the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock
shall be appropriately decreased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on
conversion of each share of such series shall be increased in proportion to such increase of the
aggregate of shares of Common Stock outstanding and those issuable with respect to such
Common Stock Equivalents.

(iv) If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any time
after the Purchase Date is decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of Common
Stock, then, following the record date of such combination, the Conversion Price for the
Preferred Stock shall be appropriately increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be decreased in proportion to such
decrease in outstanding shares.

(e) Other Distributions. In the event the Corporation shall declare a
distribution (other than a subdivision, combination or merger or sale of assets transaction
provided for elsewhere in this Section 4 or in Section 2 of this Article TV(B)) payable in
securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by the Corporation or other persons,
assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred to in Section 4(d)(iii), then, in
each such case for the purpose of this Section 4(e), the holders of the Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to a proportionate share of any such distribution as though they were the holders of the
number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation into which their shares of Preferred
Stock are convertible as of the record date fixed for the determination of the holders of Common
Stock of the Corporation entitled to receive such distribution.

(f) Recapitalizations. If at any time or from time to time there shall be a
recapitalization of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision, combination or merger or sale
of assets transaction provided for elsewhere in this Section 4 or Section 2) provision shall be
made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon
conversion of the Preferred Stock the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of
the Corporation or otherwise, to which a holder of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion
would have been entitled on such recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall
be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 4 with respect to the rights of the
holders of the Preferred Stock after the recapitalization to the end that the provisions of this

11

899133 v4/HN
Section 4 (including adjustment of the Conversion Price then in effect and the number of shares
purchasable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event in as
nearly equivalent a manner as may be practicable.

(g) No Fractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments.

(i) No fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of any
share or shares of Preferred Stock and the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock to be
issued to particular stockholders shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share and the
corporation shall pay in cash the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board) of
any fractional shares, in lieu of issuing any such fractional shares, as of the time when
entitlements to receive such fractions are determined.

(ii) | Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the
Conversion Price of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation, at its expense,
shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and
prepare and furnish to each holder of such Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such
adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or
readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder
of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth
(A) such adjustment and readjustment, (B) the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred
Stock at the time in effect, and (C) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if
any, of other property that at the time would be received upon the conversion of a share of
Preferred Stock.

(h) Notices of Record Date. In the event of any taking by the Corporation of a
record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof
who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend) or other distribution, the
Corporation shali mail to each holder of Preferred Stock, at least ten (10) days prior to the date
specified therein, a notice specifying the date on which any such record is to be taken for the
purpose of such dividend, distribution, and the amount and character of such dividend or
distribution.

(i) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at
all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock,

solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock, such
number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, in addition to such other remedies as shall
be available to the holder of such Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate
action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes,
including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval
of any necessary amendment to this Restated Certificate.

12

899133 v4/HN
Qj) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Section 4 to be
given to the holders of shares of Preferred Stock (i) shall be deemed given if delivered
personally, sent via internationally recognized overnight courier service, via facsimile or
deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to each holder of record at
his address appearing on the books of the Corporation and (ii) may be waived by the holders of
at least seventy percent (70%) of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (voting together as a
single class and not as separate series, and on an as-converted basis).

(k) Waiver of Adjustment to Conversion Price. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, any downward adjustment of the Conversion Price of any series of

Preferred Stock may be waived, either prospectively or retroactively or in a particular instance,
by the consent or vote of the holders of at least seventy percent (70%) of the outstanding shares
of Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class and not as separate series, and on an as-
converted basis). Any such waiver shall bind all future holders of shares of such series of
Preferred Stock.

5. Voting Rights.

(a) General Voting Rights. The holder of each share of Preferred Stock shall
have the right to one vote for each share of Common Stock into which such Preferred Stock
could then be converted, and with respect to such vote, such holder shall have full voting rights
and powers equal to the voting rights and powers of the holders of Common Stock, and shall be
entitled, notwithstanding any provision hereof, to notice of any stockholders’ meeting in
accordance with the Bylaws of the Corporation, and, shall be entitled to vote, together with
holders of Common Stock, with respect to any question upon which holders of Common Stock
have the right to vote except as required by the General Corporation Law. Fractional votes shall
not, however, be permitted and any fractional voting rights available on an as-converted basis
(after aggregating all shares into which shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder could be
converted) shall be rounded to the nearest whole number (with one-half being rounded upward).

(b) Voting for the Election of Directors. As long as any shares of Series C or
Series B Preferred Stock are outstanding, the holders of the outstanding shares of Series C and
Series B Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class on an-converted basis, shall be entitled
to elect one (1) director of the Corporation at any election of directors (the “Senior Preferred
Director” or the “Series B Director”). As long as any shares of Series Al, Series A2 or Series
A3 Preferred Stock are outstanding, the holders of the outstanding shares of Series Al, Series A2
and Series A3 Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class on an as-converted basis, shall be
entitled to elect one (1) director of the Corporation at any election of directors (the “Series A
Director’). The holders of outstanding Common Stock shall be entitled to elect one (1) director
of the Corporation at any election of directors, who shall be the Chief Executive Officer of the
Corporation (the “Common Director”). The holders of the Common Stock and Preferred Stock,
voting together as a single class on an as-converted basis, shall be entitled to elect two (2)
directors of the Corporation at any election of directors, provided that such directors shall be
designated by the unanimous decision of the Series A Director, the Senior Preferred Director,
and the Common Director. Upon the approval by a majority of the then existing directors, the

13

899133 v4/HN
number of authorized directors of the Corporation may be increased by not more than two (2), at
which point such additional director(s) shall be elected in the manner set forth in the preceding
sentence. The Chairman shall be selected by the Board.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 223(a)(1) and 223(a)(2) of the General
Corporation Law, any vacancy, including newly created directorships resulting from any
increase in the authorized number of directors or amendment of this Restated Certificate, and
vacancies created by removal or resignation of a director, may be filled by a majority of the
directors then in office, though less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, and the
directors so chosen shall hold office until the next annual election and until their successors are
duly elected and shall qualify, unless sooner displaced; provided, however, that where such
vacancy occurs among the directors elected by the holders of a class or series of stock, the
holders of shares of such class or series may override the Board’s action to fill such vacancy by
(i) voting for their own designee to fill such vacancy at a meeting of the Corporation’s
stockholders or (ii) written consent, if the consenting stockholders hold a sufficient number of
shares to elect their designee at a meeting of the stockholders, Any director elected as provided
in the immediately preceding sentence hereof may be removed during the aforesaid term of
office, either with or without cause, by, and only by, the affirmative vote of the holders of the
shares of the class or series of stock entitled to elect such director or directors, given either at a
special meeting of such stockholders duly called for that purpose or pursuant to a written consent
of such stockholders.

(c) Protective Provisions.

(i) So long as at least 500,000 shares of Preferred Stock are
outstanding (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reclassification and the like), the
Corporation shall not (by amendment, merger, consolidation or otherwise) without first obtaining
the approval (by vote or written consent, as provided by law) of the holders of at least seventy-
five percent (75%) of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single
class on an as-converted basis:

(A) alter or change the rights, preferences or privileges of the
shares of Series Al, Series A2, Series A3, Series B or Series C Preferred Stock so as to affect

number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock;

(C) redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire (or pay into or set

shares of Common Stock from employees, officers, directors, consultants or other persons
performing services for the Corporation or any subsidiary pursuant to agreements under which
the Corporation has the option to repurchase such shares at no greater than cost upon the
occurrence of certain events, such as the termination of employment, or through the exercise of
any right of first refusal;

14

899133 v4sHN
(D) authorize or issue, any other equity security, including any
security (other than Series C Preferred Stock) convertible into or exercisable for any equity
security, having a preference over, or being on a parity with, the Series C Preferred Stock with
respect to voting (other than the pari passu voting rights of Common Stock), dividends,
conversion rights or liquidation preferences;

(E) amend, alter or repeal any provision of this Restated
Certificate or the Bylaws of the Corporation;

(F) enter into any agreement or arrangement with any party not
at arm’s length to the Corporation, other than such an agreement or arrangement entered into
(i) in the ordinary course of business, (ii) on fair market value terms and (iii) as unanimously
approved by directors not involved in such agreement or arrangement (other than a contractual
employment obligation between an employee and the Corporation which has been unanimously
approved by the Board);

(G) except as set forth in Section 5(b) above, increase or
decrease the number of authorized directors on the Board;

(H) engage in any action that results in the payment or

Stock for which an adjustment is made in the conversion of the Preferred Stock shares);

(1) effect a Liquidation Event;

(J) enter into any transaction between the Corporation and its
stockholders, officers or directors; or

(K) issue any debt securities or pledge or encumber of any of
the Corporation’s assets or make any guarantees.

Series A3 Preferred Stock are outstanding (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends,
reclassification and the like), the Corporation shall not (by amendment, merger, consolidation or
otherwise) without first obtaining the approval (by vote or written consent, as provided by law)
of the holders of at least sixty percent (60%) of the then outstanding shares of Series Al, Series
A2, or Series A3 Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class:

(A) alter or change the rights, preferences or privileges of the
shares of Series Al, Series A2, or Series A3 Preferred Stock so as to adversely affect the shares
of such series; or

(B) increase or decrease (other than by conversion) the total
number of authorized shares of Series Al, Series A2, or Series A3 Preferred Stock.

15

899133 v4/HN
Gii) So long as at least 500,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock are
outstanding (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reclassification and the like), the
Corporation shall not (by amendment, merger, consolidation or otherwise) without first obtaining
the approval (by vote or written consent, as provided by law) of the holders of at least seventy
percent (70%) of the then outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock, voting together as a
single class:

(A) alter or change the rights, preferences or privileges of the
shares of Series B Preferred Stock so as to affect adversely the shares of such series; or

(B) increase or decrease (other than by conversion) the total
number of authorized shares of Series B Preferred Stock.

(iv) So long as at least 500,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock are
outstanding (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reclassification and the like), the
Corporation shall not (by amendment, merger, consolidation or otherwise) without first obtaining
the approval (by vote or written consent, as provided by law) of the holders of at least seventy
percent (70%) of the then outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock, voting together as a
single class:

(A) alter or change the rights, preferences or privileges of the
shares of Series C Preferred Stock so as to affect adversely the shares of such series; or

(B) increase or decrease (other than by conversion) the total
number of authorized shares of Series C Preferred Stock.

6. Status of Converted Stock. In the event any shares of Preferred Stock
shall be converted pursuant to Section 4 hereof, the shares so converted shall be cancelled and
shall not be issuable by the Corporation. This Restated Certificate of the Corporation shall be
appropriately amended to effect the corresponding reduction in the Corporation’s authorized
capital stock.

C. Common Stock. The rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions
granted to and imposed on the Common Stock are as set forth below in this Article IV(C).

1. Dividend Rights. Subject to the prior rights of holders of all classes of
stock at the time outstanding having prior rights to dividends, the holders of the Common Stock
shall be entitled to receive, when, if and as declared by the Board, out of any assets of the
Corporation legally available therefor, such dividends as may be declared from time to time by
the Board.

2. Liquidation Rights. Upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation or the occurrence of a Liquidation Event, the assets of the Corporation shall be

holder.

4, Voting Rights. The holder of each share of Common Stock shall have the
right to one vote for each such share, and shall be entitled to notice of any stockholders’ meeting

and in such manner as may be provided by law. Subject to Section 6 of Division B of this
Article IV, the number of authorized shares of Common Stock may be increased or decreased
