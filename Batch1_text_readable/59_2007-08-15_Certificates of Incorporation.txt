DOCSOC/1 236977v2/010218-0005
Section 3. Liquidation Preference.

(a) In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of this corporation,
either voluntary or involuntary, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and Series S Preferred Stock, on a
pari passu basis, shall be entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any distribution of any of the
assets of this corporation to the holders of Common Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, an
amount per share equal to the purchase price originally paid by such holders of Series A Preferred Stock
and Series S Preferred Stock for each outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock and Series S
Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any stock dividends, contributions or splits with respect to such shares)
(the “Original Series A Issue Price” and “Original Series S Issue Price,” respectively), plus all declared
but unpaid dividends on such share. If upon the occurrence of such event, the assets and funds thus
distributed among the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series S Preferred Stock shall be
insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full aforesaid preferential amounts, then, the
entire assets and funds of the corporation legally available for distribution shall be distributed ratably
among the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series S Preferred Stock in proportion to the
preferential amount each such holder is otherwise entitled to receive.

(b) Upon the completion of the distribution required by subparagraph (a) of this
Section 3 the remaining assets of the corporation available for distribution to stockholders shall be
distributed among the holders of the Common Steck of this corporation pro rata based on the number of
shares of Common Stock held by each.

(c) (i) For purposes of this Section 3, unless the holders of at least two-thirds of
the then outstanding Series A Preferred Stock and Series S Preferred Stock, voting together as a single
class on an as-converted basis, elect otherwise, a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of this corporation
shall be deemed to be occasioned by, or to include, (A) the acquisition of the corporation by another
entity by means of any transaction or series of related transactions (including, without limitation, any
reorganization, merger (whether or not the corporation is a surviving entity after the merger, but,
excluding any merger effected exclusively for the purpose of changing the domicile of the corporation),
consolidation, issuance of capital stock by the corporation or sale of outstanding capital stock of the
corporation); (B) a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation; or
(C) the disposition by sale, assignment, license or otherwise of all or substantially all of the intellectual
property of the corporation (collectively, the events described in (A)-(C) of this Section 3(c){i) are
referred to herein as a “Deemed Liquidation Event”); provided, however, that in no event shall a Deemed
Liquidation Event be deemed to have occurred if the corporation’s stockholders of record as constituted
immediately prior to such acquisition, sale, disposition or license will, immediately after such acquisition,
sale, disposition or license (by virtue of securities issued as consideration for the corporation’s
acquisition, sale, disposition or license or otherwise) hold at least 50% of the voting power of the
surviving or acquiring entity.

(i1) If a Deemed Liquidation Event occurs, the holders of Series A Preferred
Stock and Series S Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive the greater of (A) the liquidation amount
set forth in subsection 3(a) above, or (B) the amount per share that would be received by the holders of
Series A Preferred Stock and Series S Preferred Stock and Common Stock based on the pro rata
ownership of shares of Common Stock held by each (assuming conversion of all such Series A Preferred
Stock and Series S Preferred Stock).

(iii) If a Deemed Liquidation Event occurs, if the consideration received by
the corporation is other than cash, its value wil] be deemed its fair market value. Any securities shall be
valued as follows:

DOCSOC/1236977v2/0102 18-0005
(A) Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar
restrictions on free marketability:

(1) If traded on a securities exchange or through the Nasdaq
National Market. the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on
such exchange over the thirty-day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing;

(2) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the thirty-day
period ending three (3) days prior to the closing; and

(3) If there is no active public market, the value shal] be the
fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by the corporation and the holders of at least a majority
of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series S Preferred
Stock, voting together as a single class on an as-converted basis.

(B) The method of valuation of securities subject to investment letter
or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of a
stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount from the
market value determined as above in (A) (1), (2) or (3) to reflect the approximate fair market value
thereof, as mutually determined by the corporation and the holders of at least a majority of the voting
power of all then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series S Preferred Stock, voting
together as a single class on an as-converted basis.

(iv) In the event the requirements of this subsection 3(c) are not complied
with, this corporation shall forthwith either:

(A) cause such closing to be postponed until such time as the
requirements of this Section 3 have been complied with; or

(B) cancel such transaction, in which event the nights, preferences
and privileges of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series S Preferred Stock shall revert to
and be the same as such rights, preferences and privileges existing immediately prior to the date of the
first notice referred to in subsection 3(c){v) hereof.

(v) The corporation shall give each holder of record of Series A Preferred
Stock and Series S Preferred Stock written notice of such impending transaction not later than twenty (20)
days prior to the stockholders’ meeting called to approve such transaction, or twenty (20) days prior to the
closing of such transaction, whichever is earlier, and shall also notify such holders in writing of the final
approval of such transaction. The first of such notices shall describe the material terms and conditions of
the impending transaction and the provisions of this Section 3, and the corporation shall thereafter give
such holders prompt notice of any material changes. The transaction shall in no event take place sooner
than twenty (20) days after the corporation has given the first notice provided for herein or sooner than
ten (10) days after the corporation has given notice of any material changes provided for herein; provided,
however, that such periods may be shortened upon the written consent of the holders of the Series A
Preferred Stock and Series S Preferred Stock that are entitled to such notice rights or similar notice rights
and that represent at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred Stock and Series S Preferred Stock, respectively.

DOCSOC/1236977v2/01 0218-0005
Section 4. Redemption.

(a) No Redemption of Series S Preferred Stock. The shares of Series S Preferred
Stock shall not be redeemable.

(b) Series A Preferred Stock Redemption. Shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall
be redeemed by the corporation out of funds lawfully available therefor at a price equal to the Original
Series A Issue Price, plus all declared but unpaid dividends thereon (the “Redemption Price”), in three (3)
equal annual installments commencing within twenty (20) business days following receipt by the
corporation, at any time on or after the fifth (5") anniversary of the date of filing of this Third Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, from the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding
shares of Scries A Preferred Stock, of written notice requesting redemption of all shares of Series A
Preferred Stock (the date of each such installment being referred to as a “Redemption Date”). On each
Redemption Date, the corporation shall redeem, on a pro rata basis in accordance with the number of
shares of Series A Preferred Stock determined by dividing (i) the total number of shares of Series A
Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Redemption Date by (ii) the number of remaining
Redemption Dates (including the Redemption Date to which such calculation applies). If the corporation
does not have sufficient funds legally available to redeem on any Redemption Date all shares of Series A
Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such Redemption Date, the corporation shall redeem a pro rata portion
of each holder’s redeemable shares of such Series A Preferred Stock out of funds legally available
therefor, based on the respective amounts which would otherwise be payable in respect of the shares to be
redeemed if the legally available funds were sufficient to redeem all such shares, and shall redeem the
remaining shares to have been redeemed as soon as practicable after the corporation has funds legally
available therefor.

(c) Redemption Notice. Written notice of the mandatory redemption (the
“Redemption Notice”) shall be sent to each holder of record of Series A Preferred Stock not less than ten
(10) days prior to each Redemption Date. Each Redemption Notice shall state:

(i) the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by the holder that
the corporation shall redeem on the applicable Redemption Date;

(ii) the Redemption Date and the Redemption Price;

(iii) the date upon which the holder’s right to convert such shares terminates
(which date shall be five (5) days before the applicable Redemption Date); and

(iv) that the holder is to surrender to the corporation, in the manner and at the
place designated, his, her or its certificate or certificates representing the shares of Series A Preferred
Stock to be redeemed.

(d) Surrender of Certificates: Payment. On or before the applicable Redemption
Date, each holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such Redemption Date, unless
such holder has exercised his, her or its right to convert such shares as provided in Section 5 below, shall
surrender the certificate or certificates representing such shares (or, if such registered holder alleges that
such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement reasonably
acceptable to the corporation to indemnify the corporation against any claim that may be made against the
corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate) to the corporation, in
the manner and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice, and thereupon the Redemption Price
for such shares shall be payable to the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or
certificates as the owner thereof. In the event less than all of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock

DOCSOC/1236977¥2/01 02 18-0005
represented by a certificate are redeemed, a new certificate representing the unredeemed shares of Series
A Preferred Stock shall promptly be issued to such holder.

(e) Rights Subsequent to Redemption. If the Redemption Notice shall have been
duly given, and if on the applicable Redemption Date the Redemption Price payable upon redemption of
the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such Redemption Date is paid or tendered for
payment or deposited with an independent payment agent so as to be available therefor, then
notwithstanding that the certificates evidencing any of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock so called for
redemption shall not have been surrendered, dividends with respect to such shares of Series A Preferred
Stock shall cease to accrue after such Redemption Date and all rights with respect to such shares shall
forthwith after the Redemption Date terminate, except only the right of the holders to receive the
Redemption Price without interest upon surrender of their certificate or certificates therefor.

Section 5. Conversion. The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series S Preferred
Stock shall have conversion rights as follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock and Series S Preferred
Stock shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of
such share, at the office of this corporation or any transfer agent for such stock, into such number of fully
paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Original Series A Issue
Price or the Original Series S Issue Price, as applicable, by the Conversion Price applicable to the Series
A Preferred Stock or Series S Preferred Stock, as the case may be, determined as hereafter provided, in
effect on the date the certificate is surrendered for conversion. The initial Conversion Price per share for
shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be the Original Series A Issue Price and the initial Conversion
Price per share for the shares of Series S Preferred Stock shall be the Original Series S Issue Price;
provided, however, that the Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred Stock and Series S$ Preferred
Stock shal] be subject to adjustment as set forth in subsection 5(d).

Automatic Conversion. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock and Series S
Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Price at
the time in effect for such Series A Preferred Stock and Series S Preferred Stock, as applicable,
immediately upon, except as provided below in subsection S(c), (i) the corporation’s sale of its Common
Stock in a firm commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to a registration statement on Form 8-1!
or SB-2 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the public offering price of which was not less
than $4.80 per share (as adjusted for any stock dividends, contributions or splits with respect to such
shares) and results in aggregate proceeds to the corporation of at least $30 million, or (ii) upon the
consent of not less than a majority of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series S Preferred
Stock, voting together as a single class, on an as-converted basis.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Series A Preferred Stock or
Series S Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock, he shall
surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of this corporation or of any
transfer agent for the Series A Preferred Stock or Series S Preferred Stock, as applicable, and shall give
written notice to this corporation at its principal corporate office, of the election to convert the same and
shall state therein the name or names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock
are to be issued. This corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver to such holder
of Series A Preferred Stock or Series S Preferred Stock, as appropriate, or to the nominee or nominees of
such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder
shal] be entitled as aforesaid. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to
the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Series S
Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common

6
DOCSOC/1236977v2/01 02 18-0005
Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of
such shares of Common Stock as of such date. If the conversion is in connection with an underwritten
offering of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, the conversion may, at the option
of any holder tendering Series A Preferred Stock or Series S Preferred Stock for conversion, be
conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering, in
which event the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock upon conversion of the Series A
Preferred Stock or Series S Preferred Stock, as applicable, shall not be deemed to have converted such
Series A Preferred Stock or Series S Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of
securities.

(d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Series A Preferred Stock and Series S Preferred
Stock Upon Certain Events and for Certain Dilutive Issuances, Splits and Combinations. The Conversion
Price of the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series S Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from
time to time as follows:

(i) (A) If the corporation shall issue, after the date upon which this
Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation is filed (“Effective Date”), any Additional
Stock (as defined below) without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Conversion
Price for such series in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock, the Conversion
Price for such series in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall forthwith (except as otherwise
provided in this clause (i)) be adjusted to a price (calculated to the nearest cent) determined by
multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the amount calculated in
clause (x) below and the denominator of which shall be the amount calculated in clause (y) below as
follows:

(x) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
such issue plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate
consideration received by the corporation for the total number of shares of Additional
Stock so issued would purchase at such Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to
such issuance, and

(y) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
such issue plus the number of such shares of Additional Stock so issued.

For the purpose of the above calculation, the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such issue shal] be calculated on a fully diluted basis, as if all shares of
Series A Preferred Stock and Series S Preferred Stock and all securities directly or indirectly convertible
into or exchangeable for Common Stock had been fully converted into shares of Common Stock
immediately prior to such issuance and any issued and outstanding warrants, options or other rights for
the purchase of shares of stock or convertible securities had been fully exercised immediately prior to
such issuance (and the resulting securities fully converted into shares of Common Stock, if so convertible)
as of such date, but not including in such calculation any additional shares of Common Stock issuable
with respect to shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series S Preferred Stock, convertible securities, or
outstanding options, warrants or other rights for the purchase of shares of stock or convertible securities,
solely as a result of the adjustment of the respective Conversion Price (or other conversion ratios)
resulting from the issuance of the Additional Stock causing the adjustment in question;

(B) No adjustment of the Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred
Stock and Series S Preferred Stock shall be made in an amount less than one cent per share, provided that
any adjustments which are not required to be made by reason of this sentence shall be carried forward and
shall be either taken into account in any subsequent adjustment made prior to 3 years from the date of the

DOCSOC/1236977v2/010218-0005
event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward. or shall be made at the end of 3 years from the
date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward. Except to the limited extent
provided for in subsections (E)(3) and (E)(4), no adjustment of such Conversion Price pursuant to this
subsection 5(d)(i) shall have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price above the Conversion Price in
effect immediately prior to such adjustment.

(C) In the case of the issuance of Common Stock for cash, the
consideration for such issuance shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting
any reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by this corporation for
any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

(D) _ In the case of the issuance of Common Stock for a consideration
in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration for such issuance other than cash shall be deemed to
be the fair value thereof as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors irrespective of any
accounting treatment.

(E) In the case of the issuance (whether before, on or after the first
date the Series A Preferred Stock or Series S Preferred Stock, respectively, was issued and sold or the
‘Purchase Date’’) of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common Stock, securities by their
terms convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock or options to purchase or rights to subscribe
for such convertible or exchangeable securities, the following provisions shall apply for all purposes of
this subsection 5(d)(i) and subsection 5(d)(ii):

Q) The aggregate maximum number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable upon exercise of such options to purchase or rights to
subscribe for Common Stock shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such
options or nights were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration
(determined in the manner provided in subsections 5(d)(i)(C) and 5(d)(GXD)), if any,
received by the corporation upon the issuance of such options or rights plus the minimum
exercise price provided in such options or rights for the Common Stock covered thereby.

(2) The aggregate maximum number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of or in exchange for any such convertible
or exchangeable securities or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to
subscribe for such convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or
exchange thereof shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were
issued or such options or rights were issued and for a consideration equal to the
consideration, if any, received by the corporation for any such securities and related
options or rights (excluding any cash received on account of accrued interest or accrued
dividends), plus the minimum additional consideration, if any, to be received by the
corporation upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or the exercise of any
related options or rights (the consideration in each case to be determined in the manner
provided in subsections 5(d)(i)(C) and 5(d)(i)(D)).

(3) In the event of any change in the number of
shares of Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to this corporation
upon exercise of such options or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such
convertible or exchangeable securities, including, but not limited to, a change resulting
from the antidilution provisions thereof (except for changes resulting from the application
of this Section 5 to the Conversion Price of the Series A Preferred Stock or Series S
Preferred Stock, as applicable), the Conversion Price of the Series A Preferred Stock and

DOCSOC/1 236977¥2/010218-0005
the Series S Preferred Stock, as applicable, to the extent in any way affected by or
computed using such options, rights or securities, shall be recomputed to reflect such
change, but no further adjustment shall be made for the actual issuance of Common Stock
or any payment of such consideration upon the exercise of any such options or rights or
the conversion or exchange of such securities.

(4) Upon the expiration of any such options or
rights, the termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any
options or rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Conversion
Price of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series S Preferred Stock, as applicable, to the
extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, rights or securities or
options or rights related to such securities, shall be recomputed to reflect the issuance of
only the number of shares of Common Stock (and convertible or exchangeable securities
which remain in effect) actually issued upon the exercise of such options or rights, upon
the conversion or exchange of such securities or upon the exercise of the options or rights
related to such securities.

(5) The number of shares of Common Stock deemed
issued and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to subsections 5(d){i)(E)(1)
and (2) shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or expiration of
the type described in either subsection 5(d)(i)(E)(3) or (4).

(ii) “Additional Stock” shall mean any shares of Common Stock issued (or
deemed to have been issued pursuant to subsection 5(d)(i)(E)) by this corporation after the Purchase Date
other than:

(A) | Common Stock issued pursuant to a transaction described in subsection
5(d)(iii) hereof, and

(B) Up to 1,000,000 Shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to the
exercise of stock options granted or restricted stock purchases offered under a stock incentive plan
approved by the stockholders and Board of Directors (including by each of the Series A Director and
Series S Director).

(iii) In the event the corporation should at any time or from time to time after
the Purchase Date fix a record date for the effectuation of a split or subdivision of the outstanding shares
of Common Stock or the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive a dividend or
other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock or other securities or rights convertible
into, or entitling the holder thereof to receive directly or indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock
(hereinafter referred to as “Common Stock Equivalents”) without payment of any consideration by such
holder for the additional shares of Common Stock or the Common Stock Equivalents (including the
additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof), then, as of such record
date (or the date of such dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no record date is fixed), the
Conversion Price of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series S Preferred Stock, as applicable, shall be
appropriately decreased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each
share of such series shal] be increased in proportion to such increase of the aggregate number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding (after taking account of such increase in shares issuable upon conversion of
the Series A Preferred Stock and Series S Preferred Stock) and those issuable with respect to such
Common Stock Equivalents with the number of shares issuable with respect to Common Stock
Equivalents determined from time to time in the manner provided for deemed issuances in subsection

5(d)(i)(E).

DOCSOC/1236977¥2/0102 18-0005
(iv) If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any time after
the Purchase Date is decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, then,
following the record date of such combination, the Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred Stock and
Series S Preferred Stock, as applicable, shall be appropriately increased-so that the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be decreased in proportion to
such decrease in outstanding shares.

(e) Other Distributions. In the event this corporation shall declare a distribution
payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by this corporation or other
persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred to in subsection 5(d)(iv), then,
in each such case for the purpose of this subsection 5(e), the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and
Series $ Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any such distribution as though they
were the holders of the number of shares of Common Stock of the corporation into which their shares of
Series A Preferred Stock and Series S Preferred Stock, respectively, are convertible as of the record date
fixed for the determination of the holders of Common Stock of the corporation entitled to receive such
distribution.

(f) Recapitalizations. If at any time or from time to time there shall be a
recapitalization of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision, combination or merger or sale of assets
transaction provided for elsewhere in this Section 5 or Section 3) provision shall be made so that the
holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series S Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive
upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock or Series S Preferred Stock, as applicable, the number of
shares of stock or other securities or property of this corporation or otherwise, to which a holder of
Common Stock deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled on such recapitalization. In any
such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 5 with
respect to the rights of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series S Preferred Stock after the
recapitalization to the end that the provisions of this Section 5 (including adjustment of the Conversion
Price then in effect and the number of shares purchasable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock
and Series S Preferred Stock, respectively) shall be applicable after that event as nearly equivalent as may
be practicable.

(g) No Impairment. This corporation will not, by amendment of its Certificate of
Incorporation or through any reorganization, recapitalization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger,
