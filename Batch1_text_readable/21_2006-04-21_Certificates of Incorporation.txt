3. Redemption

Neither this Corporation nor the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock has the

4, Conversion

The holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock will have conversion rights as follows
(the Conversion Rights ):

{a) Right to Convert. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock (the

Convertible Preferred Stock ) is convertible, at the option of the holder thereof and without
payment of any additional consideration, at any time after the date of issuance of such share at
the office of this Corporation or any transfer agent for such stock, into such number of fully paid
and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the applicable Original
Issue Price per share (as defined below) for each such series of Convertible Preferred Stock by
the conversion price applicable to such share, determined as hereafter provided, in effect on the
date the certificate is surrendered for conversion (the Conversion Price ). The Original Issue
Price price for the Series A Preferred Stock is $1.00 per share (subject to adjustment for
Recapitalizations). The initial Conversion Price per share for shares of Series A Preferred Stock
is $1.00 (subject to adjustment for Recapitalizations) (the Series A Conversion Price ). The
Series A Conversion Price will be subject to adjustment as set forth in Section IV(B)(4)(d).

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock will
automatically and without further action on the part of this Corporation or any holder of such
series of Preferred Stock be converted into shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Price at
the time then in effect for such series of Preferred Stock immediately upon the earlier of (i)
except as provided in Section IV(B)(4)(c), this Corporation s sale of its Common Stock in a firm
commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Act ), the public offering price of which is not less
than $4.00 per share (subject to adjustment for Recapitalizations) and $25,000,000 in the
aggregate (other than a registration statement relating either to the sale of securities to employees
of this Corporation pursuant to its stock option, stock purchase or similar plan or a transaction
pursuant to Rule 145 under the Act), which results in the Common Stock being listed for trading

on a national securities exchange or the Nasdaq National Market (a Qualifying IPO ) or (ii) the
date specified by written consent or agreement of the holders of at least at least sixty percent
(60%) of the then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Convertible Preferred
Stock will be entitied to convert the same into shares of Common Stock, he, she or it must
(i) surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of this
Corporation or of any transfer agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock, (ii) give written notice
to this Corporation at its principal corporate office, of the election to convert the same and
(iii) state therein the name or names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common
Stock are to be issued. This Corporation will, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver
at such office to such holder of Convertible Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or nominees of
such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled as aforesaid. Such conversion will be deemed to have been made immediately
prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Convertible Preferred
Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion will be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of
such shares of Common Stock as of such date. If the conversion is in connection with an
underwritten offering of securities registered pursuant to the Act, the conversion may, at the
option of any holder tendering shares of Convertible Preferred Stock for conversion, be
conditioned upon the closing with the underwritcrs of the sale of securities pursuant to such
offering, in which event the persons entitled to receive the Common Stock upon conversion of
the Convertible Preferred Stock will not be deemed to have converted such Convertible Preferred
Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities. If the conversion is in
connection with Automatic Conversion provisions of subsection 4(b)Gi) above, such conversion
shall be deemed to have been made on the conversion date described in the stockholder consent
approving such conversion, and the persons entitled to receive shares of Common Stock issuable
upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holders of such shares of
Common Stock as of such date.

(d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock. The Conversion Price
of the Series A Preferred Stock will be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

(i) (A) _ If this Corporation issues, after the date upon which any
shares of Series A Preferred Stock were first issued (the Purchase Date ), any Additional Stock
(as defined below) without consideration or for a consideration per share Icss than the Series A
Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock, the Series
A Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall forthwith (except as
otherwise provided in this Section IV(B)(4)(d)(i)) be adjusted to a price determined by
multiplying such Series A Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding plus the number of shares of Common Stock
deemed issued pursuant to Section IV(B)(4)(d)(i)(E) immediately prior to such issuance plus the
number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received by this
Corporation for such issuance would purchase at such Serics A Conversion Price; and the
denominator of which shal] be the numbcr of shares of Common Stock outstanding plus the
number of shares of Common Stock deemed issued pursuant to Section IV(B)(4)(d)(i)(B)
immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock.
(A) [Intentionally omitted.]

{(B) No adjustment of the Conversion Price for any series of
Convertible Preferred Stock will be made in an amount less than one cent per share, provided
that any adjustments that are not required to be made by reason of this sentence will be carried
forward and shall be either taken into account in any subsequent adjustment made prior to
three (3) years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward, or
will be made at the end of three (3) years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment
being carried forward. Except to the limited cxtent provided for in Sections IV(B)(4)(d)@)(E)GC)
and IV(B)(4)(d)(i)(E)(4), no adjustment of such Conversion Price pursuant to this Section
IV(B)(4)(d)(i) shall have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price above the Conversion
Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment.

(C) ‘In the case of the issuance of Common Stock for cash, the
consideration will be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting any
reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by this
Corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

(D) In the case of the issuance of the Common Stock for a
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash will be
deemed to be the fair value thereof as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors
irrespective of any accounting treatment.

applicable Purchase Date) of warrants, options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common
Stock, securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock or warrants,

of Common Stock or any payment of such consideration upon the exercise of any such options or
rights or the conversion or exchange of such securities.

(4) Upon the expiration of any such options or rights,
the termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options or
rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Conversion Price of each series

distribution, split or subdivision if no record date is fixed), the Conversion Price of each series of
Convertible Preferred Stock will be appropriately decreased so that the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series will be increased in

Section IV(B)(4)(d)Gi), then, in each such case for the purpose of this Section IV(B)(4)(e), the
holders of each series of Convertible Preferred Stock will be entitled to a proportionate share of
any such distribution as though they were the holders of the number of shares of Common Stock

this Corporation entitled to receive such distribution.

adjustment will be made in the application of the provisions of this Section IV(B)(4) with respect
to the rights of the holders of each series of Convertible Preferred Stock after the capital
reorganization such that the provisions of this Section IV(B)(4) (including adjustment of the

Convertible Preferred Stock the holder is at the time converting into Common Stock and the
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such aggregate conversion.

Conversion Price of any series of Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section IV(B)(4),
