L. Dividend Provisions.

(a) The holders of shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to receive dividends, out of any assets legally available therefor, prior and in preference
to any declaration or payment of any dividend or distribution (payable other than in Common
Stock or other securities and rights convertible into or entitling the holder thereof to receive,
directly or indirectly, shares of Common Stock of the Company) on the Series B-2 Preferred
Stock, Series B-1 Preferred Stock, Series A-2 Preferred Stock or the Common Stock or any other
junior equity security of the Company, at the rate of eight percent (8%) of the Original Series A-
1 Issue Price (as defined below) per share per annum; provided, however, that this restriction
shall not apply to repurchases of capital stock of the Company made in accordance with Section
6. Such dividends shall be cumulative, shall be compounded annually and shall accrue on each
such share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock from the respective original date of issue of such share
based on a three hundred sixty-five (365) day year, whether or not earned or declared, but shall
be payable only when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors. The holders of the
outstanding Series A-1 Preferred Stock can waive any dividend preference that such holders
shall be entitled to receive under this Section 1 upon the affirmative vote or written consent of
the holders of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock then outstanding.

(b) After payment of such dividends to the holders of the Series A-1
Preferred Stock as provided in subsection l(a) above, any additional dividends or distributions
shall be distributed among all holders of Common Stock and Preferred Stock in proportion to the
number of shares of Common Stock that would be held by each such holder if all shares of
Preferred Stock were converted to Common Stock at the then effective Conversion Ratio.

(c) The Company shall not make any distribution of securities of other
persons, cash or other property without consideration, whether by way of dividend or otherwise,
to the holders of Common Stock except in accordance with this Section 1.

Stock and Common Stock or other junior equity security of the Company by reason of their
ownership thereof, an amount per share equal to the Original Series B-2 Issue Price (as defined
below), plus ail declared but unpaid dividends on such share. If upon the occurrence of such
event, the assets and funds thus distributed among the holders of the Series B-2 Preferred Stock

ACTIVE/92701222,2 2
shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full aforesaid preferential
amount, then the entire assets and funds of the Company legally available for distribution shall
be distributed ratably among the holders of the Series B-2 Preferred Stock in proportion to the
full preferential amount that each such holder is otherwise entitled to receive under this
subsection (a). “Original Series B-2 Issue Price” shall mean $0.3524 per share for each share of
the Series B-2 Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any dividends, combinations, splits,
recapitalizations and the like after the filing date hereof).

the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, either voluntary or
involuntary, the holders of the Series B-1 Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, prior and in
preference to any distribution of any of the assets of the Company to the holders of the Series A-
1 Preferred Stock, Series A-2 Preferred Stock and Common Stock or other junior equity security
of the Company by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount per share equal to the Original
Series B-1 Issue Price (as defined below), plus all declared but unpaid dividends on such share.
If upon the occurrence of such event, the assets and funds thus distributed among the holders of
the Series B-1 Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the
full aforesaid preferential amount, then the entire assets and funds of the Company legally
available for distribution shall be distributed ratably among the holders of the Series B-1
Preferred Stock in proportion to the full preferential amount that each such holder is otherwise
entitled to receive under this subsection (a). “Original Series B-1 Issue Price” shall mean
$0.5496 per share for each share of the Series B-1 Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any dividends,
combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like after the filing date hereof).

(c) Upon completion of the distributions required by Sections 2(a) and
2(b), in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, either voluntary
or involuntary, the holders of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, prior
and in preference to any distribution of any of the assets of the Company to the holders of the
Series A-2 Preferred Stock and Common Stock or other junior equity security of the Company
by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount per share equal to one and one-half (1 1/2) times
the Original Series A-1 Issue Price (as defined below) plus all dividends accrued but unpaid
thereon, whether or not declared, together with any other dividends declared but unpaid thereon.
If upon the occurrence of such event, the assets and funds thus distributed among the holders of
the Series A-1 Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the
full aforesaid preferential amount, then the entire assets and funds of the Company legally
available for distribution shall be distributed ratably among the holders of the Series A-1
Preferred Stock in proportion to the full preferential amount that each such holder is otherwise
entitled to receive under this subsection (b). “Original Series A-1 Issue Price” shall mean
$0.137146 per share for each share of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any
dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like after the filing date hereof).

(d) | Upon the completion of the distributions required by Sections 2(a)
through 2(c), in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, either
voluntary or involuntary, the holders of the Series A-2 Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
receive, prior and in preference to any distribution of any of the assets of the Company to the
holders of the Common Stock or other junior equity security of the Company by reason of their
ownership thereof, an amount per share equal to $1.3068 for each outstanding share of Series A-

ACTIVE/92701222,2 3
2 Preferred Stock (the “Original Series A-2 Issue Price”), plus all declared but unpaid dividends
on such share. If upon the occurrence of such event, the assets and funds thus distributed among
the holders of the Series A-2 Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such
holders of the full aforesaid preferential amount, then the entire assets and funds of the Company
legally available for distribution shall be distributed ratably among the holders of the Series A-2
Preferred Stock in proportion to the full preferential amount that each such holder is otherwise
entitled to receive under this subsection (c).

(e) Upon the completion of the distributions required by Sections 2(a)
through 2(d), the entire remaining assets and funds of the Company legally available for
distribution, if any, shall be distributed among the holders of the Series B-2 Preferred Stock,
Series A-1 Preferred Stock, the Series A-2 Preferred Stock and the Common Stock pro rata based
on the number of shares of Common Stock held by each (on an as-converted basis with respect
to the Preferred Stock).

(f)

(i) For purposes of this Section 2, a liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Company shall be deemed to be occasioned by, or to include, (A) the
acquisition of the Company by another entity by means of any transaction or series of related
transactions (including, without limitation, any reorganization, merger or consolidation but,
excluding any merger effected exclusively for the purpose of changing the domicile of the
Company); (B) a sale or lease of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; unless the
Company’s stockholders of record as constituted immediately prior to such Acquisition (as
defined below) will, immediately after such Acquisition (by virtue of securities issued as
consideration for the Acquisition or otherwise) hold at least 50% of the voting power of the
surviving or acquiring entity; or (C) an exclusive licensing of all or substantially all of the
Company’s intellectual property to a third party (any such acquisition, sale or licensing described
in clause (A), (B) or (C), an “Acquisition”). In such event, and subject to subsection 2(g) below,
the holders of Preferred Stock and Common Stock shall be entitled to receive at the closing of
such Acquisition in cash, securities or other property amounts as specified in subsections 2(a)
through 2(e).

(ii) ‘In any of such events, if the consideration received by the
Company is other than cash, its value will be deemed its fair market value. Any securities shall
be valued as follows:

{A) Securities not subject to investment letter or other
similar restrictions on free marketability:

(1) If traded on a U.S. securities exchange, the
value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange
over the 20-day period ending two (2) days prior to the closing of such liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Company;

ACTIVE/92701222,2 4
(2) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value
shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid prices over the 20-day period ending two
days prior to the closing of such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company; and

(3) If there is no active public market, the value
shall be the fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Company and the holders of
at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock.

(B) The method of valuation of securities
subject to investment letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than
restrictions arising solely by virtue of a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former
affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount, if any, from the market value
determined as set forth above in Section 2(f)(ii)(A) (1), (2) or (3) to reflect the
approximate fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Company and the
holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock.

(iii) ‘In the event the requirements of this subsection 2(f) are not
complied with, the Company shall forthwith either:

(A) _ cause such closing to be postponed until such time
as the requirements of this Section 2 have been complied with; or

(B) cancel such transaction, in which event the rights,
preferences and privileges of the holders of the Preferred Stock shall revert to and be the
same as such rights, preferences and privileges existing immediately prior to the date of
the first notice referred to in subsection 2(f)(iv) hereof.

(iv) The Company shall give each holder of record of Preferred
Stock written notice of such impending transaction not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the
stockholders’ meeting called to approve such transaction, or fifteen (15) days prior to the closing
of such transaction, whichever is earlier, and shall also notify such holders in writing of the final
approval of such transaction, The first of such notices shall describe the material terms and
conditions of the impending transaction and the provisions of this Section 2, and the Company
shall thereafter give such holders prompt notice of any material changes. The transaction shall in
no event take place sooner than fifteen (15) days after the Company has given the first notice
provided for herein or sooner than five (5) days after the Company has given notice of any
material changes provided for herein. In connection with any proposed Acquisition transaction,
holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to conditionally convert their shares of Preferred
Stock into such number of shares of Common Stock as provided in Section B.4 of this Article IV
contingent upon the consummation of the Acquisition; it being the intent of this Section that
holders of Preferred Stock be given the opportunity to maximize the return on their investment in
the event that they convert their shares of Preferred Stock into Common Stock and not to require
the holders of Preferred Stock to convert if, for any reason, the Acquisition provided for in the
notice to the holders of Preferred Stock is not consummated.

ACTIVE/92701222,2 5
(v) Shares of Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to be
converted into shares of Common Stock in order to participate in any distribution, or series of
distributions, as shares of Common Stock, without first foregoing participation in the
distribution, or series of distributions, as shares of Preferred Stock.

{g) In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Company, including any Acquisition, if any portion of the consideration payable to the
stockholders of the Company or to the Company is payable only upon satisfaction of
contingencies (the “Additional Consideration”), then (i) the portion of such consideration that is
not Additional Consideration (such portion, the “Initial Consideration”) shall be allocated among
the holders of capital stock of the Corporation in accordance with subsections 2(a) through 2(e)
above as if the Initial Consideration were the only consideration payable in connection with such
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company; and (ii) any Additional Consideration
which becomes payable to the stockholders of the Company or to the Company upon
satisfaction of such contingencies shall be allocated among the holders of capital stock of the
corporation in accordance with subsections 2(a) through 2(e) after taking into account the
previous payment of the Initial Consideration as part of the same transaction and recalculating
whether any conversion of Series B-1 Preferred Stock to Common Stock, as provided in
subsection 2(a) above, would have been economically rational based upon the aggregate amount
of the Initial Consideration plus all Additional Consideration which actually gets distributed to
the holders of Series B-1 Preferred Stock upon release from escrow or satisfaction of such
contingencies. For the purposes of this subsection 2(g), consideration placed into escrow or
retained as holdback to be available for satisfaction of indemnification or similar obligations in
connection with such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, or payments to be
made upon the achievement of certain milestones, are examples of and shall be deemed to be
Additional Consideration.

3. Redemption. The Preferred Stock is not redeemable at the option of the
holder thereof.

4, Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion
rights as follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be
convertible at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such
share, at the office of the Company or any transfer agent for such stock, into such number of
fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Original
Series B-2 Issue Price, Original Series B-1 Issue Price, Original Series A-1 Issue Price or
Original Series A-2 Issue Price by the conversion price applicable to the Series B-2 Preferred
Stock, Series B-1 Preferred Stock, Series A-1 Preferred Stock or Series A-2 Preferred Stock, as
the case may be (in each case, the “Conversion Price”). The ratio obtained by dividing the
original issue price of a series or class of stock by the conversion price then in effect for such
series or class of stock is referred to herein as the “Conversion Ratio”. The initial Conversion
Price per share for the shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock shall be the Original Series B-2 Issue
Price, the initial Conversion Price per share for the shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock shall be
the Original Series B-1 Issue Price, the initial Conversion Price per share for shares of Series A-1
Preferred Stock shall be the Original Series A-1 Issue Price, and the initial Conversion Price per

ACTIVE/92701222,2 6
share for shares of Series A-2 Preferred Stock shall be the Original Series A-2 Issue Price;
provided, however, that these Conversion Prices shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in
subsection 4(d).

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall
automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock, at the Conversion Ratio then in effect
for each such series of Preferred Stock, immediately upon the earlier of (i) except as provided
below in subsection 4(c), the closing of the sale by the Company of Common Stock in a firm
commitment underwritten public offering registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the “Securities Act”), other than a registration relating solely to a transaction under
Rule 145 under the Securities Act (or any successor thereto) or to an employee benefit plan of
the Company, that results in gross offering proceeds (before deduction of underwriters’ discounts
and commissions and expenses) to the Company and/or any selling stockholders of more than
$25,000,000 in the aggregate and a per share public offering price of at least $2.1984 (subject to
adjustment to reflect subsequent stock dividends, stock splits, stock combinations or other
recapitalizations) (a “Qualified Public Offering”) or (ii) the date specified by written consent or
agreement of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (voting
together as a single class and not as separate series and on an as-converted basis).

(c) Mechanics of Conversion.

(i) Before any holder of a series of Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the
certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Company or of any transfer
agent for such series of Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the Company at its
principal corporate office, of the election to convert the same and shall state therein the name or
names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued;
provided, however, that in the event of an automatic conversion pursuant to subsection 4(b), the
outstanding shares of such series of Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically without any
further action by the holder of such shares and whether or not the certificate representing such
shares is surrendered to the Company or its transfer agent; provided, further, however, that the
Company shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon such automatic conversion unless either the certificates evidencing such shares of
Preferred Stock are delivered to the Company or its transfer agent as provided above, or the
holder notifies the Company or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or
destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Company to indemnify the Company
from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates. The Company shall, as soon as
practicable after the surrender by a holder of the certificate representing shares of the Preferred
Stock in accordance with this subsection 4(c), issue and deliver at such office to such holder of
such series of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or
certificates, for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as
aforesaid. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of
business on the date of such surrender of the shares of such series of Preferred Stock to be
converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable
upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such
shares of Common Stock as of such date.

ACTIVE/92701222,2 7
(ii) If the conversion is in connection with an underwritten
offering of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act, the conversion may, at the option
of any holder tendering shares of such series of Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned
upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering, in
which event the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion
of such series of Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such shares of such
series of Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities.

(ii) ‘If the conversion occurs through the vote of the holders of
Preferred Stock pursuant to subsection 4(b), such conversion shall be deemed to have been made
at the close of business on the day written notice of such election has been received by the
Company, and the person or persons entitled to receive shares of Common Stock issuable upon
such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of
Common Stock on such date. Until certificates for such shares of Preferred Stock of the
applicable classes that have been converted have been delivered to the Company for exchange
for certificates representing shares of Common Stock, such certificates shall be deemed to
represent the shares of Common Stock into which such shares of the applicable classes of
Preferred Stock have been converted.

(d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock for Certain
Dilutive Issuances, Splits and Combinations. The Conversion Price of the Series B-2 Preferred
Stock, the Series B-1 Preferred Stock and the Series A-1 Preferred Stock shall be subject to
adjustment from time to time as follows:

(i)

(A) Ifthe Company shall issue, on or after the date upon
which this Restated Certificate of Incorporation is accepted for filing by the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware (the “Filing Date”), any Additional Stock (as defined
below) without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Conversion
Price for the Series B-2 Preferred Stock, the Series B-1 Preferred Stock or the Series A-1
Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock (as
defined below), the Conversion Price for the Series B-2 Preferred Stock, Series B-1
Preferred Stock or Series A-1 Preferred Stock, as applicable, in effect immediately prior
to each such issuance shall forthwith (except as otherwise provided in this clause (i)) be
adjusted to a price determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the
numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the
aggregate consideration received by the Company for such issuance would purchase at
such Conversion Price; and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares
of such Additional Stock. For the purpose of the foregoing calculation, the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance shall be
calculated on a fully diluted basis, as if all shares of Preferred Stock and all other
securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock (“Convertible Securities”)
had been fully converted into shares of Common Stock immediately prior to such
issuance and any currently exercisable warrants, options or other rights for the purchase

ACTIVE/92701222,2 8
of shares of stock or convertible securities had been fully exercised immediately prior to
such issuance (and the resulting securities fully converted into shares of Common Stock,
if so convertible), but not including in such calculation any additional shares of Common
Stock issuable with respect to shares of Preferred Stock, Convertible Securities, or
currently exercisable options, warrants or other rights for the purchase of shares of stock
or Convertible Securities, solely as a result of the adjustment of such Conversion Price
for the Series B-2 Preferred Stock, the Series B-1 Preferred Stock or the Series A-1
Preferred Stock (or other conversion ratios) resulting from the issuance of Additional
Stock causing such adjustment.

(B) No adjustment of the Conversion Price for the
Series B-2 Preferred Stock, the Series B-1 Preferred Stock or the Series A-1 Preferred
Stock shall be made in an amount less than one hundredth of a cent per share, provided
that any adjustments which are not required to be made by reason of this sentence shall
be carried forward and shail be either taken into account in any subsequent adjustment
made prior to three years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being
carried forward, or shall be made at the end of three years from the date of the event
giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward. Except to the limited extent provided
for in subsections 4(d)(i)(E)(3) and 4(d)(i)(E)(4) below, no adjustment of the Conversion
Price for the Series B-2 Preferred Stock, the Series B-1 Preferred Stock or the Series A-1
Preferred Stock pursuant to this subsection 4(d)(i) shall have the effect of increasing the
Conversion Price for the Series B-2 Preferred Stock, the Series B-1 Preferred Stock or the
Series A-1 Preferred Stock above the Conversion Price for the Series B-2 Preferred
Stock, the Series B-1 Preferred Stock or the Series A-1 Preferred Stock in effect
immediately prior to such adjustment.

(C) In the case of the issuance of Common Stock for
cash, the consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before
deducting any reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or
incurred by the Company for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the
issuance and sale thereof.

(D) Inthe case of the issuance of the Common Stock for
a consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall
be deemed to be the fair value thereof as determined by the Board of Directors
irrespective of any accounting treatment.

(E) In the case of the issuance (whether before, on or
after the Filing Date) of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common Stock,
Convertible Securities, or options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Convertible
Securities, the following provisions shall apply for all purposes of this subsection 4(d)(i)
and subsection 4(d)(ii):

(1) The aggregate maximum number of shares
of Common Stock deliverable upon exercise (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to
exercisability, including without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account
potential antidilution adjustments) of such options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common

ACTIVE/92701222,2 9
Stock shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such options or rights were issued and for
a consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in subsections
4(d)G)(C) and 4(d)(i)(D)), if any, received by the Company upon the issuance of such options or
rights plus the minimum exercise price provided in such options or rights (without taking into
account potential antidilution adjustments) for the Common Stock covered thereby.

(2) The aggregate maximum number of shares
of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of or in exchange (assuming the satisfaction of
any conditions to convertibility or exchangeability, including, without limitation, the passage of
time, but without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) for any such Convertible
Securities or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such Convertible
Securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof shall be deemed to have been issued at
the time such securities were issued or such options or rights were issued and for a consideration
equal to the consideration, if any, received by the Company for any such securities and related
options or rights (excluding any cash received on account of accrued interest or accrued
dividends), plus the minimum additional consideration, if any, to be received by the Company
(without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) upon the conversion or exchange
of such securities or the exercise of any related options or rights (the consideration in each case
to be determined in the manner provided in subsections 4(d)()(C) and 4(d)G)(D)).

(3) In the event of any change in the number of
shares of Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to the Company upon
exercise of such options or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such Convertible
Securities, including, but not limited to, a change resulting from the antidilution provisions
thereof, the Conversion Price for the Series B-2 Preferred Stock, the Series B-1 Preferred Stock
or the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such
options, rights or securities, shall be recomputed to reflect such change, but no further
adjustment shall be made for the actual issuance of Common Stock or any payment of such
consideration upon the exercise of any such options or rights or the conversion or exchange of
such securities; provided, however, that this subsection shall not have any effect on any
conversion of such series of Preferred Stock that occurred prior to such change or increase.

(4) Upon the expiration of any such options or
rights, the termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options
or rights related to such Convertible Securities, the Conversion Price for the Series B-2 Preferred
Stock, the Series B-1 Preferred Stock or the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way
affected by or computed using such options, rights or securities or options or rights related to
such securities, shall be recomputed to reflect the issuance of only the number of shares of
Common Stock (and convertible or exchangeable securities that remain in effect) actually issued
upon the exercise of such options or rights, upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or
upon the exercise of the options or rights related to such securities; provided, however, that this
subsection shall not have any effect on any conversion of such series of Preferred Stock that
occurred prior to such change or increase.

(5) The number of shares of Common Stock
deemed issued and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to subsections 4(d)(i)(E)()

ACTIVE/92701222,2 10
and 4(d)(i)(E)(2) shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or expiration
of the type described in either subsection 4(d)(i)(E)(3) or 4(d)()(E)(4).

(ii) “Additional Stock” shall mean any shares of Common
Stock issued (or deemed to have been issued pursuant to subsection 4(d)(i)(E)) by the Company
after the Filing Date other than:

(A) Common Stock issued pursuant to a transaction
described in subsection 4(d)(iii) hereof,

(B) shares of Common Stock issuable or issued to
directors, officers, or employees of, or consultants, or other service providers to the
Company directly or pursuant to a stock option, stock bonus, stock purchase or restricted
stock plan or agreement or warrants approved by the Board of Directors of the Company;

(C) Common Stock issued or issuable upon conversion
of the Preferred Stock and other currently outstanding convertible securities, including

(D) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable in
connection with a bona fide business acquisition of or by the Company, whether by
merger, consolidation, sale of assets, sale or exchange of stock or otherwise;

(E) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable in
connection with the following transactions and upon approval by the Board of Directors,
in each case, including a majority of the Preferred Directors, (1) a strategic licensing
transaction; or (2) a corporate partnership or joint venture or similar strategic agreement
or transaction; provided, in any issuance pursuant to this subsection 4(d)(1i)(E), such
issuance is for other than primarily equity financing purposes;

(F) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable to
banks, equipment lessors and other financial institutions or landlords in connection with
the extension of credit to the Company (including loans, lines of credit, guarantees or
other financing arrangements) or in connection with the lease of equipment, personal
property or real property, provided such issuances are for other than primarily equity
financing purposes and are approved by the Board of Directors of the Company;

(G) — shares of Common Stock issued or issuable as a
dividend or distribution on the Preferred Stock;

(H) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable upon
approval of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series B-2 Preferred Stock, the
Series B-1 Preferred Stock and the Series A-1 Preferred Stock (voting together as a single
class and not as a separate series on an as-converted basis); and

(I) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable (1) in a
public offering before or in connection with which all outstanding shares of Preferred

ACTIVE/92701222,2 11
Stock will be converted to Common Stock or (2) upon exercise of warrants or rights
granted to underwriters in connection with such a public offering.

(iii) In the event the Company should at any time or from time
to time after the Filing Date fix a record date for the effectuation of a split or subdivision of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock or the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled
to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock or other
securities or rights convertible into, or entitling the holder thereof to receive directly or
indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock (hereinafter referred to as “Common Stock
Equivalents”) without a corresponding subdivision, dividend or other distribution to holders of
Preferred Stock and without payment of any consideration by such holder for the additional
shares of Common Stock or the Common Stock Equivalents (including the additional shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof), then, as of such record date (or the
date of such dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no record date is fixed), the Conversion
Price of each series of Preferred Stock shall be appropriately decreased so that the number of
shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be increased
in proportion to such increase of the aggregate of shares of Common Stock outstanding and those
issuable with respect to such Common Stock Equivalents with the number of shares issuable
with respect to Common Stock Equivalents determined from time to time in the manner provided
for deemed issuance, in subsection 4(d)(i)(E).

(iv) If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at
any time after the Filing Date is decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock and without a corresponding combination of the outstanding shares of Preferred
Stock, then, following the record date of such combination, the Conversion Price for each series
of Preferred Stock shall be appropriately increased so that the number of shares of Common
Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be decreased in proportion to such
decrease in outstanding shares.

(v) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
operation of, and any adjustment of the Conversion Prices pursuant to, the provisions of
subsection 4(d)(i) may be waived with respect to the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, either
prospectively or retroactively and either generally or in a particular instance by a writing
executed by the holders of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock then
outstanding. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the operation of, and any
adjustment of the Conversion Prices pursuant to, the provisions of subsection 4(d)(i) may be
waived with respect to the Series B-1 Preferred Stock, either prospectively or retroactively and
either generally or in a particular instance by a writing executed by the holders of a majority of
the Series B-1 Preferred Stock then outstanding. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the operation of, and any adjustment of the Conversion Prices pursuant to, the
provisions of subsection 4(d)(i) may be waived with respect to the Series B-2 Preferred Stock,
either prospectively or retroactively and either generally or in a particular instance by a writing
executed by the holders of a majority of the Series B-2 Preferred Stock then outstanding. Any
waiver pursuant to this subsection 4(d)(v) shall bind all future holders of the shares of Preferred
Stock for which rights have been waived. In the event that a waiver of adjustment of Conversion
Price under this subsection 4(d)(v) results in different Conversion Prices for shares of a series of
Preferred Stock, the Secretary of this company shall maintain a written ledger identifying the

ACTIVE/92701222,2 12
Conversion Price for each share of such series of Preferred Stock. Such information shall be
made available to any person upon request.

(e) Other Distributions. In the event the Company shall declare a
distribution payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by the
Company or other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred to
in subsection 4(d)(iii), without a corresponding distribution to the Preferred Stock, then, in each
such case for the purpose of this subsection 4(e), the holders of the Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to a proportionate share of any such distribution as though they were the holders of the
number of shares of Common Stock into which their shares of Preferred Stock are convertible as
of the record date fixed for the determination of the holders of Common Stock entitled to receive
such distribution,

(f) Recapitalizations and Reorganizations.

(i) If at any time or from time to time there shall be a
recapitalization or reorganization of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision, combination
or merger or sale of assets transaction provided for elsewhere in this subsection 4 or
subsection 2) provision shall be made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock shall thereafter
be entitled to receive, upon conversion thereof, the number of shares of stock or other securities
or property of the Company or otherwise, to which a holder of Common Stock deliverable upon
conversion would have been entitled on such recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate
adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this subsection 4 with respect to
the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock after the recapitalization or reorganization to the
end that the provisions of this subsection 4 (including adjustment of the Conversion Price then in
effect and the number of shares purchasable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be
applicable after that event as nearly equivalent as may be practicable.

Gi) If any consolidation or merger of the Company with
another company or entity shall be effected, then, as a condition of such consolidation or merger,
lawful and adequate provision shall be made whereby the holders of the Preferred Stock shall
thereafter have the right to receive, upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified
herein, and in lieu of the shares of Common Stock immediately theretofore receivable upon the
conversion of the Preferred Stock, such shares of stock, securities or assets as may be issued or
payable in connection with such consolidation or merger with respect to or in exchange for a
number of outstanding shares of Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock immediately prior to such consolidation or
merger. In any such case, appropriate provision shall be made with respect to the rights and
interests of the holders of the Preferred Stock to the end that the provisions hereof (including,
without limitation, provisions for adjustment of each applicable Conversion Price) shall
thereafter be applicable, as nearly as may be practicable, in relation to any shares of stock,
securities or assets thereafter deliverable upon the exercise of such conversion rights. Except as
expressly set forth in this subsection (11), nothing in this subsection 4(f)(i1) will be deemed to
restrict the Company from entering into a consolidation or merger.

(g) [Reserved]

ACTIVE/92701222,2 13
(h) No Fractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments.

(i) No fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of
any share or shares of the Preferred Stock, and the number of shares of Common Stock to be
issued shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share and the Company shall pay in cash the
fair market value of any fractional shares as of the time when entitlement to receive such
fractions is determined. Whether or not fractional shares are issuable upon such conversion shall
be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock the holder is at the
time converting into Common Stock and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
such aggregate conversion.

(i) Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of
the Conversion Price of Preferred Stock pursuant to this subsection 4, the Company, at its
expense, shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms
hereof and prepare and furnish to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such
adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or
readjustment is based. The Company shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of
Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth
(A) such adjustment and readjustment, (B) the consideration received or deemed to be received
by the Company for any Additional Stock issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold,
(C) the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock at the time in effect, and (D) the
number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time
would be received upon the conversion of a share of Preferred Stock.

(i) Notices of Record Date. In the event of any taking by the
Company of a record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the
holders thereof who are entitled to recetve any dividend (other than a cash dividend) or other
distribution, any right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of stock of any
class or any other securities or property, to receive any other right, or to exchange their shares of
Common Stock, Preferred Stock (or other securities) for securities or other property deliverable
upon a reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, dissolution, liquidation or winding
up, the Company shall mail to each holder of Preferred Stock, at least 5 days prior to the date
specified therein, a notice specifying the date on which any such record is to be taken for the
purpose of such dividend, distribution, right or other exchange, and the amount and character of
such dividend, distribution, right or other exchange.

(j) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Company
shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common

Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of all outstanding shares of Preferred
Stock such number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect
such conversion; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common
Stock shall not be sufficient to effect such conversion, in addition to such other remedies as shall
be available to the holder of such Preferred Stock, the Company will take such corporate action
as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares
of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including,
without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any
necessary amendment to this certificate of incorporation.

ACTIVE/92701222,2 14
(k) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this subsection 4
to be given to the holders of shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed given if deposited in the
United States mail, three (3) days after having been sent by registered or certified mail, return
receipt requested, postage prepaid, and addressed to each holder of record at his address
appearing on the books of the Company.

() Pay-to-Play; Special Mandatory Conversion.

(i) Trigger Event. In the event that any holder of shares of
Preferred Stock does not participate in the Qualified Financing (as defined below) by purchasing
in the aggregate, in the Qualified Financing and within the time period specified by the Company
in the Stock Purchase Agreement, such holder’s Pro Rata Amount (as defined below), then each
share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series A-2 Preferred Stock and Series B-1 Preferred Stock
held by such holder shall automatically, and without any further action on the part of such
holder, be converted into shares of Common Stock at the applicable Conversion Price then in
effect for such share of Preferred Stock, effective on the date specified by the Company in the
Stock Purchase Agreement. For purposes of determining the number of shares of Series A-1
Preferred Stock, Series A-2 Preferred Stock and Series B-1 Preferred Stock owned by a holder,
and for determining the number of Offered Securities (as defined below) a holder of shares of
Preferred Stock has purchased in the Qualified Financing, all shares of Series A-1 Preferred
Stock, Series A-2 Preferred Stock and Series B-1 Preferred Stock held by Affiliates (as defined
below) of such holder shall be aggregated with such holder’s shares and all Offered Securities
purchased by Affiliates of such holder shall be aggregated with the Offered Securities purchased
by such holder (provided that no shares or securities shall be attributed to more than one entity or
person within any such group of affiliated entities or persons). Such conversion is referred to as

a “Special Mandatory Conversion.”

(ii) Procedural Requirements. Upon a Special Mandatory
Conversion, each holder of shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series A-2 Preferred Stock and
Series B-1 Preferred Stock converted pursuant to subsection 4(1)(i) shall be sent written notice of
such Special Mandatory Conversion and the place designated for mandatory conversion of all
such shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series A-2 Preferred Stock and Series B-1 Preferred
Stock pursuant to this subsection 4(1). Upon receipt of such notice, each holder of such shares of
Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series A-2 Preferred Stock and Series B-1 Preferred Stock in
certificated form shall surrender his, her or its certificate or certificates for all such shares to the
Company or its transfer agent at the place designated in such notice; provided, however, that in
the event of an Special Mandatory Conversion pursuant to subsection 4(1), the outstanding shares
of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series A-2 Preferred Stock and Series B-1 Preferred Stock shall
be converted automatically without any further action by the holder of such shares and whether
or not the certificate representing such shares is surrendered to the Company or its transfer agent;
provided, further, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to issue certificates
evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such Special Mandatory Conversion
unless either the certificates evidencing such shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series A-2
Preferred Stock and Series B-1 Preferred Stock are delivered to the Company or its transfer agent
as provided above, or the holder notifies the Company or its transfer agent that such certificates
have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Company to
indemnify the Company from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates. If so

ACTIVE/92701222,2 15
required by the Company, any certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or
accompanied by written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the
Company, duly executed by the registered holder or by his, her or its attorney duly authorized in
writing. All rights with respect to the Series A-1] Preferred Stock, Series A-2 Preferred Stock and
Series B-1 Preferred Stock converted pursuant to subsection 4(1)(i), including the rights, if any,
to receive notices and vote (other than as a holder of Common Stock), will terminate at the time
of the Special Mandatory Conversion (notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders
thereof to surrender any certificates for such shares at or prior to such time), except only the
rights of the holders thereof, upon surrender of any certificate or certificates of such holders
therefor (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement), to receive the items provided for in the next
sentence of this subsection 4(1)(ii). As soon as practicable after the Special Mandatory
Conversion and, if applicable, the surrender of any certificate or certificates (or lost certificate
affidavit and agreement) for Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series A-2 Preferred Stock and Series
B-1 Preferred Stock so converted, the Company shall (a) issue and deliver to such holder, or to
his, her or its nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common
Stock issuable on such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof and (b) pay cash as
provided in subsection 4(h)(i) in lieu of any fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise
issuable upon such conversion and the payment of any declared but unpaid dividends on the
shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series A-2 Preferred Stock and Series B-1 Preferred Stock
converted. Such converted Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series A-2 Preferred Stock and Series B-
1 Preferred Stock shall be retired and cancelled and may not be reissued as shares of such series,
and the Company may thereafter take such appropriate action (without the need for stockholder
action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Series A-1 Preferred
Stock, Series A-2 Preferred Stock and Series B-1 Preferred Stock accordingly.

(iii) Definitions. For purposes of this subsection 4(1), the
following definitions shall apply:

(A) “Affiliate” shall mean, with respect to any holder of
shares of Preferred Stock, any person, entity or firm which, directly or indirectly,
controls, is controlled by or is under common control with such holder, including,
without limitation, any entity of which the holder is a partner or member, any partner,
officer, director, member or employee of such holder and any venture capital fund now or
hereafter existing of which the holder is a partner or member which is controlled by or
under common control with one or more general partners of such holder or shares the
same management company with such holder.

(B) “Offered Securities” shall mean the 17,257,233
shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock set aside by the Board of Directors of the Company
for purchase by holders of outstanding shares of Preferred Stock in connection with the
Qualified Financing, and offered to such holders.

(C) “Pro Rata Amount” shall mean, with respect to any
holder of Preferred Stock, a number of Offered Securities calculated (as of immediately
prior to the Qualified Financing) by multiplying 17,026,109 shares of Series B-2
Preferred Stock by a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the number of shares of
Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series A-2 Preferred Stock and Series B-1 Preferred Stock

ACTIVE/92701222,2 16
owned by such holder, and the denominator of which is equal to the aggregate number of
outstanding shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series A-2 Preferred Stock and Series
B-1 Preferred Stock.

(D) “Qualified Financing” shall mean the first

transaction involving the issuance or sale of Offered Securities by the Company after the
Filing Date that results in at least $5,000,000 in gross proceeds to the Company
(including the amount of any indebtedness of the Company cancelled in exchange for or
converted into shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock).

(E) “Stock Purchase Agreement” shall mean the Series
B-2 Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement pursuant to which the Company issues and sells
the Offered Securities in the Qualified Financing.

5, Voting Rights.

(a) Voting Other than for Directors. Except as required by law and in
subsection 5(b) below, the holder of each share of Preferred Stock shall have the right to one
vote for each share of Common Stock into which such Preferred Stock could be converted on the
record date for the vote or consent of stockholders, and, except as otherwise required by law,
with respect to such vote, such holder shall have full voting rights and powers equal to the voting
rights and powers of the holders of Common Stock. The holder of each share of Preferred Stock
shall be entitled, notwithstanding any provision hereof, to notice of any stockholders’ meeting in
accordance with the bylaws of the Company, and shall be entitled to vote with holders of
Common Stock upon the election of directors except as set forth in subsection 5(b) below and
upon any other matter submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Company, except as to those
matters required by law or this certificate of incorporation to be submitted to a class vote.
Fractional votes shall not, however, be permitted and any fractional voting rights available on an
as-converted basis (after aggregating all shares into which shares of Preferred Stock held by each
holder could be converted) shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number.

(b) Voting for Directors.

(i) With respect to the election of members of the Board of
Directors, (i) so long as at least a total of 1,000,000 shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock, Series
B-1 Preferred Stock and Series A-1 Preferred Stock are outstanding (as adjusted for stock splits,
stock dividends, stock combinations and the like), four (4) members of the Board of Directors
shall be elected by the holders of a majority of the Series B-2 Preferred Stock, the Series B-1
Preferred Stock and the Series A-1 Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class and on an
as-converted basis) (the “Preferred Directors”), and (ii) any remaining members of the Board of
Directors shall be elected by the holders of a majority of the Common Stock and the Preferred
Stock, voting together as a single class and on an as-converted basis (the “Joint Directors”).

(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 223(a)(1) and
223(a)(2) of the General Corporation Law, any vacancy, including newly created directorships
resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors or amendment of this Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, and vacancies created by removal or resignation of a director, may

ACTIVE/92701222,2 17
be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, though less than a quorum, or by a sole
remaining director, and the directors so chosen shall hold office until the next annual election
and until their successors are duly elected and shall qualify, unless sooner displaced; provided,
however, that where such vacancy occurs among the directors elected by the holders of a class or
series of stock, the holders of shares of such class or series may override the Board’s action to
fill such vacancy by (i) voting for their own designee to fill such vacancy at a meeting of the
corporation’s stockholders or (ii) written consent, if the consenting stockholders hold a sufficient
number of shares to elect their designee at a meeting of the stockholders. Any director may be
removed during his or her term of office, either with or without cause, by, and only by, the
affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of the class or series of stock entitled to elect such
director or directors, given either at a special meeting of such stockholders duly called for that
purpose or pursuant to a written consent of stockholders, and any vacancy thereby created may
be filled by the holders of that class or series of stock represented at the meeting or pursuant to
written consent.

6. Protective Provisions.

(a) So long as at least 1,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock (subject to
adjustment for any stock split, reverse stock split or other similar event affecting the Preferred
Stock after the filing date hereof) remain outstanding, in addition to any other vote or consent
required herein or by law, the Company shall not without first obtaining the approval (by vote or
written consent, as provided by law) of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class and not as separate series and on an as-
converted basis, take any of the following actions (whether by merger, recapitalization or
otherwise):

(i) increase or decrease (other than by conversion) the total
number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock;

(ii) create any equity security, including any other security
convertible into or exercisable for any equity security, having a preference over the Series B-2
Preferred Stock, the Series B-1 Preferred Stock or the Series A-1 Preferred Stock with respect to
voting rights, dividend rights or liquidation preference rights;

(iii) liquidate, dissolve or wind up the Company or consummate
an Acquisition;

{iv) redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire (or pay into or set
aside for a sinking fund for such purpose), directly or indirectly, any share or shares of Preferred
Stock or Common Stock; provided, however, that this restriction shall not apply to the
repurchase of shares of Common Stock from employees, officers, directors, consultants or other
persons performing services for the Company or any subsidiary pursuant to agreements under
which the Company has the option to repurchase such shares at cost or at cost upon the
occurrence of certain events, such as the termination of employment or the repurchase of any
shares pursuant to the exercise by the Company of contractual rights of first refusal with respect
to such shares;

ACTIVE/92701222,2 18
(v) declare or pay any dividend on or make any other
distribution, directly or indirectly, on account of any shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock
except for such dividends and distributions as may be approved by the Board of Directors,
including a majority of the Preferred Directors, which are in accordance with Article IV,
Section B.1 hereof;

(vi) change the authorized number of directors of the Company;
or

(vii) amend any provision of this certificate of incorporation or
the Company’s bylaws if such action would alter or change adversely the preferences, rights,
privileges or powers of, or the restrictions provided for the benefit of, the Preferred Stock
(provided, however, that in the event such proposed action adversely affects the rights,
preferences or privileges of any series of Preferred Stock in a manner differently than any other
series of Preferred Stock, such action shall, in addition to any other actions required hereunder,
also require the affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of a majority of the shares of
such series so affected),

Py Status of Converted or Reacquired Shares. Any share or shares of
Preferred Stock acquired by the Company by reason of redemption, purchase, conversion or

otherwise shall be retired and have the status of authorized but unissued shares of Preferred
Stock, without designation as to series until such shares are once more designated as part of a
particular series by the Board of Directors.

C. Common Stock.

L, Relative Rights of Preferred Stock and Common Stock. Ali preferences,
voting powers, relative, participating, optional or other special rights and privileges, and

qualifications, limitations, or restrictions of the Common Stock are expressly made subject and
subordinate to those that may be fixed with respect to any shares of the Preferred Stock.

2. Voting Rights. Except as otherwise required by law or this certificate of
incorporation, each holder of Common Stock shall have one vote in respect of each share of
stock held by such holder of record on the books of the Company for the election of directors and
on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Company. The number of authorized
shares of Common Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares
thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock of this
corporation entitled to vote, irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the General
Corporation Law.

3s Dividends. Subject to the preferential rights of the Preferred Stock, the
holders of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive, when and if declared by the
Board of Directors, out of the assets of the Company which are by law available therefor,
dividends payable either in cash, in property or in shares of capital stock.

4. Dissolution, Liquidation or Winding Up. In the event of any dissolution,

liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company, after distribution in full of the
preferential amounts, if any, to be distributed to the holders of shares of the Preferred Stock,

ACTIVE/92701222,2 19
holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to participate in any distribution of the assets of the
Company in accordance with Section B.2 of this Article IV.

ARTICLE V

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by the laws of the State of
Delaware:

A, The Board of Directors is expressly authorized to adopt, amend or repeal the
bylaws of the Company, provided, however, that the bylaws may only be amended in accordance
with the provisions thereof.

B. Elections of directors need not be by written ballot unless the bylaws of the
Company shall so provide.

C. The books of the Company may be kept at such place within or without the State
of Delaware as the bylaws of the Company may provide or as may be designated from time to
time by the Board of Directors.

ARTICLE VI

A. Limitation on Liability. A director of the Company shall not be personally liable
to the Company or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a
director, except for liability (1) for any breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to the Company or
its stockholders; (2) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional
misconduct or a knowing violation of law; (3) under Section 174 of the General Corporation
Law; or (4) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. If
the General Corporation Law hereafter is amended to further eliminate or limit the liability of
directors, then the liability of a director of the Company, in addition to the limitation on personal
liability provided herein, shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by the amended General
Corporation Law. Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article VI, or
the adoption of any provision in an amended or restated certificate of incorporation inconsistent
with this Article VI, shall be prospective only, and shall not adversely affect any right or
protection of any director of the Company existing at the time of such repeal, modification or
adoption.

B. Corporate Opportunities. In the event that a director of the Company who is also
a partner or employee of an entity that is a holder of Preferred Stock or any of its affiliates and
that is in the business of investing and reinvesting in other entities (each, a “Fund”), acquires
knowledge of a potential transaction or matter in such person’s capacity as a partner or employee
of the Fund and that may be a corporate opportunity for both the Company and such Fund, such
director shall to the fullest extent permitted by law have fully satisfied and fulfilled such
director’s fiduciary duty to the Company and its stockholders with respect to such corporate
opportunity, and the Company to the fullest extent permitted by law waives any claim that such
business opportunity constituted a corporate opportunity that should have been presented to the
Company or any of its affiliates, if such director acts in good faith in a manner consistent with
the following policy: a corporate opportunity offered to any person who is a director of the
Company, and who is also a partner or employee of a Fund shall belong to such Fund, unless

ACTIVE/92701222,2 20
such opportunity was expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director
of the Company.

Cc. For purposes of Section 500 of the California Corporations Code (to the extent
applicable), in connection with any repurchase of shares of Common Stock permitted under this
certificate of incorporation from employees, officers, directors or consultants of the Company in
connection with a termination of employment or services pursuant to agreements or
arrangements approved by the Board of Directors (in addition to any other consent required
under this certificate of incorporation), such repurchase may be made without regard to any
“preferential dividends arrears amount” or “preferential rights amount” (as those terms are
defined in Section 500 of the California Corporations Code). Accordingly, for purposes of
making any calculation under California Corporations Code Section 500 in connection with such
repurchase, the amount of any “preferential dividends arrears amount” or “preferential rights
amount” (as those terms are defined therein) shall be deemed to be zero.

ARTICLE VII

Except as otherwise provided in this certificate of incorporation, the Company reserves
the right to amend or repeal any provision, rescind or amend in any respect any provision
contained in this certificate of incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by
statute, and all rights conferred upon a stockholder herein are granted subject to this reservation.
