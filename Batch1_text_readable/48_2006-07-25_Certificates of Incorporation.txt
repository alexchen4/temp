PRE Se meee eee

a eer

Series B Preferred, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as 1s
determined by dividing $0.34 for each share of Series B Preferred by the Conversion Price at the
time in effect for such share. The initial Conversion Price for shares of Series B Preferred shal] be
$0.34 per share (the "Series B Conversion Price"); provided, however, that such Series A Conversion
Price und Series B. Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in subsection 3(c).

(ii) Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be
converted into shares of Common Stock at the then effective Conversion Price upon the con-
summation of the corporation's sale of its Common Stock in a bona fide, frm commitment
underwriting pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the "Securities Act"), which results in aggregate gross cash proceeds to the corporation in excess
of $10,000,000 and the public offering price cf which is not less than $5.00 per share (adjusted to
reflect subsequent stock dividends, stock splits or recapitaJizations). In the event of the automatic
conversion of the Preferred Stock upon a public offering as set forth above, the person(s) entitled
to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of Preferred Stock sha:’ .ot he
deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such sale
of securities.

(b) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shal]
be entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock, he shal] surrender the certificate or
certificates therefor, dulv endorsed, at the office of the corporation or of any transfer agent for such
stock, and shal! give written notice by mail, postage prepaid, td the cotporation at its principal
corporate office. of the election to convert the same and shall state therein the name or nvmes in
which the certificate or certificates for shares cf Common Stock are to be issued. The corporation
shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred
Stock, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of
shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid. Such conversion sliall
be deemed to have been made immediatel:, prior to the close of business on the date of such
surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to
receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes
as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock as of such date. If the conversion is
in connection with an underwritten offer of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act, the
conversion will be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriter of the sale of securities
pursuant to such offering, unless otherwise designated in wnting by the holders of such Preferred
Stock, in which event the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such
conversion of the Preferred Stock shall not he deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until
immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities.

(c) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stuck. The Conversion
Price of the Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from titre to time as follows:

(i) (A) Ifthe corporation, at any time or from time to time after
the date of the first issuance of shares of Series B Preferred (the "Purchase Date"), shali issue ans
Additional Stock (as defined below) without consideration or for a consideration per share less than
the Series A Conversion Prnce with respect to the Series A Preferred or the Series B Conversion
ee

Price with respect to the Series B Preferred. in effect on the date cf and iminediately prior to the
issuance of such Additional Stock, then and in such event, the Series A Conversion Price or the
Series B Conversion Price. as applicable, shall be reduced concurrently with such, issuance, to a price

* determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the

number of shares of Common Stock outstanding and the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon the conversion of the shares of Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to such
issuance plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration received by
the corporation for the total number of shares of Additional Steck so issued would purchase at such
Conversion Price, ard the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the shares
of Preferred Siv.ck outstanding immediately prior to such issuance plus the number cf such shares of
Additional Stock so issued. For the purposes of this subsection, the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to such :ssue shall be calculated on a fully diluted basis, as if al!
shares of Preferred Siock and all convertible securities had been fully converted into shares of
Common Stock immeviately prios to such issuance and any outstanding warrants, options or other
rights for the purchase ot shares uf stock or convertible securities had been fully exercised
immediately prior to such issuance (and the resulting securities fully converted into shares of
Common Stock, if so convertible) as of such date, but not including in such calculation any
additional shares of Common Stock issuable with respect to shares of Preferred Stock, convertible

. Securities? or outstanding options, warrants ox other rights for the purchase of shares of stock or

convertible securities, solely as a result of the adjustment of the Series A or’Series B Conversion
Price, as the case may be, (or other conversion ratios) resulting from the issuance of the Additional
Stock causing the adjustment in question. Immediately after any Additional Stock is deemed issued,
such Additional Stock shall be deemed to be outstanding.

(B) No adjustment of the Conversion Price for the Preferred
Stock shall be made in an amount less than one cent per share, provided that ar:y adjustments which
are not required to be made by reason of this sentence shall be carried forward and shall be either
taken into account in any subsequent adjustment made prior to 3 years from the date of the event
giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward, or shall be made at the end of 3 years trom the
date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward. Except to the limited extent
provided for in subsections (E)(3) and (EX4), no adjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this
subsection 3(c){i) shall have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price above the Conversion
Price in effect iinmediately prio: .o such adjustment.

(C) Inthe case of the issuance of Common Siock for cash.
the consideration shal! be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting any
reasonable discounts, ccmmissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the corporation for
any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

(D) Inthe case of the issuance of the Common Stock fora
consideration in whole cr in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shal! be deemed
to be the fair value thereof as determined by the Board of Dircctors irrespective of any accounting
treatment.

issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration, if any, received by the corporation for any
such securities and related options or rights (excluding any cash received on account of accrued |
interest .or accrued. dividends); plus the additiénal consideration, if any; to be received by the
corporation upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or the exercise of any related options
or rights (the consideration in each case to be determined in the manner provided in subsections

3(cMi4C) and 3(c)(iXD)).

3. In the event of any change in the number of
shares of Common Stock deliverable or any increase in the consideration payable to the corporation
upon exercise of such options or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such convertible or
exchangeable securities, including, but not limited to, a change resulting from the antidilution
provisions thereof, the Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock obtained with respect to the
adjustment which was made upon the issuance of such options, rights or securities. and any
subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall be recomputed to reflect such change. but no further
adjustment shall be made for the actual issuance of Common Stock or any payment of such
consideration upon the exercise of any such options or rights or the conversion or exchange of such
