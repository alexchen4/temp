B. Preferred Stock. The rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to and
imposed on the Preferred Stock are as follows:

lew
I. Dividend Provisions. The holders of shares of Preferred Stock shal] be
entitled to receive dividends, pari passu to each other, at a rate of $0.012 per share of Series A
Preferred per annum, $0.0204 per share of Series B Preferred per annum, $0.029784 per share of
Series C Preferred per annum and $60.00 per share of Series D Preferred per annum (adjusted to
reflect stock splits, stock dividends and recapitalizations), each payable out of funds legally available
therefor, Such dividends shall not cumulatively accrue and shal! be payable only when, as and if
declared by the Board of Directors and shall be noncumulative. No dividends (other than those
payable solely in Common Stock or other securities and rights convertible into or entitling the holder
thereof to receive, directly or indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock of the corporation) shall
be payable on any Common Stock of the corporation during any fiscal year of the corporation until
dividends in the amount specified above per share (adjusted to reflect stock splits, stock dividends
and recapitalizations) on the Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred, Series C Preferred and Series D
Preferred shall have been paid or declared and set apart during that fiscal year. No dividend shall be
paid on or declared and set apart for the shares of any series of Preferred Stock for any dividend
period unless at the same time a like proportionate dividend for the same dividend period, ratably in
proportion to the respective annual dividend rates fixed therefor, shall be paid on or declared and set
apart for the shares of all other such series of Preferred Stock. After the holders of the Preferred
Stock have received their dividend preference as set forth above, any dividends declared by the
Board of Directors out of funds legally available therefor shall be shared equally among all
outstanding shares on an as-converted basis. All references to currency amounts or other
consideration shall be denominated in United States Dollars,

2. Liquidation Preference.

(a) Upon any Liquidity Event (as defined below), each holder of Preferred
Stock shall be entitled to be paid, before any distribution or payment is made upon any holders of
Common Stock, an amount in cash equal to the greater of:

(i) The sum of

(x) the aggregate Liquidation Preference of all shares of
Preferred Stock then held by such holder, plus

(y) | an amount equal to a ratable portion of any assets and
funds that remain for distribution in respect of Common Stock (and any Preferred Stock entitled to
participate as a single class with the holders of Common Stock in such a distribution) after payment
in full of all other amounts payable to the holders of Preferred Stock under this Article II] other than
on an as-if-converted basis as a single class with the Common Stock, which ratable portion shall be

determined as if all of such holder's Preferred Stock (and all other shares of Preferred Stock) were
_ converted into Common Stock immediately prior to such Liquidity Event; :

provided that in no event shall the amount paid pursuant to this clause (i) be greater than $0.50 per
share of Series A Preferred, $0.85 per share of Series B Preferred, $1.241 per share of Series C
Preferred, and $2,500.00 per share of the Series D Preferred; and

Gi} The sum of:
(x) alf declared but unpaid dividends on each such share of
Preferred Stock then held by such holder, plus

(y) | an amount equal to a ratable portion of any assets and
funds that remain for distribution in respect of Common Stock (and any Preferred Stock entitled to
participate as a single class with the holders of Common Stock in such a distribution) after payment
in full of all other amounts payable to the holders of Preferred Stock under this Article III other than
on an as-if-converted basis as a single class with the Common Stock, which ratable portion shall be
determined as if all of such holder's Preferred Stock (and all other shares of Preferred Stock) were
converted into Common Stock immediately prior to such Liquidity Event,

in which event such holder of Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any further payment in respect
thereof,

As used herein, "Liquidation Preference" means: (w) $0.20 with respect to each share of Series A
Preferred, (x) $0.34 with respect to each share of Series B Preferred, (y) $0.4964 with respect to
each share of Series C Preferred, and (z) $1,000 with respect to each share of Series D Preferred, in
each case plus all declared but unpaid dividends on each such share of Preferred Stock. If, upon the
occurrence of such a Liquidity Event, the assets and funds thus distributed among the holders of the
Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full Liquidation
Preference, then the entire assets and funds of the corporation legally available for distribution shall
be distributed ratably among the holders of the Preferred Stock in proportion to the preferential
amount each such holder is entitled to receive with respect to its Preferred Stock pursuant to this
Section 2.

(6b) = After the distributions described in Section 2(a) above have been paid
in full, the remaining assets of the corporation available for distribution to shareholders shall be
distributed among the holders of Common Stock pro rata based on the number of shares of Common
Stock held by each such holder. For the avoidance of doubt, any holder of Preferred Stock electing
to convert Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock prior to the Liquidity Event shall not be
entitled to the Liquidation Preference or any other amount otherwise payable under Section 2(a) with
respect to such converted Preferred Stock, but shall have only the full rights under this Section 2(6)
of a holder of the Common Stock issued upon such conversion.

(c) Ifa Liquidity Event involves the payment by a successor or purchasing
entity to the corporation's sharcholders of consideration in whole or in part other than cash, then at
the election of the Series D Majority the amounts payable to the holders of the Series D Preferred
pursuant to this Section2 shall be paid in the same form of consideration that is paid to the
corporation's other shareholders, and if any of the corporation's other shareholders are given an
option as to the form of consideration to be received, then all holders of Series D Preferred shall be
given the same option (with it being understood that the value of any such non-cash consideration
shall be determined as provided in Section 2(e) of this Article II or, at the election of the Series D
Majority, as may be provided in the definitive agreement(s) entered into in connection with any such
Liquidity Event).
(d) "Liquidity Event" shall mean (i) the acquisition of the corporation by
another person by means of any transaction or series of related transactions to which the corporation
is party (including, without limitation, any stock acquisition, reorganization, merger or
consolidation), other than a transaction or series of related transactions in which the beneficial
holders of the voting securities of the corporation outstanding immediately prior to such transaction
or series of related transactions retain, immediately after such transaction or series of related
transactions, as a result of shares in the corporation held by such holders prior to such transaction or
series of related transactions, at least a majority of the total voting power represented by the
outstanding voting securities of the corporation or such other surviving or resulting entity (or if the
corporation or such other surviving or resulting entity is a wholly-owned subsidiary immediately
following such acquisition, its parent) following such transaction or series of related transactions, (ii)
a sale, lease or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole by means of any transaction or series of related transactions, except
where such sale, lease or other disposition is to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the corporation or (iii)
a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary.

(ce) Any securities to be delivered to the holders of the Preferred Stock
and/or Common Stock pursuant to Section 2(c) above shall be valued as follows:

(i) If traded on a securities exchange or a quotation system, the
value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange or
quotation system over the 30-day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing of the Liquidity
Event;

(ii) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be deemed
to be the average of the closing bid prices over the 30-day period ending three (3) days prior to the
closing of the Liquidity Event; and

(iii) If there is no active public market, the value shall be the fair
market value thereof at the closing of the Liquidity Event, as determined in good faith jointly by the
Series D Majority and the Board of Directors of the corporation (without applying any marketability,
minority or other discounts). If such parties are unable to reach agreement within a reasonable period
of time, the fair value of such consideration shall be determined by an independent appraiser (other
than one of the "Big Four" accounting firms) experienced in valuing such type of consideration
jointly selected by the corporation and the Series D Majority. The determination of such appraiser
shall be final and binding upon the parties, and the fees and expenses of such appraiser shall be
borne by the corporation.

(f) In the event of a Liquidity Event, if any portion of the consideration
payable to the shareholders of the corporation is placed into escrow and/or is payable to the
shareholders of the corporation subject to contingencies, then unless the Series D Majority waives
such treatment, the purchase or merger or other agreement effecting such Liquidity Event shall
provide that (i) the portion of such consideration that is not placed in escrow and not subject to any
contingencies (the ‚ÄúInitial Consideration") shall be allocated among the holders of capital stock of
the corporation as if the Initial Consideration were the only consideration payable in connection with,
such deemed Liquidity Event and (ii) any additional consideration which becomes payable to the

4

shareholders of the corporation upon release from escrow or satisfaction of contingencies shall be
allocated among the holders of capital stock of the corporation in accordance with Section 2 of this
Article Il after taking into account the previous payment of the Initial Consideration as part of the
same transaction.

3, Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights
as follows (the "Conversion Rights"):

(a) Right to Convert.

(i) Each share of Series A Preferred shall be convertible, at the
option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share, at the office of the
corporation or any transfer agent for such Series A Preferred, into such number of fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing $0.20 for each share of
Series A Preferred by the Conversion Price at the time in effect for such share (adjusted to reflect
subsequent stock dividends, stock splits or recapitalizations), The initial Conversion Price for shares
of Series A Preferred shall be $0.20 per share (the "Series A Conversion Price"). Each share of
Series B Preferred shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date
of issuance of such share, at the office of the corporation or any transfer agent for such Series B
Preferred, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is
determined by dividing $0.34 for each share of Series B Preferred by the Conversion Price at the
time in effect for such share (adjusted to reflect subsequent stock dividends, stock splits or
recapitalizations). The initial Conversion Price for shares of Series B Preferred shall be $0.34 per
share (the ‚ÄúSeries B Conversion Price"), Each share of Series C Preferred shall be convertible, at
the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share, at the office of
the corporation or any transfer agent for such Series C Preferred, into such number of fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing $0.4964 for each share of
Series C Preferred by the Conversion Price at the time in effect for such share (adjusted to reflect
subsequent stock dividends, stock splits or recapitalizations), The initial Conversion Price for shares
of Series C Preferred shall be $0.4964 per share (the "Series C Conversion Price"). Each share of
Series D Preferred shali be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date
of issuance of such share, at the office of the corporation or any transfer agent for such Series D
Preferred, into such number (the ‚ÄúSeries D Conversion Ratio‚Äù) of fully paid and nonassessable
shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing $1,000 for each share of Series D Preferred
{the "Series D Purchase Price") by the Conversion Price at the time in effect for such share
(adjusted to reflect subsequent stock dividends, stock splits or recapitalizations). The initial
Conversion Price for shares of Series D Preferred shall be $2.420682 per share (the ‚ÄúSeries D
Conversion Price‚Äú), The Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series C
Conversion Price and Series D Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in
subsection 3(c).

(ii) | Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted
into shares of Common Stock at the then effective Conversion Price upon the consummation of the
corporation's sale of its Common Stock in a bona fide, firm commitment underwriting pursuant to a
registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), which
results in aggregate gross cash proceeds to the corporation in excess of $10,000,000 and the public

5

offering price (before deducting commissions, discounts or expenses) of which is not less than $5.00
per share (adjusted to reflect subsequent stock dividends, stock splits or recapitalizations)
("Qualified Offering"). In the event of the automatic conversion of the Preferred Stock upon a
Qualified Offering as set forth above, the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable
upon such conversion of Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock
until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities,

(iii) | Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, in the
event of a Qualified Offering or the corporation's initial sale of its Common Stock in a bona fide,
firm commitment underwriting pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act in which
all of the Series D Preferred are converted to Common Stock (each an "IPO Preference Triggering
Offering"), each holder of Series D Preferred shal! be entitled to receive for each share of Series D
Preferred then held by them (in addition to the Common Stock issuable upon the automatic
conversion of the Series D Preferred pursuant to subsection 3(a}{ii)) an amount per share equal to the
product obtained by multiplying:

(A) _ the Series D Conversion Ratio by

(B) (x) the product obtained by multiplying the Series D
Conversion Price (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reclassifications, combinations,
reorganizations and the like) by the Series D Multiple (as determined below) minus (y) the IPO Price
(as defined below), (such payment the "Series D IPO Preference Payment‚Äô).

In no event, however, shall the Series D [PO Preference Payment be (i) less than zero (0) or (ii)
greater than the Series D IPO Preference Maximum Payment (as determined below) per share. The
Series D IPO Preference Payment shail be payable, at the election of the corporation, in cash, shares
of Common Stock (which shall be valued at the IPO Price) or a combination of cash and shares of
Common Stock (which shalt be valued at the IPO Price).

(iv) ‚ÄúIPO Price" shail mean the public offering price per share
(before deducting commissions, discounts or expenses) of the IPO Preference Triggering Offering.

(v) The "Series D Multiple" shail be determined as follows:

(A) in the event that the consummation of an IPO
Preference Triggering Offering occurs on or prior to the one (1) year anniversary of the Series D
Purchase Date, then the Series D Multiple shall be 1.5;

(B) in the event that the consummation of an IPO
Preference Triggering Offering occurs after the one (1) year anniversary of the Series D Purchase
Date but on or prior to the two (2) year anniversary of the Series D Purchase Date, then the Series D
Multiple shall be equal to 1.5 plus the product of (x) 0.5 and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of days elapsed between the one (|) year anniversary of the Series D Purchase Date and
the date of the consummation of the IPO Preference Triggering Offering, and the denominator of
which i is 365; or

(C) in the event that the consummation of an IPO
Preference Triggering Offering occurs on or after the two (2) year anniversary of the Series D
Purchase Date, then the Series D Multiple shall be 2.0.

(vi) The "Series D IPO Preference Maximum Payment" shall be
equal to the product obtained by multiplying:

(A) _ the Series D Conversion Ratio by

(B) (x) the then-current Series D Conversion Price minus
(y) $1.84184 (adjusted to reflect subsequent stock dividends, stock splits or recapitalizations).

(b) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall
be entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock, he shail surrender the certificate or
certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the corporation or of any transfer agent for such
stock, and shall give written notice by mail, postage prepaid, to the corporation at its principal
corporate office, of the election to convert the same and shall state therein the name or names in
which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued. The corporation
shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, (i) issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred
Stock, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of
shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid, (ii) cash in an amount
of all declared and unpaid dividends on the shares of Preferred Stock converted and (iii) if
applicable, cash as required pursuant to the last sentence of Section 3(g)(i). If the corporation is not
permitted under applicable law to pay any portion of any accrued or declared and unpaid dividends
on the Preferred Stock being converted, the corporation shall pay such dividends to the converting
holder as soon thereafter as funds of the corporation are legally available for such payment. At the
request of any such converting hoider, the corporation shall provide such holder with written
evidence of its obligation to pay such dividends to such holder, Such conversion shall be deemed to
have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the
shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder
or holders of such shares of Common Stock as of such date. If the conversion is in connection with
an underwritten offer of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act, the conversion will be
conditioned upon the closing with the underwriter of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering,
unless otherwise designated in writing by the holders of such Preferred Stock, in which event the
person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of the Preferred
Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the
closing of such sale of securities.

(c) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock. The Conversion
Price of the Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

(i) (A) _ If the corporation, at any time or from time to time after
the date of the first issuance of shares of Series D Preferred (the "Series D Purchase Date"), shall
issue any Additional Stock (as defined below) without consideration or for a consideration per share
less than the Series A Conversion Price with respect to the Series A Preferred, the Series B

7

Conversion Price with respect to the Series B Preferred, the Series C Conversion Price with respect
to the Series C Preferred or the Series D Conversion Price with respect to the Series D Preferred, in
effect on the date of and immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock, then and in
such event, the Series A Conversion Price, the Series B Conversion Price, the Series C Conversion
Price or the Series D Conversion Price, as applicable, shall be reduced concurrently with such
issuance, to a price determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of
which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding and the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the shares of Preferred Stock outstanding
immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate
consideration received by the corporation for the total number of shares of Additional Stock so
issued would purchase at such Conversion Price, and the denominator of which shall be the number
of shares of Common Stock outstanding and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
the conversion of the shares of Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance plus
the number of such shares of Additional Stock so issued. The ‚ÄúEffective Price‚Äù of Additional Stock
shall mean the quotient determined by dividing the total number of Additional Stock issued or sold,
or under subsection 3(c)(i)(E) deemed to have been issued or sold, into the aggregate consideration
received or under subsection 3(c)(i)(C) or 3(c)(i)(D) deemed to have been received by the
corporation for such Additional Stock. For the purposes of this subsection and subsections (v) and
(vi) below, the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such-issue shall
be calculated on a fully diluted basis, as if all shares of Preferred Stock and all convertible securities
had been fully converted into shares of Common Stock immediately prior to such issuance and any
outstanding warrants, options or other rights for the purchase of shares of stock or convertible
securities had been fully exercised immediately prior to such issuance (and the resulting securities
fully converted into shares of Common Stock, if so convertible) as of such date, but not including in
such calculation any additional shares of Common Stock issuable with respect to shares of Preferred
Stock, convertible securities, or outstanding options, warrants or other rights for the purchase of
shares of stock or convertible securities, solely as a result of the adjustment of the Series A
Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price or Series D Conversion
Price, as the case may be, (or other conversion ratios) resulting from the issuance of the Additional
Stock causing the adjustment in question. Immediately after any Additional Stock is deemed issued,
such Additional Stock shall be deemed to be outstanding.

(B) No adjustment of the Conversion Price for the Preferred
Stock shall be made in an amount less than one cent per share, provided that any adjustments which
are not required to be made by reason of this sentence shall be carried forward and shall be either
taken into account in any subsequent adjustment made prior to 3 years from the date of the event
giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward, or shall be made at the end of 3 years from the
date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward. Except to the limited extent
provided for in subsections (E)(3) and (E)(4), no adjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this
subsection 3(c)(i) shall have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price above the Conversion
Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment.

(C) In the case of the issuance of Common Stock for cash,
the consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting any
reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the corporation

~ for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

8

(D) In the case of the issuance of the Common Stock for a
consideration in whole o or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be deemed
to be the fair value thereof as determined by the Board of Directors irrespective of any accounting
treatment.

(E) In the case of the issuance, whether before, on or after
the Series D Purchase Date, of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common Stock,
securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock or options to purchase
or rights to subscribe for such convertible or exchangeable securities (which are not excluded from
the definition of Additional Stock), the following provisions shall apply:

t. The aggregate maximum number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable upon exercise of such options to purchase or rights to subscribe for
Common Stock shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such options or rights were issued
and for a consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in subsections
3(¬¢)(I)(C) and 3(¬¢)(i)(D)), if any, received by the corporation upon the issuance of such options or
rights plus the minimum purchase price provided in such options or rights for the Common Stock
covered thereby.

2, The aggregate maximum number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of or in exchange for any such convertible or
exchangeable securities or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such
convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof shall be
deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or such options or rights were
issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration, if any, received by the corporation for any
such securities and related options or rights (excluding any cash received on account of accrued
interest or accrued dividends), plus the additional consideration, if any, to be received by the
corporation upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or the exercise of any related options
or rights (the consideration in each case to be determined in the manner provided in subsections

3()(i(C) and 3(¬¢)(1)(D)).

3, In the event of any change in the number of
shares of Common Stock deliverable or any increase in the consideration payable to the corporation
upon exercise of such options or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such convertible or
exchangeable securities, inchiding, but not limited to, a change resulting from the antidilution
provisions thereof, the Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock obtained with respect to the
adjustment which was made upon the issuance of such options, rights or securities, and any
subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall be recomputed to reflect such change, but no further
adjustment shall be made for the actual issuance of Common Stock or any payment of such
consideration upon the exercise of any such options or rights or the conversion or exchange of such
securities.

4, Other than issuances made pursuant to Section
3(c){ii)(B) (for which no adjustment shall be made under this Section 3(c)(i)(E)(4)), upon the
expiration of any such options or rights, the termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or
the expiration of any options or rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the

9

Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock obtained with respect to the adjustment which was made
upon the issuance of such options, rights or securities or options or rights related to such securities,
and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall be recomputed to reflect the issuance of only
the number of shares of Common Stock actually issued upon the exercise of such options or rights,
upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or upon the exercise of the options or rights
related to such securities. Other than issuances made pursuant to Section 3(c)(ii)(B) (for which no
adjustment shall be made under this Section 3(c)(i)(E)(4)), upon the expiration of any such options
or rights, the termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options
or rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, only the number of shares of
Common Stock actually issued upon the exercise of such options or rights, upon the conversion or
exchange of such securities or upon the exercise of the options or rights related to such securities
shall continue to be deemed to be issued.

5. All Common Stock deemed issued pursuant to
this subsection 3(c)(i)(E) shall be considered issued only at the time of its deemed issuance and any
actual issuance of such stock shall not be an actual issuance or a deemed issuance of the
corporation's Common Stock under the provisions of this Section 3; provided however, that in the
case of any options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common Stock which expire by their terms
not more than 30 days after the date of issue thereof (other than issuances made pursuant to Section
3(e)(ii)(B) (for which no adjustment shall be made under Section 3(c)(i)(E)(4))), no adjustment of

- the Conversion Price shall be made until the expiration or exercise of all such options or rights,

whereupon such adjustment shal) be made in the same manner provided in subsection (E)(4) above.

(ii) "Additional Stock‚Äù shall mean any shares of Common Stock
issued (or deemed to have been issued pursuant to subsection 3(c)(i)(E)) by the corporation on or
after the Series D Purchase Date other than shares of Common Stock issued or issuable:

(A) pursuant to a transaction described in subsection
3(c)(iii) hereof,

(B) as incentive compensation to employees, consultants or
directors of this corporation pursuant to a stock option plan or restricted stock plan approved by the
Board of Directors of this corporation, subject to a maximum of 10,557,051 additional shares of
Common Stock issued or issuable (determined on a net basis taking into account shares, options or
other convertible securities that are forfeited for no consideration or repurchased at the original cost
thereof},

(C) to banks, equipment lessors or landlords, provided such
issuances are for other than equity financing purposes,

(D) for which adjustment of the Conversion Price is made

Additional Brocade Stock (other than the Brocade Warrant) or

(L) (i) in a bona fide, firmly underwritten public offering of
shares of Common Stock before or in connection with which all outstanding shares of Preferred
Stock are converted to Common Stock, or (ii) upon exercise of warrants or rights granted to
underwriters in connection with such a public offering, which warrants or rights are unanimously
approved by the Board of Directors,

(iii) In the event the corporation should at any time or from time to
time after the Series D Purchase Date fix a record date for the effectuation of a split or subdivision of
the outstanding shares of Common Stock or the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled
to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock or other
securities or rights convertible into, or entitling the holder thereof to receive directly or indirectly,
additional shares of Common Stock (hereinafter referred to as "Common Stock Equivalents")
without payment of any consideration by such holder for the additional shares of Common Stock or
the Common Stock Equivalents (including the additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion or exercise thereof), then, as of such record date (or the date of such dividend
distribution, split or subdivision if no record date is fixed), the Conversion Price of the Preferred
Stock shall be appropriately decreased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on
conversion of each share of such series shall be increased in proportion to such increase of the
aggregate shares of Common Stock outstanding and those issuable with respect to such Common
Stock Equivalents.

(iv) If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any

time after the Series D Purchase Date is decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock, then, following the record date of such combination, the Conversion Price for the

1]

Preferred Stock shall be appropriately increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock

_ issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease

in outstanding shares.

(v) If the corporation, at any time or from time to time after the
Series D Purchase Date, shall issue additional shares of Series D Preferred at the same price that
Series D Preferred was issued to the initial holder of the first share of Series D Preferred issued (the
‚ÄúAdditional Brocade Stock") to Brocade Communications Systems, Inc. or its affiliates (or their
designees) (collectively ‚ÄúBrocade"), the Series D Conversion Price shall be reduced concurrently
with such issuance, to a price equal to the difference of:

(A) The Series D Conversion Price immediately prior to
such event, minus

(B) The quotient of (x) the aggregate consideration received
by the corporation (which consideration may include, without limitation, cancellation of
indebtedness pursuant to the terms of any settlement agreement with Brocade) for the total number
of shares of Additional Brocade Stock so issued taking into account the adjustment to the Series D
Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 3(c)(v) (the "Brocade Investment Amount"), divided by
(y) 190,029,098.

It is the intention of the corporation and the holders of the Series D Preferred that the aggregate
percentage ownership represented by the Series D Preferred as of the Series D Purchase Date, should
{all else equal (i.e., assuming no other issuances or repurchases of capital stock of the corporation))
be no less because of the issuance of the Additional Brocade Stock. If, other than the issuance of
Additional Brocade Stock in accordance with the terms herein, the corporation issues any other
capital stock to Brocade, whether pursuant to (1) issuance of Common Stock or another series of
preferred stock of the corporation or (2) warrants or options to acquire capital stock of the
corporation, the Series D Conversion Price shall be appropriately reduced to an amount which
reflects an underlying common percentage ownership assuming that no such issuances occurred;
provided, that, with respect to the first warrant issued to Brocade (the "Brocade Warrant"), the
capital stock issuable pursuant to the Brocade Warrant shall not be deemed to be issued until such
time as the Brocade Warrant becomes exercisable pursuant to its terms. If the corporation issues any
other capital stock in an amount up to $15,000,000 in order to avoid a default under the corporation's
credit facilities, whether issued to existing holders of Series D Preferred or not or whether pursuant
to (1) issuance of Common Stock or another series of preferred stock of the corporation or (2)
warrants or options to acquire capital stock of the corporation, the Series D Conversion Price shall
be appropriately reduced to an amount which reflecis an underlying common percentage ownership
assuming that no such issuances occurred (and other appropriate adjustments to these articles of
incorporation shall be made consistent with such adjustment). No adjustment of the Series D
Conversion Price for the Series D Preferred Stock shall be made in an amount fess than one cent per
share, provided that any adjustments which are not required to be made by reason of this sentence
shall be carried forward and shall be either taken into account in any subsequent adjustment made
prior to 3 years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward, or
shall be made at the end of 3 years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being
carried forward.

12

(vi) If the corporation, (a) at any time after the issuance of
Additional Brocade Stock, if any is issued, or (b) at any time after the date that is 30 days following
the Series D Purchase Date, but in each case on or prior to September 30, 2013, shall repurchase up
to an aggregate of $40,000,000 of shares of Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred or Series C
Preferred at a purchase price per share not to exceed the then-current Series D Conversion Price
from holders thereof but only in a transaction in which, and only to the extent that, the 2013
Repurchase Shares (as defined below) are repurchased with proceeds from the issuance of additional
Series D Preferred after the Series D Purchase Date (other than the Additional Brocade Stock, if any)
in connection with such repurchase (and which Series D Preferred shall be issued prior to the 2013
Repurchase) (the "2013 Repurchase"), the Series D Conversion Price shall be increased,
concurrently with such repurchase, to a price equal to the quotient of (assuming no other issuances
of capital stock since the Series D Purchase Date other than the Additional Brocade Stock, if any):

(A) The difference of:

(x) the Series D Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such repurchase multiplied by 190,029,098, minus

(y) the aggregate doflar amount paid to repurchase
shares of Preferred Stock in the 2013 Repurchase (the "2013 Repurchase Dollars"), divided by

(B) The difference of:
(x) 190,029,098, minus

(y) the aggregate number of shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of the shares of Preferred Stock repurchased pursuant to the 2013
Repurchase (the "2013 Repurchase Shares").

It is the intention of the corporation and the holders of Series D Preferred that the aggregate
percentage ownership represented by the Series D Preferred immediately following the 2013
Repurchase shall not be greater than such aggregate percentage ownership immediately prior to the
2013 Repurchase (all else equal including without taking into account any additional Series D
Preferred purchased or otherwise acquired simultaneously with the 2013 Repurchase). No
adjustment of the Series D Conversion Price for the Series D Preferred shall be made in an amount
less than one cent per share, provided that any adjustments which are not required to be made by
reason of this sentence shall be carried forward and shall be either taken into account in any
subsequent adjustment made prior to 3 years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment
being carried forward, or shal! be made at the end of 3 years from the date of the event giving rise to
the adjustment being carried forward.

(vii) The Series D Conversion Price shall be subject to further
adjustment but only prior to an IPO if the corporation recognizes: revenue (as determined in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States in effect as of
December 31, 2013) of at least $160,000,000 for its fiscal year ending December 31, 2013, as

13

indicated in its audited financial statements for such fiscal year (such event, the ‚ÄúPerformance
Yarget Achievement").

Upon the occurrence of the Performance Target Achievement (which event shall not be deemed to
occur, if at all, until the issuance by the corporation's independent registered public accounting firm
of its report on the corporation's audited financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31,
2013 consistent with past practice), the Series D Conversion Price shall be increased to a price equal
to the quotient of (assuming no other issuances or repurchases of capital stock since the Series D
Purchase Date other than the Additional Brocade Stock and the 2013 Repurchase Shares, if any):

(x) 490,000,000 (x) minus the Brocade Investment Amount
(y) minus the 2013 Repurchase Dollars, divided by

(y} 190,029,098 minus the 2013 Repurchase Shares.

No adjustment of the Series D Conversion Price for the Series D Preferred shall be made in
an amount less than one cent per share, provided that any adjustments which are not required to be
made by reason of this sentence shall be carried forward and shall be either taken into account in any
subsequent adjustment made prior to 3 years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment
being carried forward, or shall be made at the end of 3 years from the date of the event giving rise to
the adjustment being carried forward.

(d) Other Distributions. In the event the corporation shall declare a
distribution payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by the
- corporation or other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred to in
subsection 3(c)(iii), then, in each such case for the purpose of this subsection 3(d), the holders of the
Preferred Stock shal! be entitled to a proportionate share of any such distribution as though they
were the holders of the number of shares of Common Stock of the corporation into which their
shares of Preferred Stock are convertible as of the record date fixed for the determination of the
holders of Common Stock of the corporation entitled to receive such distribution.

(ec)  Recapitalizations. If at any time or from time to time there shall be a
recapitalization of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision, combination or merger or sale of
assets transaction provided for elsewhere in Sections 2 or 3) provision shall be made so that the
holders of the Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of the Preferred
Stock the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the corporation or otherwise, to
which a holder of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled on such
recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the
provisions of this Section 3 with respect to the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock after the
recapitalization to the end that the provisions of this Section 3 (including adjustment of the
Conversion Price then in effect and the number of shares purchasable upon conversion of the
Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event as nearly equivalent as may be practicable,

(f) No Impairment; Governmental Filings. The corporation will not, by
amendment of its Articles of Incorporation or through any reorganization, recapitalization, transfer
of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action,

14
avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or
performed under these Articles of Incorporation by the corporation, but will at all times in good faith
assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Section 3 and in the taking of all such action as
may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the Conversion Rights of the holders of the
Preferred Stock against impairment. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not restrict or
limit the corporation from amending these Articles of Incorporation in accordance with Sections 902
and 903 of the California General Corporation Law. The corporation shall assist and cooperate with
any holder of Preferred Stock required to make any governmental filings or obtain any governmental
approval prior to or in connection with any conversion of shares of Preferred Stock hereunder
(including, without limitation, making any filings required to be made by the corporation),

(g) No Fractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments.

(i) No fractional shares shall be issued upon conversion of the
Preferred Stock, and the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion shall be
rounded up to the nearest whole share. Whether or not fractional shares are issuable upon such
conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock the
holder is at the time converting into Common Stock and the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon such aggregate conversion, In lieu of any fractional share to which any holder would
otherwise be entitled upon conversion of some or all of the Preferred Stock owned by such holder,
the corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair value thereof as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(ii) | Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of any
Conversion Price of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 3, the corporation, at its expense, shall
promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and prepare
and furnish to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or
readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based.
The corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock, furnish
or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (A) such adjustment and
readjustment, (B) the Conversion Price at the time in effect, and (C) the number of shares of
Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon
the conversion of a share of Preferred Stock.

(h) Notices of Record Date. In the event of any taking by the corporation
of a record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof
who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend) or other distribution, any right
to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of stock of any class or any other
securities or property, or to receive any other right, the corporation shall mail to each holder of
Preferred Stock, at least 20 days prior to the date specified therein, a notice specifying the date on
which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or right, and the
amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right.

(i) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The corporation
shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common

Stock solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock such

15

number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of
all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, in addition to such other remedies as shail be
available to the holder of such Preferred Stock, the corporation will take such corporate action as
may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of
Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes. All shares of
Common Stock which are so issuable shall, when issued, be duly and validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and free from all taxes, liens, charges and encumbrances.

; (j) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Section 3 to be
given to the holders of shares of Preferred Stock shall be sent by airmail, postage prepaid, and
addressed to each holder of record at his address appearing on the books of the corporation, and shall
be deemed given ten (10) days after deposit.

4, Voting Rights.

(a) Each holder of shares of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to the
number of votes equal to the number of shares of Common Stock into which such Preferred Stock
could then be converted (with any fractional share determined on an aggregate conversion basis
being rounded to the nearest whole share), and with respect to such vote, such holder shall have full
voting rights and powers equal to the voting rights and powers of the holders of Common Stock
(except as otherwise expressly provided herein or as required by law, voting together with holders of
Common Stock, with respect to any question upon which holders of Common Stock have the right to
vote), and shall be entitled, notwithstanding any provision hereof, to notice of any shareholders‚Äô
meeting in accordance with the by-laws of the corporation.

as-if-converted basis, shall be entitled to elect the remaining director.

(c) In the case of any vacancy in the office of a director occurring among
the directors elected by the holders of (i) Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred and Series C
Preferred or (ii) the Common Stock pursuant to the second and fourth sentences of Section 4(b)
above, the remaining directors may, by affirmative vote of a majority thereof (or the remaining
director if there is but one, or if there is no such director remaining, by the affirmative vote of the
holders of the shares entitled to elect such director, as the case may be, in accordance with California
Corporations Code ¬ß 305) elect a successor or successors to hold the office for the unexpired term of
the director or directors whose place or places shall be vacant. In the case of any vacancy in the
office of the director elected by the holders of Series D Preferred, the Series D Majority (as defined
below) may, by affirmative vote, elect a successor to hold the office for the unexpired term of the

holders of the shares entitled to elect such director pursuant to Section 4(b) above, as the case may
be, in accordance with California Corporations Code ¬ß 303 and ¬ß 304.

5, Protective Provisions.

6. Redemption.

(a) At any time, and from time to time, after the sixth (6") anniversary of
the Series D Purchase Date, and at the election of the Series D Majority by written notice to the
corporation, the corporation shall redeem, out of funds legally available therefor, subject to the
provisions contained herein, all or any portion of the outstanding shares of Series D Preferred (such
shares to be redeemed, the "Redemption Shares"), on a Redemption Date that shall not be more
than thirty (30) days following the receipt of such written notice. The corporation shal! redeem the
Redemption Shares by paying in cash the aggregate Redemption Price. "Redemption Price" shal!
mean an amount per share equal to the Series D Purchase Price (as adjusted to reflect subsequent
stock dividends, stock splits or recapitalizations), plus a cumulative dividend of six percent (6%) of
the Series D Purchase Price, compounded annually.

(b) If the funds of the corporation legally available for redemption of
Redemption Shares are insufficient to redeem all Redemption Shares, then (without limiting the
corporation's obligation hereunder or curing any failure not to redeem all of the Redemption Shares)
those funds that are legally available will be used to redeem the maximum possible number of
Redemption Shares ratably among the holders thereof in proportion to the aggregate Redemption .
Price that each such holder would be entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 6, Each Redemption
Share not redeemed as and when required hereunder for any reason shall remain outstanding, be
entitled to all the rights and preferences provided herein and, upon redemption, shall entitle the
holder of such Redemption Share to an additional payment (the "Redemption Delay Payment")
equal to the interest that would have accrued on the Redemption Price, since the Redemption Date,
at an annual interest rate equal to (x) the "prime rate" on the first business day following the
Redemption Date, as published in the money rates section of The Wall Street Journal or any
successor publication thereto, plus (y) six percent (6%), provided, that such rate shall not exceed
fourteen percent (14%), compounded quarterly on the last day of each calendar quarter. Thereafter,
until such time as such Redemption Share is redeemed in accordance with this Section 6, such
interest rate shall increase automatically at the end of each succeeding 90 day period by an additional
‚Äòincrement of two (2) percentage points (but in no event shall such interest rate exceed fourteen

19
percent (14%). The Redemption Delay Payment shall be fully paid with funds irrevocably set apart
for payment thereof in all cases before any dividends may be declared or paid with respect to any
shares that are not Redemption Shares. At any time thereafter when additional funds of the
corporation are legally available for the redemption of Redemption Shares, such funds will
immediately be used to redeem the balance of the Redemption Shares (including the payment of the
Redemption Delay Payment on such Redemption Shares) that the corporation has become obliged to
redeem on any proposed Redemption Date but that it has not redeemed, ratably among the holders
thereof in proportion to the remaining aggregate Redemption Price (Redemption Delay Payments)
that each such holder remains entitled to receive. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, without the prior written consent of the Series D Majority, the corporation shall not declare
or pay any dividends or redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire (or pay into or set aside for a
sinking fund for such purpose) any shares that are not Redemption Shares after the receipt of notice
of redemption under this Section 6, or at any other time when the corporation is obligated to make
redemption payments under this Section 6, unless and until all amounts required to be paid to the
holders of Redemption Shares shall have been paid in full.

(c) Any redemption effected pursuant to Section 6(a) shall be made on a
pro rata basis among the holders of the Redemption Shares in proportion to the Redemption Shares
then held by them,

(d) The "Redemption Date" shall mean a date not more than thirty (30)
days following receipt of notice from the Series D Majority of their election to redeem the
Redemption Shares. Within fifteen (15) days after receipt of a redemption request from the Series D
Majority pursuant to Section 6(a) or Section 6(b), written notice shall be mailed, first class postage
prepaid, to each holder of record (at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day
on which notice is given) of the Redemption Shares to be redeemed, at the address last shown on the
records of the corporation for such holder, notifying such holder of the redemption to be effected,
specifying the number and type of shares to be redeemed from such holder, the Redemption Date,
the Redemption Price, the place at which payment may be obtained and calling upon such holder to
surrender to the corporation, in the manner and at the place designated, the holder's certificate or
certificates representing the shares to be redeemed (the "Redemption Notice"). Except as provided
herein, on or after the Redemption Date, each holder of Redemption Shares to be redeemed shall
surrender to this corporation the certificate or certificates representing such shares, in the manner
and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice, and thereupon the Redemption Price of such
shares shall be payable to the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or
certificates as the owner thereof and each surrendered certificate shall be cancelled. In the event less
than all the shares represented by any such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued
representing the unredeemed shares,

(e) From and after the Redemption Date, unless there shall have been a
default in payment of the Redemption Price, all rights of the holders of shares of Series D Preferred
designated for redemption in the Redemption Notice as holders of Series D Preferred (except the
right to receive the Redemption Price without interest upon surrender of their certificate or
certificates) shall cease with respect to the shares designated for redemption on such date, and such
shares shall not thereafter be transferred on the books of the corporation or be deemed to be
outstanding for any purpose whatsoever.

20
(f) On or prior to the Redemption Date, the corporation may deposit the
Redemption Price of all Redemption Shares in the Redemption Notice and not yet redeemed with a
bank or trust corporation having aggregate capital and surplus in excess of $100,000,000, as a trust
fund for the benefit of the respective holders of the Redemption Shares and not yet redeemed, with
irrevocable instructions and authority to the bank or trust corporation to pay the Redemption Price
for such shares to their respective holders on or after the Redemption Date upon receipt of
notification from the corporation that-such holder has surrendered a share certificate to the
corporation pursuant to Section 6(d), As of the Redemption Date, the deposit of the aggregate
Redemption Price shall constitute full payment of the Redemption Shares in the Redemption Notice
to their holders, and from and after the Redemption Date the Redemption Shares so called for in the
Redemption Notice shall be redeemed and shall be deemed to be no longer outstanding, and the
holders thereof shall cease to be shareholders with respect to such shares and shall have no rights
with respect thereto except the right to receive from the bank or trust corporation payment of the
Redemption Price of the Redemption Shares, without interest, upon surrender of their certificates
therefor. Such instructions shall also provide that any monies deposited by the corporation pursuant
to this Section 6(f) for the Redemption Shares in the Redemption Notice thereafter converted into
shares of the corporation's Common Stock pursuant to Section 3 prior to the Redemption Date shall
be returned to the corporation forthwith upon such conversion.

(g) The Redemption Shares shall not be redeemable or otherwise
repurchasable by the corporation or any of its subsidiaries, except as set forth in this Section 6 or as
otherwise agreed to by the Series D Majority.

7. Status of Converted Stock. In the event any shares of Preferred Stock shall be
converted pursuant to Section 3 hereof, the shares so converted shall be canceled and shall not be
issuable by the corporation, and the Articles of Incorporation of the corporation shall be
appropriately amended to effect the corresponding reduction in the corporation's authorized capital
stock.

8. Consent to Certain Distributions. In accordance with Section 500 of the
California Corporations Code, a distribution can be made without regard to any preferential
dividends arrears amount (as defined in Section 500 of the California Corporations Code) or any
preferential rights amount (as defined in Section 500 of the California Corporations Code) in
connection with (i) repurchases of Common Stock issued to or held by employees, officers, directors
or consultants of the corporation or its subsidiaries upon termination of their employment or services
pursuant to agreements providing for the right of said repurchase, (ii) repurchases of Common Stock
issued to or held by employees, officers, directors or consultants of the corporation or its subsidiaries
pursuant to rights of first refusal contained in agreements providing for such right, (ili) repurchases

shareholder, or (iv) any other repurchase or redemption of Common Stock or Preferred Stock
approved by the holders of Preferred Stock of the corporation,
