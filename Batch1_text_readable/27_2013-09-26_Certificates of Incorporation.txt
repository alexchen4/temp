(b) Automatic Conversion.

(i) ‘Qualified Public Offering. Each share of Preferred Stock shall
automatically be converted into fully paid, non-assessable shares of Common Stock at the then effective

Common Stock registered under the Securities Act at a price per share (prior to underwriting commissions
and offering expenses) which reflects a valuation of the Company (before receipt of any proceeds from the
public offering) of at least $100 million and with aggregate net proceeds to the Company of at least $40
million (a “Qualified Public Offering”). In the event of the automatic conversion of the Preferred Stock in
connection with a Qualified Public Offering, the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable
upon such conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock
immediately prior to the closing of such sale and issuance of securities.

(ii) Shareholder Vote. Each share of each series of Preferred Stock shalt
automatically be converted into fully paid, non-assessable shares of Common Stock at the then effective
Conversion Rate for such share immediately upon (A) with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock, the receipt by the Company of a written consent or vote for
such conversion from the holders of at least a majority of the then-outstanding A Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class, (B) with respect to the
Series D Preferred Stock and Series D-1 Preferred Stock, the receipt by the Company of a written consent or

Preferred Stock, the receipt by the Company of a written consent or vote for such conversion from the
holders of at least a majority of the then-outstanding Series E Preferred Stock. In the event of the automatic
conversion of the Preferred Stock by written consent or vote, the person(s) entitled to receive the Common
Stock issuable upon such conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have converted such
Preferred Stock immediately prior the effectiveness of such written consent or vote.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued
upon conversion of the Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would otherwise
be entitled upon conversion of the Preferred Stock by such holder (after all fractional shares arising from
such holder’s conversion have been aggregated into the greatest possible number of whole shares), the
Company shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the then fair market value of such fractional
shares as determined by the Board of Directors. Before any holder of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
convert the same into full shares of Common Stock, and to receive certificates therefor, they shall either
(i) surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Company or of any
transfer agent for the Preferred Stock or (ii) notify the Company or its transfer agent that such certificates
have been lost, stolen or destroyed and execute an agreement satisfactory to the Company to indemnify the
Company from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates, and shall give written notice to
the Company at such office that they elect to convert the same; provided, however, that in the event of an
automatic conversion pursuant to Section 4(b) above, the outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock shall be
converted automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the
certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Company or its transfer agent; provided, further,
that the Company shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon such automatic conversion unless either the certificates evidencing such shares of the
Preferred. Stock are delivered to the Company or its transfer agent as provided above, or the holder notifies
the Company or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an
agreement satisfactory to the Company to indemnify the Company from any loss incurred by it in
connection with such certificates,

6460679_6.D0C , -10-
A074&6094

The Company shall, as soon as practicable after such delivery, or after receipt of such agreement
and indemnification, if any, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of the Preferred Stock, a
certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which the holder shall be entitled as
aforesaid and a check payable to the holder in the amount of any cash amounts payable as the result of a
conversion into fractional shares of Common Stock; plus any declared and unpaid dividends on the
converted Preferred Stock. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the
close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of the Preferred Stock to be converted, and the
person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall] be
treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date;
provided, however, that if the conversion is in connection with a public offering or a Liquidation Event, the
conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering the Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned
upon the closing of the sale of securities pursuant to such public offering, or such Liquidation Event, in
which event the person(s) entitled to receive the: Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of the
Preferred Stock shall not-be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the
closing or consummation of the public offering or Liquidation Event.

otherwise provided in this Section 4(d){i)) be adjusted to a price determined by multiplying the Series A
Conversion Price by a fraction, (x) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such issuance (the “Outstanding Common”) plus the number of shares of
Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received by the Company for such issuance would purchase
at the Series A Conversion Price; and (y) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of

otherwise provided in this Section 4(d)(i)) be adjusted to a price determined by multiplying the Series B
Conversion Price by a fraction, (x) the numerator of which shall be the Outstanding Common plus the
number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received by the Company for such
issuance would purchase at the Series D Conversion Price; and (y) the denominator of which shall be the ©
number of shares of Outstanding Common plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock.

(3) If the Company shal) issue, at any time after the Original Issue
Date, any Additional Stock (as defined below) without consideration or for a consideration per share less
than the Series D Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock, the

otherwise provided in this Section 4(d\i)) be adjusted to a price determined by multiplying the Series C
Conversion Price by a fraction, (x) the numerator of which shal] be the Outstanding Common plus the
number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received by the Company for such
issuance would purchase at the Series D Conversion Price; and (y) the denominator of which shall be the
number of shares of Outstanding Common plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock.

(4) If the Company shall issue, at any time after the Original Issue
Date, any Additional Stock (as defined below) without consideration or for a consideration per share less
than the Series D Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock, the
Series D Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall automatically (except as
otherwise provided in this Section 4(d)(i)) be adjusted to a price determined by multiplying the Series D
Conversion Price by a fraction, (x) the numerator of which shall be the Outstanding Common plus the
number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received by the Company for such
issuance would purchase at the. Series D Conversion Price; and (y) the denominator of which shall be the
number of shares of Outstanding Common plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock.

Date, any Additional Stock (as defined below) without consideration or for a consideration per share less
than the Series D-1 Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock,

(except as otherwise provided in this Section 4(d)(i)) be adjusted to a price determined by multiplying the
Series D-] Conversion Price by a fraction, (x) the numerator of which shall be the Outstanding Common
plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received by the Company for
such issuance would purchase at the Series D-1 Conversion Price; and (y) the denominator of which shall be
the number of shares of Outstanding Common plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock.

(6) If the Company shall issue, at any time after the Original Issue
Date, any Additional Stock (as defined below) without consideration or for a consideration per share less
than the Series E Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock, the
Series E Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall automatically (except as
otherwise provided in this Section 4(d)(i)) be adjusted to a price determined by multiplying the Series E
Conversion Price by a fraction, (x) the numerator of which shall be the Outstanding Common plus the

issuance would purchase at the Series E Conversion Price; and (y) the denominator of which shall be the
number of shares of Outstanding Common plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock.

(B) No adjustment of the applicable Conversion Price shall be made if
the amount of such reduction would be less than $0.01. Except to the limited extent provided for in Sections
4(d)(i)(E)(3) and 4(d)(i)(E)(4), no adjustment of such Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4(d)(i) shall
have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price above the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to
such adjustment.

(C) In the case of the issuance of Additional Stock for cash, the
consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting any reasonable
discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the Company for any underwriting or
otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

(DB) In the case of the issuance of the Additional Stock for a
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be deemed to be the

the conversion or exchange of such securities.

(4) Upon the expiration of any such options or rights, the
termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options or rights related to
such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Conversion Price, to the extent in any way affected by or

different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization,
reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares provided for above), the

the number of shares of Common Stock which the holders would otherwise have been entitled to receive, a
number of shares of such other class or classes of stock equivalent to the number of shares of Common
Stock that would have been subject to receipt by the holders upon conversion of the Preferred Stock

case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 4 with respect
to the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock after the capital reorganization, merger or consolidation to
the end that the provisions of this Section 4 (including adjustment of the Conversion Price then in effect and
the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event
and be as nearly equivalent as practicable.
