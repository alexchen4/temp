GDS VF&H\797059.3 3
2. Liquidation Preference.

(a) In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Company, either voluntary or involuntary, the holders of Series D Preferred Stock, holders of
Series C Preferred Stock and holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive,
prior and in preference to any distribution of any of the assets of the Company to the holders of
the Series A Preferred Stock, Common Stock or other junior equity security of the Company by
reason of their ownership thereof, an amount per share equal to $4.417 for each outstanding
share of Series D Preferred Stock (the “Original Series D Issue Price”), an amount per share
equal to $4.16 for each outstanding share of Series C Preferred Stock (the “Original Series C
Issue Price”) and an amount per share equal to $1.75 for each outstanding share of Series B
Preferred Stock (the “Original Series B Issue Price”) plus all declared but unpaid dividends on
such share (as adjusted for any dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like after
the filing date hereof). If upon the occurrence of such event, the assets and funds thus distributed
among the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and Series B
Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full aforesaid
preferential amounts, then the entire assets and funds of the Company legally available for
distribution shall be distributed ratably among the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock, Series
C Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock in proportion to the full preferential amount of
Series D Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock that each such
holder is otherwise entitled to receive under this subsection (a).

(b) Upon the completion of the distribution required by Section 2(a),
the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any
distribution of any of the assets of the Company to the holders of Common Stock or other junior
equity security of the Company by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount per share equal
to $0.41 for each outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock (the “Original Series A Issue
Price”), plus all declared but unpaid dividends on such share (as adjusted for any dividends,
combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like after the filing date hereof). If upon the
occurrence of such event, the assets and funds thus distributed among the holders of the Series A
Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full aforesaid
preferential amounts, then the entire assets and funds of the Company legally available for
distribution shall be distributed ratably among the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock in
proportion to the amount of such stock owned by each such holder.

(c) | Upon the completion of the distribution required by Sections 2(a)
and 2(b), the entire remaining assets and funds of the Company legally available for distribution,
if any, shall be distributed among the holders of the Common Stock pro rata based on the number
of shares of Common Stock held by each,

(d) _— (i) For purposes of this Section B.2, a liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Company shall be deemed to be occasioned by, or to include, (A) the
acquisition of the Company by another entity by means of any transaction or series of related
transactions (including, without limitation, any reorganization, merger or consolidation but,
excluding any merger effected exclusively for the purpose of changing the domicile of the
Company); (B) a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; unless the
Company’s stockholders of record as constituted immediately prior to such Acquisition (as

GDS VF&EN\797059.3 4
defined below) will, immediately after such Acquisition (by virtue of securities issued as
consideration for the Acquisition or otherwise) hold at least 50% of the voting power of the
surviving or acquiring entity; or (C) an exclusive licensing of all or substantially all of the
Company’s intellectual property to a third party (any such acquisition, sale or licensing described
in clause (A), (B) or (C), an “Acquisition”). In such event, the holders of Preferred Stock and
Common Stock shall be entitled to receive at the closing of such Acquisition in cash, securities
or other property amounts as specified in subsections 2(a), (b) and (c). Notwithstanding the
above, for purposes of determining the amount each holder of shares of Preferred Stock is
entitled to receive with respect to an Acquisition, unless a holder of shares of a series of
Preferred Stock otherwise instructs this corporation in writing prior to the Acquisition, each such
holder shall be deemed to have converted (regardless of whether such holder actually converted)
such holder’s shares of such series into shares of Common Stock immediately prior to the
Liquidation Event if, as a result of an actual conversion, such holder would receive, in the
aggregate, an amount greater than the amount that would be distributed to such holder if such
holder did not convert such series of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock. If any such
holder shall be deemed to have converted shares of Preferred Stock into Common Stock pursuant
to this paragraph, then such holder shall not be entitled to receive any distribution that would
otherwise be made to holders of Preferred Stock that have not converted (or have not been
deemed to have converted) into shares of Common Stock. .

(ii) In any of such events, if the consideration received by the
Company is other than cash, its value will be deemed its fair market value. Any securities shall
be valued as follows:

(A) Securities not subject to investment letter or other
similar restrictions on free marketability:

(1) If traded on a securities exchange or other
last sale reporting system such as The Nasdaq Stock Market, the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange
over the 20 day period ending two (2) days prior to the closing (or such other
period as is set forth in the agreement or agreements setting forth the terms of
such Acquisition);

(2) ‘If actively traded over-the-counter (but not
on a last sale reporting system), the value shall be deemed to be the average of the
closing bid prices over the 20-day period ending two days prior to the closing (or
such other period as is set forth in the agreement or agreements setting forth the
terms of such Acquisition); and

(3) If there is no active public market, the value
shall be the fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Company
and the holders of at least fifty-five percent (55%) of the voting power of all then
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock.

(B) The method of valuation of securities subject to
investment letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising

GDS VF&H\797059.3 5
solely by virtue of a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to
make an appropriate discount, if any, from the market value determined as set forth above
in Section 2(d)(ii)(A) (1), (2) or (3) to reflect the approximate fair market value thereof,
as mutually determined by the Company and the holders of at least fifty-five percent
(55%) of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock.

Giii) In the event the requirements of this subsection 2(d) are not
complied with, the Company shall forthwith either:

(A) cause such closing to be postponed until such time
as the requirements of this Section 2 have been complied with; or

(B) cancel such transaction, in which event the rights,
preferences and privileges of the holders of the Preferred Stock shall revert to and be the
same as such rights, preferences and privileges existing immediately prior to the date of
the first notice referred to in subsection 2(d)(iv) hereof.

(iv) |The Company shall give each holder of record of Preferred
Stock written notice of such impending transaction not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the
stockholders’ meeting called to approve such transaction, or fifteen (15) days prior to the closing
of such transaction, whichever is earlier, and shall also notify such holders in writing of the final
approval of such transaction. The first of such notices shall describe the material terms and
conditions of the impending transaction and the provisions of this Section 2, and the Company
shall thereafter give such holders prompt notice of any material changes. The transaction shall in
no event take place sooner than fifteen (15) days after the Company has given the first notice
provided for herein or sooner than five (5) days after the Company has given notice of any
material changes provided for herein. In connection with any proposed Acquisition transaction,
holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to conditionally convert their shares of Preferred
Stock into such number of shares of Common Stock as provided in Section B.4 of this Article IV
contingent upon the consummation of the Acquisition; it being the intent of this Section that
holders of Preferred Stock be given the opportunity to maximize the return on their investment in
the event that they convert their shares of Preferred Stock into Common Stock and not to require
the holders of Preferred Stock to convert if, for any reason, the Acquisition provided for in the
notice to the holders of Preferred Stock is not consummated.

(v) Shares of Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to be
converted into shares of Common Stock in order to participate in any distribution, or series of
distributions, as shares of Common Stock, without first foregoing participation in the
distribution, or series of distributions, as shares of Preferred Stock.

3. Redemption. The Preferred Stock shall not be redeemable at the option of
the holder.

4. Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion
rights as follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be
convertible at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such

GDS VF&H\797059,3 6
share, at the office of the Company or any transfer agent for Series A Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock or Series D Preferred Stock, as the case may be, into
such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by
dividing the Original Series A Issue Price, Original Series B Issue Price, Original Series C Issue
Price or Original Series D Issue Price, as the case may be (in each case as defined in Section B.2
above) by the Conversion Price applicable to the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred
Stock, Series C Preferred Stock or Series D Preferred Stock, as the case may be, in effect on the
date the certificate is surrendered for conversion. The initial “Conversion Price” per share for
shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be the Original Series A Issue Price, the initial
“Conversion Price” per share for shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be the Original
Series B Issue Price, the initial “Conversion Price” per share for shares of Series C Preferred
Stock shall be the Original Series C Issue Price and the initial “Conversion Price” per share for
shares of Series D Preferred Stock shall be the Original Series D Issue Price; provided, however,
that the Conversion Prices for the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C
Preferred Stock and the Series D Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in
Section 4(d).

(b) Automatic Conversion.

(i) Each share of Series D Preferred Stock and Series C
Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock, at the
Conversion Price at the time in effect for each such series of Preferred Stock, immediately upon
the earlier of (i) except as provided below in subsection 4(c), the closing of the sale by the
Company of Common Stock in a firm commitment underwritten public offering registered under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), other than a registration relating
solely to a transaction under Rule 145 under the Securities Act (or any successor thereto) or to an
employee benefit plan of the Company, that results in gross offering proceeds (before deduction
of underwriters’ discounts and commissions and expenses) to the Company and/or any selling
stockholders of more than $30,000,000 in the aggregate and the per share public offering price of
at least $9.00 (subject to adjustment to reflect subsequent stock dividends, stock splits, stock
combinations or other recapitalizations) (a “Qualified Public Offering”) or (ii) the date specified
by written consent or agreement of the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding
shares of Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class
and not as separate series and on an as-converted basis).

(ii) Each share of Series B Preferred Stock and Series A
Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock, at the
Conversion Price at the time in effect for each such series of Preferred Stock, immediately upon
the earlier of (i) except as provided below in subsection 4(c), the closing of the sale by the
Company of Common Stock in a firm commitment underwritten public offering registered under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), other than a registration relating
solely to a transaction under Rule 145 under the Securities Act (or any successor thereto) or to an
employee benefit plan of the Company, that results in gross offering proceeds (before deduction
of underwriters’ discounts and commissions and expenses) to the Company and/or any selling
stockholders of more than $30,000,000 in the aggregate and the per share public offering price of
at least $9.00 (subject to adjustment to reflect subsequent stock dividends, stock splits, stock
combinations or other recapitalizations) or (i1) the date specified by written consent or agreement

GDS VF&H\797059.3 7
of the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock
and Series A Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class and not as separate series and on
an as-converted basis).

(c) Mechanics of Conversion.

(i) Before any holder of a series of Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the
certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Company or of any transfer
agent for such series of Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the Company at its
principal corporate office, of the election to convert the same and shall state therein the name or
names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued;
provided, however, that in the event of an automatic conversion pursuant to subsection 4(b), the
outstanding shares of such series of Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically without any
further action by the holder of such shares and whether or not the certificate representing such
shares is surrendered to the Company or its transfer agent; provided, further, however, that the
Company shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon such automatic conversion unless either the certificates evidencing such shares of
Preferred Stock are delivered to the Company or its transfer agent as provided above, or the
holder notifies the Company or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or
destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Company to indemnify the Company
from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates. The Company shall, as soon as
practicable after the surrender by a holder of the certificate representing shares of the Preferred
Stock in accordance with this subsection 4(c), issue and deliver at such office to such holder of
such series of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or
certificates, for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as
aforesaid. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of
business on the date of such surrender of the shares of such series of Preferred Stock to be
converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable
upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such
shares of Common Stock as of such date.

(ii) If the conversion is in connection with an underwritten
offering of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act, the conversion may, at the option
of any holder tendering shares of such series of Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned
upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering, in
which event the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion
of such series of Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such shares of such
series of Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities.

(iii) If the conversion occurs through the vote of the holders of
at least a majority of the shares of one or more classes of Preferred Stock then outstanding
(voting together as a single class and not as a separate series and on an as-converted basis), such
conversion shall be deemed to have been made at the close of business on the day written notice
of such election has been received by the Company, and the person or persons entitled to receive
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the
record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date. Until certificates for

GDSVF&H\797059.3 8
such shares of Preferred Stock of the applicable classes that have been converted have been
delivered to the Company for exchange for certificates representing shares of Common Stock,
such certificates shall be deemed to represent the shares of Common Stock into which such
shares of the applicable classes of Preferred Stock have been converted.

(d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock for Certain
Dilutive Issuances, Splits and Combinations. The Conversion Price of the Series A Preferred
Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock, the Series C Preferred Stock and the Series D Preferred
Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

(i) (A) If the Company shall issue, after the date upon
which any share of Series D Preferred Stock was first issued (the “Purchase Date”), any
Additional Stock (as defined below) without consideration or for a consideration per share less
than the Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C
Preferred Stock and/or Series D Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to the issuance of
such Additional Stock, the Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred
Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and/or Series D Preferred Stock, as appropriate, in effect
immediately prior to each such issuance shall forthwith (except as otherwise provided in this
clause (i)) be adjusted to a price determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction,
the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the
aggregate consideration received by the Company for such issuance would purchase at such
Conversion Price; and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares of such Additional
Stock. For the purpose of the foregoing calculation, the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such issuance shall be calculated on a fully diluted basis, as if
all shares of Preferred Stock and all other securities convertible into or exchangeable for
Common Stock (“Convertible Securities”) had been fully converted into shares of Common
Stock immediately prior to such issuance and any currently exercisable warrants, options or other
rights for the purchase of shares of stock or convertible securities had been fully exercised
immediately prior to such issuance (and the resulting securities fully converted into shares of
Common Stock, if so convertible), but not including in such calculation any additional shares of
Common Stock issuable with respect to shares of Preferred Stock, Convertible Securities, or
currently exercisable options, warrants or other rights for the purchase of shares of stock or
Convertible Securities, solely as a result of the adjustment of such Conversion Price (or other
conversion ratios) resulting from the issuance of Additional Stock causing such adjustment.

(B) No adjustment of the Conversion Price for Preferred
Stock shall be made in an amount less than one cent per share, provided that any
adjustments which are not required to be made by reason of this sentence shall be carried
forward and shall be either taken into account in any subsequent adjustment made prior to
three years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward,
or shall be made at the end of three years from the date of the event giving rise to the
adjustment being carried forward. Except to the limited extent provided for in
subsections 4(d)(i)(E)G) and 4(d)(@)(E)(4) below, no adjustment of such Conversion
Price for such series of Preferred Stock pursuant to this subsection 4(d)(i) shall have the
effect of increasing the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock above the

GDS VF&HN\797059.3 9
GDS VF&H\797059.3

Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such
adjustment.

(C) In the case of the issuance of Common Stock for
cash, the consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before
deducting any reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or
incurred by the Company for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the
issuance and sale thereof.

(D) In the case of the issuance of the Common Stock for
a consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall
be deemed to be the fair value thereof as determined by the Board of Directors
irrespective of any accounting treatment.

(E) In the case of the issuance (whether before, on or
after the applicable Purchase Date) of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for
Common Stock, Convertible Securities, or options to purchase or rights to subscribe for
Convertible Securities, the following provisions shall apply for all purposes of this
subsection 4(d)(i) and subsection 4(d)(ii):

(1) The aggregate maximum number of shares
of Common Stock deliverable upon exercise (assuming the satisfaction of any
conditions to exercisability, including without limitation, the passage of time, but
without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) of such options to
purchase or rights to subscribe for Common Stock shall be deemed to have been
issued at the time such options or rights were issued and for a consideration equal
to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in subsections 4(d)(i)(C)
and 4(d)(i)(D)), if any, received by the Company upon the issuance of such
options or rights plus the minimum exercise price provided in such options or
rights (without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) for the
Common Stock covered thereby.

(2) The aggregate maximum number of shares
of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of or in exchange (assuming the
satisfaction of any conditions to convertibility or exchangeability, including,
without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account potential
antidilution adjustments) for any such Convertible Securities or upon the exercise
of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such Convertible Securities and
subsequent conversion or exchange thereof shall be deemed to have been issued at
the time such securities were issued or such options or rights were issued and for
a consideration equal to the consideration, if any, received by the Company for
any such securities and related options or rights (excluding any cash received on
account of accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the minimum additional
consideration, if any, to be received by the Company (without taking into account
potential antidilution adjustments) upon the conversion or exchange of such
securities or the exercise of any related options or rights (the consideration in each

10
case to be determined in the manner provided in subsections 4(d)(i)(C) and

4(d))@)).

(3) In the event of any change in the number of
shares of Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to the
Company upon exercise of such options or rights or upon conversion of or in
exchange for such Convertible Securities, including, but not limited to, a change
resulting from the antidilution provisions thereof, the Conversion Price of such
series of Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using
such options, rights or securities, shall be recomputed to reflect such change, but
no further adjustment shall be made for the actual issuance of Common Stock or
any payment of such consideration upon the exercise of any such options or rights
or the conversion or exchange of such securities; provided, however, that this
subsection shall not have any effect on any conversion of such series of Preferred
Stock prior to such change or increase.

(4) Upon the expiration of any such options or
rights, the termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration
of any options or rights related to such Convertible Securities, the Conversion
Price of such series of Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or
computed using such options, rights or securities or options or rights related to

(G) — shares of Common Stock issued or issuable as a

(H) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable upon

public offering before or in connection with which all outstanding shares of Preferred

after the Purchase Date fix a record date for the effectuation of a split or subdivision of

the outstanding shares of Common Stock or the determination of holders of Common Stock
entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock
or other securities or rights convertible into, or entitling the holder thereof to receive directly or
indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock (hereinafter referred to as “Common Stock

GDS VE&H\797059.3

12
Equivalents”) without a corresponding subdivision, dividend or other distribution to holders of
Preferred Stock and without payment of any consideration by such holder for the additional
shares of Common Stock or the Common Stock Equivalents (including the additional shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof), then, as of such record date (or the
date of such dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no record date is fixed), the Conversion
Price of each series of Preferred Stock shall be appropriately decreased so that the number of
shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be increased
in proportion to such increase of the aggregate of shares of Common Stock outstanding and those
issuable with respect to such Common Stock Equivalents with the number of shares issuable
with respect to Common Stock Equivalents determined from time to time in the manner provided
for deemed issuance, in subsection 4(d){i)(E).

(iv) If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at
any time after the Purchase Date is decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock and without a corresponding combination of the outstanding shares of Preferred
Stock, then, following the record date of such combination, the Conversion Price for each series
of Preferred Stock shall be appropriately increased so that the number of shares of Common
Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be decreased in proportion to such
decrease in outstanding shares.

(v) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
operation of, and any adjustment of the Conversion Prices pursuant to, the provisions of
subsection 4(d)(i) may be waived with respect to any specific share or shares of Preferred Stock,
either prospectively or retroactively and either generally or in a particular instance by a writing
executed by the registered holder of such share or shares. Any waiver pursuant to this
subsection 4(d)(v) shall bind all future holders of the shares of Preferred Stock for which rights
have been waived. In the event that a waiver of adjustment of Conversion Price under this
subsection 4(d)(v) results in different Conversion Prices for shares of a series of Preferred Stock,
the Secretary of this company shall maintain a written ledger identifying the Conversion Price
for each share of such series of Preferred Stock. Such information shall be made available to any
person upon request.

(e) Other Distributions. In the event the Company shall declare a
distribution payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by the
Company or other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred to
in subsection 4(d)(iii), without a corresponding distribution to the Preferred Stock, then, in each
such case for the purpose of this subsection 4(e), the holders of the Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to a proportionate share of any such distribution as though they were the holders of the
number of shares of Common Stock into which their shares of Preferred Stock are convertible as
of the record date fixed for the determination of the holders of Common Stock entitled to receive
such distribution.

(f) Recapitalizations and Reorganizations.

(i) If at any time or from time to time there shall be a
recapitalization or reorganization of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision, combination
or merger or sale of assets transaction provided for elsewhere in this subsection 4 or

GDS VF&EN797059.3 13
subsection 2) provision shall be made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock shall thereafter
be entitled to receive, upon conversion thereof, the number of shares of stock or other securities
or property of the Company or otherwise, to which a holder of Common Stock deliverable upon
conversion would have been entitled on such recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate
adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this subsection 4 with respect to
the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock after the recapitalization or reorganization to the
end that the provisions of this subsection 4 (including adjustment of the Conversion Price then in
effect and the number of shares purchasable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be
applicable after that event as nearly equivalent as may be practicable.

(ii) If any consolidation or merger of the Company with
another company or entity shall be effected, then, as a condition of such consolidation or merger,
lawful and adequate provision shall be made whereby the holders of the Preferred Stock shall
thereafter have the right to receive, upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified
herein, and in lieu of the shares of Common Stock immediately theretofore receivable upon the
conversion of the Preferred Stock, such shares of stock, securities or assets as may be issued or
payable in connection with such consolidation or merger with respect to or in exchange for a
number of outstanding shares of Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock immediately prior to such consolidation or
merger. In any such case, appropriate provision shall be made with respect to the rights and
interests of the holders of the Preferred Stock to the end that the provisions hereof (including,
without limitation, provisions for adjustment of the each applicable Conversion Price) shall
thereafter be applicable, as nearly as may be practicable, in relation to any shares of stock,
securities or assets thereafter deliverable upon the exercise of such conversion rights. Except as
expressly set forth in this subsection (ii), nothing in this subsection 4(f)(ii) will be deemed to
restrict the Company from entering into a consolidation or merger.

(g) No Impairment. Without the appropriate vote of the stockholders
under the General Corporation Law or Section 6 of this Article IV(B), the Company will not, by
amendment of its certificate of incorporation or through any reorganization, recapitalization,
transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other
voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be
observed or performed hereunder by the Company, but will at all times in good faith assist in the
carrying out of all the provisions of this subsection 4 and in the taking of all such action as may
be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the Conversion Rights of the holders of the
Preferred Stock against impairment.

(h) NoFractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments.

(i) No fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of
any share or shares of the Preferred Stock, and the number of shares of Common Stock to be
issued shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share and the Company shall pay in cash the
fair market value of any fractional shares as of the time when entitlement to receive such
fractions is determined. Whether or not fractional shares are issuable upon such conversion shall
be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock the holder is at the
time converting into Common Stock and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
such aggregate conversion.

GDS VF&H\797059.3 14
(ii) | Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of
the Conversion Price of Preferred Stock pursuant to this subsection 4, the Company, at its
expense, shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms
hereof and prepare and furnish to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such
adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or
readjustment is based. The Company shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of
Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth
(A) such adjustment and readjustment, (B) the consideration received or deemed to be received
by the Company for any Additional Stock issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold,
(C) the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock at the time in effect, and (D) the
number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time
would be received upon the conversion of a share of Preferred Stock.

(i) Notices _of Record Date. In the event of any taking by the
Company of a record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the
holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend) or other
distribution, any right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of stock of any
class or any other securities or property, to receive any other right, or to exchange their shares of
Common Stock, Preferred Stock (or other securities) for securities or other property deliverable
upon a reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, dissolution, liquidation or winding
up, the Company shall mail to each holder of Preferred Stock, at least 5 days prior to the date
specified therein, a notice specifying the date on which any such record is to be taken for the
purpose of such dividend, distribution, right or other exchange, and the amount and character of
such dividend, distribution, right or other exchange.

(j) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Company
shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common

Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of all outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock
such number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect such
conversion; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock
shall not be sufficient to effect such conversion, in addition to such other remedies as shall be
available to the holder of such Preferred Stock, the Company will take such corporate. action as
may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of
Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including,
without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any
necessary amendment to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

(k) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this subsection 4
to be given to the holders of shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed given if deposited in the
United States mail, three (3) days after having been sent by registered or certified mail, return
receipt requested, postage prepaid, and addressed to each holder of record at his address
appearing on the books of the Company.

5. Noting Rights.

(a) Voting Other than for Directors. Except as required by law and in
subsection 5(b) below, the holder of each share of Preferred Stock shall have the right to one
vote for each share of Common Stock into which such Preferred Stock could be converted on the
record date for the vote or consent of stockholders, and, except as otherwise required by law,
with respect to such vote, such holder shall have full voting rights and powers equal to the voting
rights and powers of the holders of Common Stock. The holder of each share of Preferred Stock
shall be entitled, notwithstanding any provision hereof, to notice of any stockholders’ meeting in
accordance with the bylaws of the Company, and shall be entitled to vote with holders of
Common Stock upon the election of directors except as set forth in subsection 5(b) below and
upon any other matter submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Company, except as to those
matters required by law or this certificate of incorporation to be submitted to a class vote.
Fractional votes shall not, however, be permitted and any fractional voting rights available on an
as-converted basis (after aggregating all shares into which shares of Preferred Stock held by each
holder could be converted) shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number.

(b) Voting for Directors.

(i) With respect to the election of members of the Board of
Directors, (i) so long as at least five hundred thousand (500,000) shares of Series A Preferred
Stock are outstanding {as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations and the
like), one (1) member of the Board of Directors shall be elected by the holders of a majority of
the Series A Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class (the “Series A Director”), (ii) so long as
at least five hundred thousand (500,000) shares of Series B Preferred Stock are outstanding (as
adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations and the like), one (1) member of
the Board of Directors shall be elected by the holders of a majority of the Series B Preferred
Stock, voting as a separate class (the “Series B Director”), (iii) so long as at least five hundred
thousand (500,000) shares of Series C Preferred Stock are outstanding (as adjusted for stock
splits, stock dividends, stock combinations and the like), one (1) member of the Board of
Directors shall be elected by the holders of a majority of the Series C Preferred Stock, voting as a
separate class (the “Series C Director”), (iv) one (1) member of the Board of Directors shall be
elected by the holders of a majority of the Common Stock, voting as a separate class (the
“Common Director”), and (v) one (1) member of the Board of Directors shall be elected by the

class and on as as-converted basis (the “Joint Director”).

(ii) | The Series A Director may be removed from the Board of
Directors, either with or without cause, only by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority
of the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock; the Series B Director may be removed from the
Board of Directors, either with or without cause, only by the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding Series B Preferred Stock; the Series C Director may be removed
from the Board of Directors, either with or without cause, only by the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding Series C Preferred Stock; the Common Director may be
removed from the Board of Directors, either with or without cause, only by the affirmative vote
of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Common Stock; and the Joint Director may be
removed from the Board of Directors, either with or without cause, only by the affirmative vote

GDSVF&M\797059,3 16
of the holders of a majority of the Preferred Stock and Common Stock, voting together as a
single class and on an as-converted basis.

(iii) If a vacancy on the Board of Directors is to be filled by the
Board of Directors, only a director or directors elected by the same class of stockholders as those
who would be entitled to vote to fill such vacancy, if any, shall vote to fill such vacancy. If there
are no such directors, such vacancy shall be filled by the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the shares of that same class of stockholders as those who would be entitled to vote
to fill such vacancy.

(iv) No person entitled to vote at an election for directors may
cumulate votes to which such person is entitled, unless, at the time of such election, the
Company is subject to Section 2115 of the California General Corporation Law (“CGCL”).

stockholder entitled to vote at an election for directors may cumulate such stockholder’s votes
and give one candidate a number of votes equal to the number of directors to be elected
multiplied by the number of votes to which such stockholder’s shares are otherwise entitled, or
distribute the stockholder’s votes on the same principle among as many candidates as such
stockholder desires. No stockholder, however, shall be entitled to so cumulate such
stockholder’s votes unless (i) the names of such candidate or candidates have been placed in
nomination prior to the voting and (ii) the stockholder has given notice at the meeting, prior to
the voting, of such stockholder’s intention to cumulate such stockholder’s votes. If any
stockholder has given proper notice to cumulate votes, all stockholders may cumulate their votes
for any candidates who have been properly placed in nomination. Under cumulative voting, the
candidates receiving the highest number of votes, up to the number of directors to be elected, are
elected.

Section 2115(b) of the CGCL, the Board or any individual director may be removed from office
at any time without cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the
outstanding shares entitled to vote; provided, however, that unless the entire Board is removed,
no individual director may be removed when the votes cast against such director’s removal, or
not consenting in writing to such removal, would be sufficient to elect that director if voted
cumulatively at an election which the same total number of votes were cast (or, if such action is
taken by written consent, all shares entitled to vote were voted) and the entire number of
directors authorized at the time of such director’s most recent election were then being elected.
