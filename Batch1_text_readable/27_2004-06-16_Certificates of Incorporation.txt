annum on each outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock, when, as and if declared by the Board of
Directors of the Company (the “Board of Directors”); provided, however, that the Board of Directors is

distribution shall be distributed ratably among the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock in proportion to
the aggregate Liquidation Preference, plus all declared and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred
Stock, for the shares of such Series A Preferred Stock owned by each such holder.

(6) _ Distribution after Payment of Liquidation Preference. After the payments to the
holders of Series A Preferred Stock of the full preferential amounts specified above, the entire remaining
assets of the Company legally available for distribution by the Company shall be distributed ratably among
the holders of Common Stock in proportion to the numbers of shares of Common Stock held by them.

(c) Deemed Liquidation. For purposes of this Section 3, unless otherwise agreed by
holders of at least 2 majority of the then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, voting together as a
single class, a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company shall be deemed to be occasioned by,
or to include: (a) a merger or consolidation of the Company with or into any other entity or entities (but
excluding any merger effected solely for the purpose of reincorporating into another state) or the merger of
any other entity or entities into the Company, in either case in which the shareholders of the Company
recejve distributions in cash or securities of another entity or entities as a result of such consolidation or
merger, and in which the shareholders of the Company, immediately prior t6 such merger or consolidation,
hold, immediately after such merger or consolidation, less than a majority of the outstanding voting
securities of the surviving or successor entity or its parent, or (b) a sale, lease or other conveyance of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Company (each of (2) and (b), an “Acquisition or "),

2786367_5.DOC . -4-

shareholders, any publicly-traded securities to be distributed to shareholders in a liquidation, dissolution, or
winding up of the Company shal] be valued as follows:

(i) __ If the securities are then traded on a national securities exchange or the
Nasdaq Stock Market (or a similar national quotation system), then the value of the securities shall be
deemed to be to the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange or system over the ten
(10) trading day period ending five (5) trading days prior to the distribution;

Gi) if the securities are actively traded over-the-counter, then the value of the
securities shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid prices of the securities over the ten (30)
trading day period ending five (5) trading days prior to the distribution.

(iii) _In the event of a merger or other acquisition of the Company by another
entity, the distribution date shall be deemed to be the date such transaction closes.

system on which the securities to be distributed are traded is open and “closi ices” or “closing bid
prices” shall be deemed to be: (i) for securities traded primarily on the New York Stock Exchange, the
American Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, the last reported trade price or sale price, as the case may be, at 4:00
p.m., New York time, on that day and (ii) for securities listed or traded on other exchanges, markets and
systems, the market price as of the end of the regular hours trading period that is generally accepted as such
for such exchange, market or system. If, after the date hereof, the benchmark times generally accepted in
the securities industry for determining the market price of a stock as of a given treding day shall change
from those set forth above, the fair market value shall be determined as of such other generally accepted
benchmark times.

4, Conversion. The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as
follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at
the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share at the office of the
Company or any transfer agent for the Series A Preferred Stock, into that number of fully-paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock that is equal to the Original Issue Price divided by the appropriate
Conversion Price. The initial Conversion Price (the “Conversion Price”) per share of Series A Preferred
Stock shal] be the Original Issue Price and shall be subject to adjustment as provided herein. The number of
shares of Common Stock into which each share of Series A Preferred Stock may be converted is hereinafter
referred to as the “Conversion Rate.” Upon any decrease or increase in the Conversion Price for a share of
Series A Preferred Stock, as described in this Section 4, the corresponding Conversion Rate for such share
of Series A Preferred Stock shall be appropriately increased or decreased.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall automatically
be converted into fully paid, non-assessable shares of Common Stock at the then effective Conversion Rate
for such share immediately upon the earlier of (i) the consummation of an underwritten public offering of
Common Stock registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, at a price per share (prior to
underwriting commissions and offering expenses) which reflects a valuation of the Company (before receipt
of any proceeds from the public offering) of at least $100 million and with aggregate net proceeds to the
Company of at least $25 million (a “Qualified Public Offering”) or (ii) the receipt by the Company of a
written request for such conversion from the holders of a majority of the Series A Preferred Stock then
outstanding, or, if later, the effective date for conversion specified in such requests, voting together as a
single class, .

2786367_$.DOC “5.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued
upon conversion of Series A Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would
otherwise be entitled upon conversion of Series A Preferred Stock by such holder (after all fractional shares
arising from such holder’s conversion have been aggregated into the greatest possible number of whole
shares), the Company shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the then fair market value of such
fractional shares as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company. Before any holder of Series A
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into’ full shares of Common Stock, and to receive
certificates therefor, they shall either (i) surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the
office of the Company or of any transfer agent for the Series A Preferred Stock or (ii) notify the Company or
its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and execute an agreement
satisfactory to the Company to indemnify the Company from any loss incurred by it in connection with such
certificates, and shall give written notice to the Company at such office that they elect to convert the same;
provided, however, that in the event of an automatic conversion pursuant to Section 4(b) above, the
outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically without any further action
by the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to
the Company or its transfer agent; provided, further, that the Company shall not be obligated to issue
certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such automatic conversion unless either
the certificates evidencing such shares of Series A Preferred Stock are delivered to the Company or its
transfer agent as provided above, or the holder notifies the Company or its transfer agent that such
certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Company to
indemnify the Company from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates.

The Company shall, es soon as practicable after such delivery, or after receipt of such agreement
and indemnification, if any, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Series A Preferred Stock, a
certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which the holder shall be entitled as
aforesaid and a check payable to the holder in the amount of any cash amounts payable as the result of a
conversion into fractional shares of Common Stock, plus any declared and unpaid dividends on the
converted Series A Preferred Stock. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior
to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be
converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such
conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock
on such date; provided, however, that if the conversion is in connection with a public offering or a
Liquidation Event, the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering Series A Preferred Stock for
conversion, be conditioned upon the closing of the sale of securities pursuant to such public offering, or such
Liquidation Event, in which event the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such
conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Series A Preferred
Stock until immediately prior to the closing or consummation of the public offering or Liquidation Event.

(a) Conversion Price Adjustments for Sales of Shares Below Conversion Price. The
Conversion Price of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as
follows: .

(i) (A) If the Company shall issue, after the Original Issue Date, any
Additional Stock (as defined below) without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the
Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock, the Conversion Price
in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall automatically (except as otherwise provided in this
Section 4(d)(i)) be adjusted to a price determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, (x) the
numerator of which sliall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such
issuance (the “Outstanding Common”) plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate
consideration received by the Company for such issuance would purchase at such Conversion Price; and
(y) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Outstanding Common plus the number of

2786367_5.D0C -6-
shares of such Additional Stock. For purposes of the foregoing calculation, the term “Outstanding
Common” shall include all shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock.

(B) No adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made if the amount
of such reduction would be less than $0,01. Except to the limited extent provided for in Sections
4(d\iXE)(3) and 4(d)i)(E)(4), no adjustment of such Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4(d)(i) shall
have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price above the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to
such adjustment.

(C) In the case of the issuance of Additional Stock for cash, the
consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting any reasonable
discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the Company for any underwriting or
otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

(D) In the case of the issuance of the Additional Stock for a
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be deemed to be the
fair market value thereof as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors irrespective of any
accounting treatment.

(E) In the case of the issuance (whether before, on or after the
applicable Original Issue Date) of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common Stock, securities
by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock or options to purchase or rights to
subscribe for such convertible or exchangeable securities, the following provisions shall apply for all
purposes of this Section 4(d){i) and Section 4(d ii):

(1) The aggregate maximum number of shares of Common
Stock deliverable upon exercise (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to exercisability, including
without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments
affecting such stock) of such securities, options to purchase, or rights to subscribe for Common Stock shall
be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities, options or rights were issued and for a
consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in Sections 4(d){i(C) and
4(d)(i}(D)), if any, received by the Company upon the issuance of such securities, options or rights plus the
minimum exercise price provided in such securities, options or rights (without taking into account potential
antidilution adjustments affecting such stock) for the Common Stock covered thereby.

(2) The aggregate maximum number of shares of Common
Stock deliverable upon conversion of or in exchange (assuming the satisfection of any conditions to
convertibility or exchangeability, including, without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into
account potential antidilution adjustments affecting such stock) for any such convertible or exchangeable
securities or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or
exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof shall be deemed to have been issued
at the time such securities were issued or such options or rights were issued and for a consideration equal to
the consideration, if any, received by the Company for any such securities and related options or rights
(excluding any cash received by the Company on account of accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the
minimum additional consideration, if any, to be received by the Company (without taking into account
potential antidilution adjustments affecting such stock) upon the conversion or exchange of such securities
or the exercise of any related options or rights (the consideration in each case to be determined in the
manner provided in Sections 4(d)(iX(C) and 4(d\{i)(D)).

2786367_5.DOC -7-
(3) In the event of any change in the number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to the Company upon exercise of such options or
rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such convertible or exchangeable securities (excluding a
change resulting from any antidilution provisions contained in such options, rights or securities), the
Conversion Price, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, rights or securities,
shall be recomputed to reflect such change, but no further adjustment shall be made for the actual issuance
of Common Stock or any payment of such consideration upon the exercise of any such options or rights or
the conversion or exchange of such securities.

(4) Upon the expiration of any such options or rights, the
termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options or rights related to
such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Conversion Price, to the extent in any way affected by or
computed using such options, rights or securities or options or rights related to such securities, shall be
recomputed to reflect the issuance of only the number of shares of Common Stock (and convertible or
exchangeable securities which remain in effect) actually issued upon the exercise of such options or rights,
upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or upon the exercise of the options or rights related to
such securities.

(5) The number of shares of Common Stock deemed issued
and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to Sections 4(d)(i)(E)(1) and (2) shall be appropriately
adjusted to reflect any change, termination or expiration of the type described in either Section 4(d)(i)(E)(3)
or (4).

(ii) “Additional Stock” shall mean all shares of Common Stock issued (or
deemed to have been issued pursuant to Section 4(d)(i)(E)) by the Company after the Original Issue Date)
other

(A) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable to employees, officers
or directors of, or consultants or advisors to, the Company or any subsidiary pursuant to stock purchase or

lessors or other financial institutions pursuant to a debt financing or commercial credit or leasing
arrangement approved by the Board of Directors;

(D) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable upon conversion of
Series A Preferred Stock; and

€) shares of Common Stock issued in connection with strategic
transactions that include a commercial relationship involving the Company and other entities, including
(i) joint ventures, manufacturing, marketing or distribution arrangements, or (ii) technology transfer,
licensing or development arrangements; provided that such issuances have been approved by the Board of

TS.
. {e) Adinetments to Conversion Price for Certain Combinations, Distributions,
Rec cations and s. The Conversion Price shal] be subject to adjustment from time to

time as follows:

2786367_$.DOC -8-
(i) Adjustments for Subdivisions, Combinations or Consolidations of Common
Stock. In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shali be subdivided (by stock split, stock
dividend, or otherwise) into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such subdivision shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such subdivision, be
proportionately decreased. In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined or
consolidated (by reclassification, reverse stock split or otherwise) into a lesser number of shares of Common
Stock, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such combination or consolidation shall,
concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination or consolidation, be proportionately increased.

(ii) Adjustments for Other Distributions. In the event the Company at any time
or from time to time makes or fixes a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled

to receive any Distribution payable in securities of the Company, then and in each such event provision shall
be made so that the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall receive upon such Distribution the amount of
securities of the Company which they would have received had their Series A Preferred Stock converted
into Common Stock on the date of such event and had they thereafter, during the period from the date of
such event to and including the date of conversion, retained such securities receivable by them as aforesaid
during such period, subject to all other adjustments called for during such period under this Section 4 with
respect to the sights of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock. ,

(iii) justments for Reclassificatj change and Substitution. If the
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or
a different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization,
reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares provided for above), the
Conversion Price then in effect shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such reorganization or
reclassification, be proportionately adjusted such that the Series A Preferred Stock shall be convertible into,
in lieu of the number of shares of Common Stock which the holders would otherwise have been entitled to
receive, a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock equivalent to the number of shares of
Common: Stock that would have been subject to receipt by the holders upon conversion of the Series A
Preferred Stock immediately before that change.

(iv)  Reorganizations, Mereers or Consolidations. If at any time or from time to
time, there is a capital reorganization of the Common Stock or the merger or consolidation of the Company
with or into another corporation or another entity or person (other than an Acquisition or Asset Transfer as
defined in Section 3(c) or a recapitalization, subdivision, combination, reclassification, exchange or
substitution of shares provided for elsewhere in this Section 4), as a part of such capital reorganization,
merger or consolidation, provision shall be made so that the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall
thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock held by them the number of
shares of stock or other securities or property to which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock
deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled on such capital reorganization, merger or
consolidation. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shal] be made in the application of the provisions of
this Section 4 with respect to the rights of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock ‘after the capital
reorganization, merger or consolidation to the end that the provisions of this Section 4 (including adjustment
of the Conversion Price then in effect and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Series A
Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event and be ss nearly equivalent as practicable.

(f) Certificate_as_ to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of any Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4, the Company at its expense shall compute
such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to each holder of Series A
Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts
upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Company shall, upon the written request of any
holder of Series A Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting

2786367_$.DOC -9-

forth (i) such adjustments and readjustments, (ii) the Conversion Prices at the time in effect, and (iii) the
number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be
received upon the conversion of Series A Preferred Stock.

(g) Waiver of Adjustment of Conversion Price. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, any downward adjustment of the Conversion Price of the Series A Preferred Stock may be waived,
either prospectively or retroactively and either generally or in a particular instance, by the consent or vote of
the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock. Any such
waiver shall bind all future holders of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock.

(h) Notices of Record Date. In the event that the Company shall propose at any time:

(i) to declare any dividend or Distribution upon its Common Stock, whether in
cash, property, stock or other securities, whether or not a regular cash dividend and whether or not out of
earnings or earned surplus;

(ii) to offer for subscription pro rata to the holders of any class or series of its
stock (other than pursuant to contractual agreements entered into with each such holder) any additional
shares of stock of any class or series or any other securities or property, or to receive any other rights;

(iii) to effect any reclassification or recapitalization of its Common Stock
outstanding involving a change in the Common Stock; or

(iv) to merge or consolidate with or into any other corporation, or sell, lease or
convey all or substantially all its property or business, or to liquidate, dissolve or wind up (other than in
