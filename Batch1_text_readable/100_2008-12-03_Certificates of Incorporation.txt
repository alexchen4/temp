them equal to the sum of (i) $5.72 for such share of Series D Preferred (as adjusted for any stock
splits, stock dividends, combinations, subdivisions, recapitalizations or the like) and (ii) all declared
and unpaid dividends on such share of Series D Preferred. If upon a Liquidation Event, the assets of
the corporation legally available for distribution to the holders of the Series D Preferred arc
insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full amounts specified in this Section 2(a),
then the entire assets of the corporation legally available for distribution shall be distributed with
equal priority and pro rata among the holders of the Series D Preferred in proportion to the full
amounts they would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2(a).

(d) Deemed Conversion, Notwithstanding the above, for purposes of determining the
amount each holder of shares of Preferred Stock is entitled to receive with respect to a dissolution,

actually converted) such holder's shares of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock

an actual conversion, such holder would receive, in the aggregate, an amount greater than the
amount that would be distributed to such holder if such holder did not convert such shares of
Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock. If any such holder shall be deemed to have converted
shares of Preferred Stock into Common Stock pursuant to this Section 2(d), then such holder shall
not be entitled to receive any distribution that would otherwise be made to holders of Preferred Stock

consolidation or otherwise), in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to a person or group
of affiliated persons (other than an underwniter of this corporation’s securities), of this corporation's
securities if, after such closing, such person or group of affiliated persons would hold fifty percent
(50%) or more of the outstanding voting stock of this corporation (or the surviving or acquiring
entity).

(f) Noncash Distributions. Any securities or other property to be delivered to the
holders of the Preferred Stock and Common Stock upon a Liquidation Event shall be valued as
follows:

(i) | Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar restrictions

(2) if actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be deemed to be
the average of the closing bid prices (or closing sales prices, whichever is applicable) over the
30-day period ending three (3) business days prior to the closing; and

(3) if there is no active public market, the value shall be the fair
market value thereof as mutually determined by the corporation and the holders of at Icast 66 2/3%

other restrictions on free marketability shall be to make an appropriate discount from the market
value determined as provided in Sections 2(f)(i)(1), (2) or (3) to reflect the approximate fair market
value thereof, as mutually determined by the corporation and the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock.

distnbuted in connection with a Liquidation Event may be superseded by any determination of such
value set forth in the definitive agreements governing such Liquidation Event.

(v) If the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding shares of the
Preferred Stock and the corporation are unable to reach agreement on any valuation matter, such
valuation shall be submitted to and determined by a nationally recognized independent investment

the outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock (or, if such selection cannot be made, by a nationally
recognized independent investment banking firm selected by the American Arbitration Association

General Corporation Law shal] not apply in whole or in part.

3. Voting Rights.

Common Stock into which each share of Preferred Stock could be converted pursuant to Section 4
hereof at the record date for the determination of the stockholders entitled to vote on such matters or,

together as a single class and not as separate series, and on an as-converted basis) shall be entitled to
elect any remaining directors of this corporation.

(il) Vacancies in the Board of Directors may be filled by a majority of the remaining
directors originally elected by the same series, class or classes of shares who could elect an
individual to fill such vacancy on the Board of Directors, though less than a quorum. except that a
vacancy created by the removal of a director by the vote or written consent of the stockholders
entitled to vote thereon or by court order may be filled by only the vote of a majority of the
outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon represented at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is
present, or by unanimous written consent of all shares entitled to vote thereon. Each director so
elected shall hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders or until a successor has been
elected and qualified.

Acclarent_ Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (JIDC Changes 1}_21_08 ) (PALIB2?_4480371_3) 6
outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon.

(iii) | The election of directors need not be by written ballot unless the Bylaws of the
corporation shall so provide.

4. Conversion. The holders of Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as follows
(the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of
the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share at the office of the corporation
or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock. Each share of each series of Preferred Stock shall be
convertible into the number of fully-paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock which results
from dividing the “Conversion Price” per share in effect for such series of Preferred Stock at the
time of conversion into the “Conversion Value” per share of such series of Preferred Stock. The
number of shares of Common Stock into which each scries of Preferred Stock is convertible is
hereinafter referred to as the “Conversion Rate” for such series of Preferred Stock. As of the date
this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation is filed with the Delaware Secretary of State,
the Conversion Price per share of Series A Preferred shall be $1.04 and the Conversion Value per
share of Series A Preferred shall be $1.04; the Conversion Price per share of Series B Preferred shall
be $2.10 and the Conversion Value per share of Series B Preferred shal] be $2.10; the Conversion
Price per share of Series C Preferred shal] be $3.218 and the Conversion Value per share of Series C
Preferred shall be $3.218; and the Conversion Price per share of the Series D Preferred shall be
$5.72, and the Conversion Value per share of Series D Preferred shall be $5.72. The Conversion
Price of each series of Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment as hereinafter provided.

(b) | Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be
converted into shares of Common Stock at the then applicable Conversion Rate for such series
immediately upon (i) the closing of an underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act’), covering
the corporation’s Common Stock with a per share public offering price (as adjusted for
combinations, stock dividends, subdivisions or split-ups) of at least $7.15 (before deduction of
underwriting commissions, discounts and expenses) and with aggregate gross proceeds to the
corporation, at the public offering price, of at least $50,000,000 or (ii) the date specified by wntten
consent or agreement of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock
(voting together as a class and not as separate series, and on an as-converted basis): provided,
however, that if such automatic conversion is in connection with a Liquidation Event in which the
proceeds to which the holders of Series C Preferred would be entitled to pursuant to Section 2(b) in
respect of their shares of Series C Preferred would be greater than the proceeds such holders would
receive if all such shares of Series C Preferred were converted to Common Stock, the Series C
Preferred Stock shall not be so converted unless the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding
shares of Series C Preferred shall have approved such conversion; and provided further, that if such
automatic conversion is in connection with a Liquidation Event in which the proceeds to which the
holders of Series D Preferred would be entitled to pursuant to Section 2(a) in respect of their shares
of Series D Preferred would be greater than the proceeds such holders would receive if all such
shares of Series D Preferred were converted to Common Stock. the Series D Preferred Stock shall

Acclarent_ Amended and Restated Certificate of Incarporation JDC Changes 1!_21_08)_(PALIB2_4480371_3) 7
not be so converted unless the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding shares of Series D
Preferred Stock shall have approved such conversion.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
convert the same into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the certificate or
certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the corporation or of any transfer agent for such
Preferred Stock and shall vive written notice to the corporation at such office that such holder clects
to convert the same. The corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at
such office to such holder of Preferred Stock or the nominee or nominees of such holder a certificate
or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as
aforesaid. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of
business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the
person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion
shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on
such date. If the conversion is in connection with an underwritten offering of securities registered
pursuant to the Securities Act , the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering Preferred
Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of secuntics
pursuant to such offering, in which event the persons entitled to receive the Common Stock upon
conversion of the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until
immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities. If the conversion is in connection with
Automatic Conversion provisions of subsection 4(b)(ii) above, such conversion shall be deemed to
have been made on the conversion date described in the stockholder consent approving such
conversion, and the persons entitled to receive shares of Common Stock issuable upon such
conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holders of such shares of Common Stock as

of such date.

(d) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon
conversion of the Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would
otherwise be entitled, the corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the
applicable Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock.

(e) Adjustment of Conversion Price.

(i) If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any time after the
date hereof is increased by a stock dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or by a subdivision
or split up of shares of Common Stock, then, on the date such payment is made or such change is
effective, the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock shall be appropriately decreased so
that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of any shares of such series of
Preferred Stock shall be increased in proportion to such increase of outstanding shares.

(ii) If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any time after the
date hereof is decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, then, on the
effective date of such combination, the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock shall be
appropriately increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of
any shares of such series of Preferred Stock shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in

Acclarent_ Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorparatian (JJDC Changes | 121 _08) (PALIB2_4480373_3) 8
outstanding shares.

(iii) In case of any capital reorganization (other than a reorganization covered by
Section 2(e) above), or any reclassification of the stock of the corporation (other than as a result of a
stock dividend or subdivision, split up or combination of shares), the shares of each series of
Preferred Stock shall, after such capital reorganization or reclassification, be convertible into the
kind and number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the corporation or otherwise to
which such holder would have been entitled if immediately prior to such capital reorganization or
reclassification he had converted his shares of such series of Preferred Stock into Common Stock. In
any such case, appropnate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this
Section 4 with respect to the rights of the holders of such series of Preferred Stock after the
recapitalization to the end that the provisions of this Section 4 (including adjustment of the
Conversion Price then in effect and the number of shares purchasable upon conversion of such series
of Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event as nearly equivalently as may be practicable.
The provisions of this clause (iii) shal] similarly apply to successive reorganizations and
reclassifications.

(iv) In the event this corporation shall declare a distribution payable in securities
of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by this corporation or other persons, assets
(excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred to in subsection 4(e), then, in each such
case for the purpose of this subsection 4(e), the holders of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a
proportionate share of any such distribution as though they were the holders of the number of shares
of Common Stock of this corporation into which their shares of Preferred Stock are convertible as of
the record date fixed for the determination of the holders of Common Stock of this corporation
entitled to receive such distribution.

(v) In the event this corporation shall issue Additional Shares of Common (as
detined below) (including Additional Shares of Common deemed to be issued pursuant to subsection
(vi) hereof) without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the applicable
Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such
issue, then, the Conversion Price of the affected series of Preferred Stock shall be reduced.
concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying
such Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of shares which the
aygregate consideration received by the corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of
Common so issued would purchase at such Conversion Price, and the denominator of which shall be
the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number
of such Additional Shares of Common so issued. For the purposes of this Subsection 4(e)(v), all
shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock and
the exercise and/or conversion of any other outstanding evidences of indebtedness, shares or other
securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock (“Convertible Securities”) and all
outstanding rights, options or warrants to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire Common
Stock (“Options’’) or Convertible Securities shall be deemed to be outstanding.
