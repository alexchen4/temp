corporations may be organized under the General Corporation Law of Delaware.

FOUR. The corporation is authorized to issue two classes of stock to be designated Common
Stock and Preferred Stock. The total number of shares of Common Stock which the corporation has
authority to issue is Sixty Million (60,000,000), with par value of $0.001 per share. The total

Hundred Forty Four Thousand Six Hundred Thirty One (13,344,631) of which are designated as
Series B Preferred Stock (“Series B Preferred”) and Eleven Million (11,000,000) of which are
designated as Series C Preferred Stock (“Series C Preferred”).

The relative powers, preferences, special rights, qualifications, limitations and restrictions
granted to or imposed on the Preferred Stock are as follows:

1. Dividends,

(a) The holders of the Series A Preferred, the Series B Preferred and the Series C
Preferred shall be entitled, when and if declared by the Board of Directors of the corporation, to
dividends out of the corporation’s assets legally available therefor at the rate of $0.0832, $0.168 and
$0.257 per annum, respectively (each as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, combinations,
subdivisions, recapitalizations or the like). Dividends on the Series A Preferred, the Series B
Preferred and the Series C Preferred shall be payable on a pari passu basis and in preference and
priority to any payment of any dividend on the Common Stock of the corporation. The right to such
dividends shall not be cumulative, and no right shall accrue by reason of the fact that dividends are’
not declared in any prior period.

(b) After payment of such dividends, any additional dividends or distributions shall be
distributed among all holders of Common Stock and Preferred Stock in proportion to the number of
shares of Common Stock that would be held by each such holder if all shares of Preferred Stock
were converted to Common Stock at the then effective Conversion Rate (as defined in Section 4(a)
below).

(c) | Whenever a dividend or distribution provided for in this Section 1 shall be payable in
property other than cash, the value of such dividend or distribution shall be deemed to be the fair
market value of such property as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the
corporation.

2. Liquidation Preference,

(a) Preference. In the event of a Liquidation Event (as defined below), the holders of
Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred and Series C Preferred shall be entitled to receive, on a pari
passu basis, prior and in preference to any distribution of any of the assets of the corporation to the
holders of Common Stock of the corporation by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount equal
to $1.04 per share for each share of Series A Preferred, $2.10 per share for each share of Series B
Preferred and $3.218 per share for each share of Series C Preferred (each as adjusted for any stock
splits, stock dividends, combinations, subdivisions, recapitalizations or the like) then so held, plus a
further amount equal to any dividends declared but unpaid on such shares.

All of the preferential amount to be paid to the holders of the Preferred Stock under this
Section 2 shall be paid or set apart for payment before the payment or setting apart for payment of
any amount for, or the distribution of any assets of the corporation to, the holders of the Common
Stock in connection with such Liquidation Event.

3712755_6.DOC 2
If, upon such Liquidation Event, the assets of the corporation are insufficient to provide for
the cash payment of the full aforesaid preferential amount to the holders of Preferred Stock, such
assets as are available shall be distributed ratably among the holders of Preferred Stock in proportion
to the full preferential amount each such holder is otherwise entitled to receive.

After the payment or the setting apart of payment to the holders of the Preferred Stock of the
preferential amounts so payable to them, the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive
all remaining assets of the corporation pro rata based on the number of shares of Common Stock
held by each.

(b) Liquidation Event. For purposes of this Section 2, a “Liquidation Event” shall
include: (i) the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, (ii) the sale of all or
substantially all of the assets of the corporation, (iii) a merger, reorganization or consolidation or in _
which the corporation’s stockholders immediately prior to such transaction possess less than fifty
percent (50%) of the voting securities of the surviving, continuing or purchasing entity (or parent, if
any) immediately after the transaction; provided, however, that any payments made may be made in
cash or in securities or other property received from the acquiring entity or in a combination thereof,
on the closing of such transaction, or (iv) the closing of the transfer (whether by merger,
consolidation or otherwise), in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to a person or group
of affiliated persons (other than an underwriter of this corporation’s securities), of this corporation’s
securities if, after such closing, such person or group of affiliated persons would hold fifty percent
(50%) or more of the outstanding voting stock of this corporation (or the surviving or acquiring
entity).

(c) Noncash Distributions, Any securities or other property to be delivered to the holders
of the Preferred Stock and Common Stock upon a Liquidation Event shall be valued as follows:

(i) Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar restrictions on free
marketability:

(A) if traded ona securities exchange, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the
closing prices of the securities on such exchange over the 30-day period ending three (3) business
days prior to the closing;

(B) _ ifactively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the
closing bid prices (or closing sales prices, whichever is applicable) over the 30-day period ending
three (3) business days prior to the closing; and

(C) if there is no active public market, the value shall be the fair market value thereof as
mutually determined by the corporation and the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding shares
of Preferred Stock, provided that if the corporation and the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock are unable to reach agreement, then by independent appraisal
by an investment banker hired and paid by the corporation, but acceptable to the holders of at least
66 2/3% of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock.

3712755_6.DOC 3
(ii) | The method of valuation of securities subject to investment letter or other restrictions
on free marketability shall be to make an appropriate discount from the market value determined as
provided in Sections 2(c)(i)(A), (B) or (C) to reflect the approximate fair market value thereof, as
mutually determined by the corporation and the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding shares
of Preferred Stock.

Giii) All other securities or other property shall be valued at the fair market value thereof,
as mutually determined by the corporation and the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock.

(iv) The foregoing methods for valuing noncash consideration to be distributed in
connection with a Liquidation Event may be superseded by any determination of such value set forth
in the definitive agreements governing such Liquidation Event.

(v) If the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock and
the corporation are unable to reach agreement on any valuation matter, such valuation shall be
submitted to and determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm
selected by the corporation’s Board of Directors and the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the
outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock (or, if such selection cannot be made, by a nationally
recognized independent investment banking firm selected by the American Arbitration Association
in accordance with its rules.)

(d) Inthe event the requirements of Section 2(c) hereof are not complied with, the
corporation shall forthwith either: (i) cause the closing of such Liquidation Event to be postponed
until such time as the requirements of this Section 2 shall be complied with; or (ii) cancel such
transaction, in which event the rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of the Preferred
Stock shall revert to and be the same as such rights, preferences and privileges existing immediately
prior to the date of the first notice referred to in Section 2(e) hereof.

(e) Not later than thirty (30) days before any Liquidation Event, the corporation shall
deliver a notice to each holder of the Preferred Stock announcing such Liquidation Event. Such
notice shall include a description of the amounts that would be paid to the holders of the Preferred
Stock under this Section 2 and of the consideration that such holders would receive if they exercised
their rights to convert their shares of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock. Not later than
ten (10) days after delivery of such notice, each holder of the Preferred Stock may deliver an election
to the corporation notifying the corporation that the holder desires that such holder’s shares of
Preferred Stock be treated as if such shares had been converted into shares of Common Stock. If
such election is delivered, such shares of Preferred Stock subject to such holder’s notice shall be
treated for purposes of the Liquidation Event as if such shares had been converted into Common
Stock in accordance with the provisions of Section 4. If no such election is delivered, such holder
shall receive the amounts as provided for the holders of Preferred Stock under this Section 2.

(f) Consent for Certain Repurchases. So long as Section 2115 of the California General
Corporation Law applies to the corporation, in connection with repurchases by the corporation of its

3712755_6.DOC 4
securities issued to or held by employees or consultants upon termination of their employment or
consulting services pursuant to agreements which provide the corporation with rights to repurchase
such employee’s or consultant’s securities, Sections 502, 503 and 506 of the California General
Corporation Law shall not apply in whole or in part.

3. Voting Rights.

(a) Generally. Except as otherwise provided herein or required by law, the holder of
each share of Preferred Stock shall (i) be entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of
shares of Common Stock into which each share of Preferred Stock could be converted pursuant to
Section 3 hereof at the record date for the determination of the stockholders entitled to vote on such
matters or, if no such record date is established, at the date such vote is taken and (ii) have voting
rights and powers equal to the voting rights and powers of the Common Stock and shall be entitled,
notwithstanding any provision hereof, to notice of any stockholders’ meeting in accordance with the
Bylaws of this corporation. Each holder of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote for
each share thereof held. Fractional votes shall not, however, be permitted and any fractional voting
rights resulting from the above formula shall be rounded to the nearest whole number (with one-half
rounded upward to one).

(b) —_ Election of Directors.

(i) As long as 5,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock are outstanding, the holders of at least
66 2/3% of the outstanding Preferred Stock shall be entitled to elect two (2) directors of this
corporation at any election of directors (each, a “Preferred Director”). A majority of the holders of
Common Stock, voting as a separate class, shall be entitled to elect two (2) directors of this
corporation at any election of directors. The holders of Preferred Stock and Common Stock (voting
together as a single class and not as separate series, and on an as-converted basis) shall be entitled to
elect any remaining directors of this corporation.

(ii} | Vacancies in the Board of Directors may be filled by a majority of the remaining
directors originally elected by the same series, class or classes of shares who could elect an
individual to fill such vacancy on the Board of Directors, though less than a quorum, except that a
vacancy created by the removal of a director by the vote or written consent of the stockholders
entitled to vote thereon or by court order may be filled by only the vote of a majority of the
outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon represented at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is
present, or by unanimous written consent of all shares entitled to vote thereon. Each director so
elected shall hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders or until a successor has been
elected and qualified.

The stockholders entitled to vote thereon may elect a director or directors at any time to fill
any vacancy or vacancies not filled by the directors, but any such election other than to fill a vacancy
created by removal, if by written consent, shall require the consent of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon.

(iii) | The election of directors need not be by written ballot unless the Bylaws of the

3712755_6.DOC 5
corporation shall so provide.

4. Conversion. The holders of Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as follows
(the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of
the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share at the office of the corporation
or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock. Each share of each series of Preferred Stock shall be
convertible into the number of fully-paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock which results
from dividing the “Conversion Price” per share in effect for such series of Preferred Stock at the
time of conversion into the “Conversion Value” per share of such series of Preferred Stock. The
number of shares of Common Stock into which each series of Preferred Stock is convertible is
hereinafter referred to as the “Conversion Rate” for such series of Preferred Stock. As of the date
this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation is filed with the Delaware Secretary of State,
the Conversion Price per share of Series A Preferred shall be $1.04 and the Conversion Value per
share of Series A Preferred shall be $1.04; the Conversion Price per share of Series B Preferred shall
be $2.10 and the Conversion Value per share of Series B Preferred shall be $2.10; and the
Conversion Price per share of Series C Preferred shall be $3,218 and the Conversion Value per share
of Series C Preferred shall be $3.218. The Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock shall
be subject to adjustment as hereinafter provided.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be
converted into shares of Common Stock at the then applicable Conversion Rate for such series
immediately upon (i) the closing of an underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, covering the corporation’s
Common Stock with a per share public offering price (as adjusted for combinations, stock dividends,
subdivisions or split-ups) of at least $6.436 (before deduction of underwriting commissions,
discounts and expenses) and with aggregate gross proceeds to the corporation, at the public offering
price, of at least $30,000,000 or (ii) the date specified by written consent or agreement of the holders
of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (voting together as a class and not as
separate series, and on an as-converted basis); provided, however, that if such automatic conversion
is in connection with a Liquidation Event in which the proceeds to which the holders of Series C
Preferred Stock would be entitled to pursuant to Section 2(a) in respect of their shares of Series C
Preferred Stock would be greater than the proceeds such holders would receive if all such shares of
Series C Preferred Stock were converted to Common Stock, the Series C Preferred Stock shall not be
so converted unless the holders of at least 66 2/3 % of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred
Stock shall have approved such conversion.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shal! be entitled to
convert the same into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the certificate or
certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the corporation or of any transfer agent for such
Preferred Stock and shall give written notice to the corporation at such office that such holder elects
to convert the same. The corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at
such office to such holder of Preferred Stock or the nominee or nominees of such holder a certificate
or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as

3712755_6.DOC 6
aforesaid. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of
business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the
person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion
shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on
such date. If the conversion is in connection with an underwritten offering of securities registered
pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the conversion may, at the option of any holder
tendering Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of
the sale of securities pursuant to such offering, in which event the persons entitled to receive the
Common Stock upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such
Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities. If the conversion is
in connection with Automatic Conversion provisions of subsection 4(b)(ii) above, such conversion
shall be deemed to have been made on the conversion date described in the stockholder consent
approving such conversion, and the persons entitled to receive shares of Common Stock issuable
upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holders of such shares of
Common Stock as of such date.

(d) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon
conversion of the Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would
otherwise be entitled, the corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the
applicable Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock.

(e) Adjustment of Conversion Price.

(i) If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any time after the
date hereof is increased by a stock dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or by a subdivision
or split up of shares of Common Stock, then, on the date such payment is made or such change is
effective, the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock shall be appropriately decreased so
that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of any shares of such series of
Preferred Stock shall be increased in proportion to such increase of outstanding shares.

(ii) ‘If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any time after the
date hereof is decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, then, on the
effective date of such combination, the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock shall be
appropriately increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of
any shares of such series of Preferred Stock shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in
outstanding shares.

(iii) In case of any capital reorganization (other than a reorganization covered by
Section 2(b) above), or any reclassification of the stock of the Corporation (other than as a result of a
stock dividend or subdivision, split up or combination of shares), the shares of each series of
Preferred Stock shall, after such capital reorganization or reclassification, be convertible into the
kind and number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the Corporation or otherwise to
which such holder would have been entitled if immediately prior to such capital reorganization or
reclassification he had converted his shares of such series of Preferred Stock into Common Stock. In
any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this

3712755. 6.DOC 7
Section 4 with respect to the rights of the holders of such series of Preferred Stock after the
recapitalization to the end that the provisions of this Section 4 (including adjustment of the
Conversion Price then in effect and the number of shares purchasable upon conversion of such series
of Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event as nearly equivalently as may be practicable.
The provisions of this clause (iii) shall similarly apply to successive reorganizations and
reclassifications.

(iv) Inthe event this corporation shall declare a distribution payable in securities
of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by this corporation or other persons, assets
(excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred to in subsection 4(e), then, in each such
case for the purpose of this subsection 4(e), the holders of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a
proportionate share of any such distribution as though they were the holders of the number of shares
of Common Stock of this corporation into which their shares of Preferred Stock are convertible as of
the record date fixed for the determination of the holders of Common Stock of this corporation
entitled to receive such distribution.

(v) In the event this corporation shall issue Additional Shares of Common (as
defined below) (including Additional Shares of Common deemed to be issued pursuant to subsection
(vi) hereof) without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the applicable
Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such
issue, then, the Conversion Price of the affected series of Preferred Stock shall be reduced,
concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying
such Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of shares which the
aggregate consideration received by the corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of
Common so issued would purchase at such Conversion Price, and the denominator of which shall be
the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number
of such Additional Shares of Common so issued. For the purposes of this Subsection 4(e){v), all
shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock and
the exercise and/or conversion of any other outstanding evidences of indebtedness, shares or other
securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock (“Convertible Securities”) and all
outstanding rights, options or warrants to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire Common
Stock (“Options”) or Convertible Securities shall be deemed to be outstanding.

“Additional Shares of Common” shall mean all shares of Common Stock issued (or,
pursuant to subsection (vi) hereof, deemed to be issued) by the corporation after the filing of this
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, other than issuances or deemed issuances of:

(1) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable to officers, directors and
employees of, or consultants to, the corporation pursuant to stock grants, option plans, purchase
plans or other employee stock incentive programs or arrangements approved by the Board of
Directors (provided that such stock grants, option plans, purchase plans, other employee stock
incentive programs or arrangements have been approved by at least one Preferred Director), or upon
exercise of options or warrants granted to such parties pursuant to any such plan or arrangement;

3712755_6.DOC 8
(2) shares of Common Stock issued upon the exercise or conversion of
Options or Convertible Securities outstanding as of the date of the filing of this Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation or shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of
Preferred Stock;

(3) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable as dividend or distribution
on Preferred Stock or pursuant to any event for which adjustment is made pursuant to paragraph
4(e)(i), 4(e)(ii), 4(e) (iii), or 4(e)(iv) hereof;

(4) shares of Common Stock issued in a registered public offering under
the Securities Act pursuant to which all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock are automatically
converted into Common Stock pursuant to an Automatic Conversion Event;

(5) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable pursuant to the acquisition
of another corporation by the corporation by merger, purchase of substantially all of the assets or
other reorganization or to a joint venture agreement, provided, that such issuances are approved by
the Board of Directors: "

(6) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable to banks, equipment
lessors or other financial institutions pursuant to a debt financing or commercial leasing transaction
approved by the Board of Directors;

(7) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable in connection with any

one Preferred Director);

(8) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable in connection with
sponsored research, collaboration, technology license, development, marketing or other similar
agreements or strategic partnerships approved by the Board of Directors, provided however that if
more than 10% of the corporation’s Common Stock is to be issued, such issuance shall be approved
by the Board of Directors (including both Preferred Directors); and

(9) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable to suppliers or third party
service providers in connection with the provision of goods or services pursuant to transactions
approved by the Board of Directors (including one Preferred Director);

(vi) “Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common.” In the event the
corporation at any time or from time to time after the date of the filing of this Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation shall issue any Options or Convertible Securities or shall fix a record
date for the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive any such Options or
Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of shares (as set forth in the instrument relating
thereto without regard to any provisions contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such
number) of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case of Convertible
Securities, the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities or, in the case of Options for
Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options and the conversion or exchange of the

3712755_6.DOC 9
underlying securities, shall be deemed to have been issued as of the time of such issue or, in case
such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, provided
that in any such case in which shares are deemed to be issued:

(1) no further adjustment in the Conversion Price of any series of
Preferred Stock shall be made upon the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities or shares of
Common Stock in connection with the exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities;

(2) if such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms provide, with
the passage of time or otherwise, for any change in the consideration payable to the corporation or in
the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange thereof
(other than a change pursuant to the anti-dilution provisions of such Options or Convertible
Securities such as this Section 4(e)(vi) or pursuant to recapitalization provisions of such Options or
Convertible Securities such as Sections 4(e)(i), 4(e)(ii) or 4(e)(iii) hereof), the Conversion Price of
each series of Preferred Stock and any subsequent adjustments based thereon shall be recomputed to
reflect such change as if such change had been in effect as of the original issue thereof (or upon the
occurrence of the record date with respect thereto);

(3) no readjustment pursuant to clause (2) above shall have the effect of
increasing the Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock to an amount above the Conversion
Price that would have resulted from any other issuances of Additional Shares of Common and any
other adjustments provided for herein between the original adjustment date and such readjustment
date;

(4) upon the expiration of any such Options or any rights of conversion or
exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have been exercised, the Conversion
Price of each Series of Preferred Stock computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon the
occurrence of a record date with respect thereto) and any subsequent adjustments based thereon
shall, upon such expiration, be recomputed as if:

(a) . inthe case of Convertible Securities or Options for Common
Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common issued were the shares of Common Stock, if any,
actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities and the consideration received therefor was the consideration actually received by the
corporation for the issue of such exercised Options plus the consideration actually received by the
corporation upon such exercise or for the issue of all such Convertible Securities which were
actually converted or exchanged, plus the additional consideration, if any, actually received by the
corporation upon such conversion or exchange, and

(b) inthe case of Options for Convertible Securities, only the
Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were issued at the time of
issue of such Options, and the consideration received by the corporation for the Additional Shares of
Common deemed to have been then issued was the consideration actually received by the
corporation for the issue of such exercised Options, plus the consideration deemed to have been

3712755_6.D0C 10
received by the corporation (determined pursuant to Section 4(e)(vii)) upon the issue of the
Convertible Securities with respect to which such Options were actually exercised; and

(5) ifsuch record date shall have been fixed and such Options or
Convertible Securities are not issued on the date fixed therefor, the adjustment previously made in
the Conversion Price which became effective on such record date shall be canceled as of the close of
business on such record date, and thereafter the Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this
paragraph as of the actual date of their issuance.

(vii) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this subsection 4(e), the
consideration received by the corporation for the issue (or deemed issue) of any Additional Shares of
Common shall be computed as follows:

(1) Cash and Property. Such consideration shall:

(a) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the aggregate
amount of cash received by the corporation before deducting any reasonable discounts, commissions
or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in
connection with such issuance;

(b) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be computed
at the fair market value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors; and

(c) in the event Additional Shares of Common are issued together
with other shares or securities or other assets of the corporation for consideration which covers both,
be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in clauses (a) and (b)
above, as reasonably determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(2) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per share
received by the corporation for Additional Shares of Common deemed to have been issued pursuant
to paragraph 4(e)(vi) shall be determined by dividing:

(x) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the
corporation as consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the
minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating
thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such
consideration) payable to the corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the
exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities by;

(y) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set forth
in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a

3712755_6.D0C di
subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion
or exchange of such Convertible Securities.

(f) Minimal Adjustments. No adjustment in the Conversion Price of any series of
Preferred Stock need be made if such adjustment would result in a change in such Conversion Price
of less than $0.01. Any adjustment of less than $0.01 which is not made shall be carried forward and
shall be made at the time of and together with any subsequent adjustment which, on a cumulative
basis, amounts to an adjustment of $0.01 or more in the Conversion Price.

(zg) No Impairment. The corporation will not, through any reorganization, transfer of
assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action,
avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or
performed hereunder by the corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out
of all the provisions of this Section 4 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or
appropriate in order to protect the Conversion Rights of the holders of Preferred Stock against
impairment. This provision shall not restrict the corporation from amending its Certificate of
