with respect to the applicable series of Preferred Stock so converted shall terminate, except any
of the rights of the holder thereof, upon surrender of the holder’s certificate or certificates
therefor, to receive certificates for the number of sharcs of Common Stock into which such series

holder’s nominees in which the holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common
