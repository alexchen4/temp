(c) Mechanics of Conversion,

(1) In order for a holder of Preferred Stock to convert shares of
Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stuck, such holder shall surrender the certificate or
certificates for such shares of Preferred Stock, at the office of the transfer agent for such series of
Preferred Stock (or at the principal office of the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own
transfer agent), together with written notice that such holder elects to convert all or any number
of the shares of Preferred Stock represented by such certificate or certificates. Such notice shall
state such holder’s name or the names of the nominees in which such holder wishes the
certificate or cerlificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued. If required by the
Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by a
written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly
executed by the registered holder or his or its attorney duly authorized in writing. The date of
receipt of such certificates and notice by the transfer agent (or by the Corporation if the
Corporation serves as ils own transfer agent) shall be the conversion date (“Conversion Date”),
and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the shares represented by such
certificate shall be deemed to be outstanding of record as of such date. The Corporation shall, as
soon as practicable after the Conversion Date, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of
Preferred Stock, or to his or its nominees, a certificate ur certificates for the number of shares of
Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled, together with cash in lieu of any fraction
ofa share,

(ii) | The Corporation shall at all times when any Preferred Stock shall
be outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued stock, for the
purpose of effecting the conversion of the Preferred Stock, such number of its duly authorized
shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all
outstanding Preferred Stock. Before taking any action that would cause an adjustment reducing
the Senes A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price or Series D
Conversion Price below the then par value of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of the applicable series of Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take any corporate
action that may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Corporation may
validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock at such adjusted
Scrics A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price or Series D
Conversion Price, as the case may be.

(iii) ‘If, at the time of any conversion pursuant to the terms of this
Subsection B.4, declared and unpaid dividends exist with respect to any such shares of Series A
Preferred Stock, Series B Preterred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock or Series D Preferred Stock,
then upon any such conversion, no adjustment ta thc Series A Conversion Price, Series B
Conversion Price, Series C Preferred Stock or Series D Conversion Price shall be made for any
declared but unpaid dividends and all such declared and unpaid dividends on such converted
shares shal] be cancelled.

(iv) All shares of Preferred Stock that shall have been surrendered for
conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights with
respect to such sharcs of Preferred Stock, including the rights, if any. to receive notices and to
vote, shall immediately cease and terminate on the Conversion Date. excent only the right of the
holders thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor. Any shares of
Preferred Stock so converted shall be retired and cancelled and shall not be reissued, and the
Corporation (without the need for stockholder action) may from time to time take such
appropriate action as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of such series
of Preferred Stock accordingly.

(v) | The Corporation shall pay any and all taxes that may be payable in
respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of shares of
Preferred Stock pursuant to this Subsection B.4. The Corporation shall not, however, be required
to pay any tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and
delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in which the shares of Preferred
Stock so converted were registered. and no such issuance or delivery shall be made unless and
until the person or entity requesting such issuance has paid to the Corporation the amount of any
