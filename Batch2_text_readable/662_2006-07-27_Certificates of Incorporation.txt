(B) Rights, Preferences and Restrictions of Series A and B Stock. The rights,
preferences, privileges, and restrictions granted to and imposed on the Series A and B Stock are as set forth
below in this Article Four (B).

1. Dividend Provisions.

(a) The holders of shares of Series A and B Stock shall be entitled to receive
dividends, out of any assets legally available therefor, prior and in preference to any declaration
or payment of any dividend (payable other than in Common Stock) on the Common Stock of
the Company, at the rate of 10% of the (i) Original Series A Issue Price (as defined below in
subsection 2(a)), in the case of the Series A Preferred Stock, and (ii) Onginal s Series B Issue
Price (as defined below in subsection 2(a)), in the case of the Series B Preferred Stock, per
share per annum (the “Series A and B Dividend Rate”), payable When, as and if declared by the
Board of Directors. Such dividends shall accrue on a daily basis, whether.or not eamed or

: the date of issuance of such shares of Series A and B Stock. Such
dividends Shall be cumul so that if at any time the entire amount of such dividends shall not
have been pai deficiency shall first be fully paid before any dividend or other distribution
shall be paid on or dec and set apart for the Common Stock. Accrued but unpaid dividends
shall be paid with respect to a share of Series A and B Stock upon conversion of such share to
Common Stock, upon redemption of such share, upon the exchange or reclassification of such
share or upon a liquidation as set forth in Section 2.

(b) No cash dividend or other distribution shall be paid, or declared and set apart
for payment, on any share of Common Stock unless, subject to Section 1(d) below, a pro rata
cash dividend or other distribution (separate from and in addition to the dividend set forth in
Section] (a)) is paid with respect to all outstanding shares of Series A and B Stock based on the
number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series A and B Stock are
convertible pursuant to Section 4 hereof as of the record date for determination of the holders of
capital stock of the Company entitled to such dividend or distribution.

(c) If at any time the Company pays a dividend or distribution on the Series A and
B Stock in an amount less than the total amount of dividends then accrued and payable with
respect to all shares of Series A and B Stock, such payment will be distributed ratably among
the holders of such shares of Series A and B Stock pro rata in proportion to the aggregate
accrued but unpaid dividends on the shares of Series A and B Stock held by each such holder.

(d) All accrued and unpaid dividends payable on the Series A and B Stock pursuant
to Section 1(a) or 1(b) shall be paid, at the option of each holder of shares of Series A and B
Stock, either (A) in cash (to the extent assets are legally available therefor and any amounts for
which assets are not legally available shall be paid promptly as assets become legally available
therefor; any partial payment will be made pro rata among the holders of such shares), or (B) by
issuance of additional shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, in the case of dividends payable on
the Series A-1 Preferred Stock and Series A-2 Preferred Stock, Series A-3 Preferred Stock, in
the case of dividends payable on the Series A-3 Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, in
the case of dividends payable on the Series B Preferred Stock (a “PIK Dividend”). The number
of shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series A-3 Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock,
as the case may be, to be issued in connection with a PIK Dividend shall equal the aggregate
dollar amount of the applicable accrued and unpaid dividends then owed to such holder of
Series A and B Stock, divided by (i) the Original Series A Issue Price (as defined below), in the
case of Series A Preferred Stock, and (ii) the Original Series B Issue Price (as defined below),
in the case of Series B Preferred Stock. All shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series A-3
Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, as the case may be, issued pursuant to a PIK
Dividend will thereupon be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. Each
such PIK Dividend shall be made pro rata with respect to the outstanding shares of Series A and
B Stock with respect to which PIK Dividends are being paid in accordance with the respective
dividends then due and payable thereon. Dividends with respect to such additional shares of
Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series A-3 Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, as the case
may be, issued as a PIK Dividend shall accrue at the rates and be due and payable on the terms
set forth in this Section 1. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subsection (d), in
the event of an automatic conversion of shares of Series A and B Stock pursuant to Section 4(b)
hereof, all accrued and unpaid dividends on such shares of Series A and B Stock shall be paid
by the issuance of PIK Dividends, in which case the amount of such PIK Dividends shall be
taken into account in determining the number of shares of Common Stock into which such
shares of Series A and B Stock are convertible pursuant to Section 4 hereof.

2. Liquidation Preference.

ownership thereof, an amount per share (or with respect to a transaction described in Section
2(c)(i) or (ii), receive in such transaction securities or other property having a value per share)
equal to the sum of (1) (A) $1.00 per share (adjusted to reflect subsequent stock dividends,
stock splits or recapitalizations) of Series A Preferred Stock (the “Original Series A Issue
Price”), in the case of Series A Preferred Stock, and (B) the price paid per share (adjusted to
reflect subsequen f Ok dividends, stock splits or recapitalizations) of Series B Preferred Stock

B Issue Price’), in the case of Series B Preferred Stock and (2) an amount equal to the accrued
but unpaid dividends on such share, less the aggregate amount of distributions paid to the
holders of the Series A and B Stock pursuant to Section 4(e) (such amount payable with respect
to one share of Series A and B Stock being sometimes referred to as the “Preferred Liquidation
Payment” and with respect to all shares of Series A and B Stock being sometimes referred to as
the ‘Preferred Liquidation Payments”).

(ii) If upon the occurrence of such event, the assets and funds thus
distributed among the holders of the Series A and B Stock pursuant to Section 2(a)(i) above
shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full Preferred Liquidation
Payments, then the entire assets and funds of the Company legally available for distribution
shall be distributed ratably among the holders of the Series A and B Stock in proportion to the
respective amounts which would otherwise be payable to them upon such distribution if all
amounts payable on or with respect to such shares were paid in full.

(b) e completion of the distribution required by subsection (a) of this
Section 2, thecemaining assets of the Company available for distribution to stockholders shall
be distributed among the holders of Series A and B Stock and Common Stock pro rata based on
the number of shares of Common Stock held by each (assuming conversion of all such Series A
and B Stock).

of the Company shall be deemed to be occasioned by, or to include, (A) the acquisition of the

excluding any merger effected exclusively for the purpose of changing the domicile of the
Company); or (B) a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company. For purposes of
Section 2(a)(ii), if more than one such event shal] occur in succession, the date of such event
shall be the date of the first event to occur.

(ii) In any of such events, if the consideration received by the Company or
to be received by its stockholders is other than cash or securities (which shall be valued as set
forth below), the Company shall promptly engage independent competent appraisers to
determine the value of the assets to be distributed to the holders of shares of Series A and B
Stock. The Company shall, upon receipt of such appraiser’s valuation, give prompt written
notice of the appraiser’s valuation to each holder of shares of Series A and B Stock.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any securities shall be valued as follows:

(A) Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar
restrictions on free marketability covered by (B) below:

(1) _ Iftraded on a securities exchange or through
NASDAQ Stock Market, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the
securities on such exchange over the fifteen (15) trading day period ending three (3) trading days
prior to the closing;

(2) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the
fifteen (15) trading day period ending three (3) trading days prior to the closing; and

(3) If there is no active public market, the value shall be
the fair market value thereof, as determined by an independent competent appraiser engaged by
the Company.

() The method of valuation of securities subject to investment
letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of
a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount
from the market value determined as above in (A) (1), (2) or (3) to reflect the approximate fair
market value thereof, as determined by an independent competent appraiser engaged by the
Company.
(iii) In the event the requirements of this subsection 2(c) are not complied
with, the Company shall forthwith either:

(A) cause such closing to be postponed until such time as the
requirements of this Section 2 have been complied with; or

(B) cancel such transaction, in which event the rights, preferences
and privileges of the holders of the Series A and B Stock shall revert to and be the same as such
rights, preferences and privileges existing immediately prior to the date of the first notice
referred to in subsection 2(c)(iv) hereof.

(iv) | The Company shall give each holder of record of Series A and B Stock
written notice of such impending transaction not later than twenty (20) days prior to the
stockholders’ meeting called to approve such transaction, or thirty (30) days prior to the closing
of such transaction, whichever is earlier, and shall also notify such holders in writing of the final
approval of such transaction. The first of such notices shall describe the material terms and
conditions of the impending transaction and the provisions of this Section 2, and the Company
shall thereafter give such holders prompt notice of any material changes. The transaction shall
in no event take place sooner than twenty (20) days after the Company has given the first notice
provided for herein or sooner than fifteen (15) days after the Company has given notice of any
material changes provided for herein; provided, however, that such periods may be shortened
upon the written consent of the holders of at least a majority of all then outstanding shares of
Series A and B Stock voting together as a single class (the “Requisite Majority”).

3. Redemption.
(a) Series A and B Stock.

(i) The Series A and B Stock may be required to be redeemed by the
Company at the option of the holders of at least a majority of all then outstanding shares of
Series A and B Stock, voting together as a single class, on or after the earlier to occur of (i) the
fifth anniversary of the first date upon which any shares of Series B Preferred Stock are first
issued (the “Series B Purchase Date”), or (ii) an Event of Default (as defined below) (an
“Optional Redemption”). For purposes herein, an “Event of Default” shall mean (i) the filing of
any petition, whether voluntary or involuntary, seeking the reorganization or liquidation of the
Company under any provision of the federal bankruptcy code or any other federal or state

or trustee for the Company or any of its properties by a court order and which appointment is

property of the Company, (iv) the Company or any executive officer of the Company shall be
convicted of, or enter a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, any felony involving moral
turpitude or relating to the business of the Company, (v) the Company breaches a material
provision of the (A) Series A-1 Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of October 21,
2003 (the “Series A-1 and 2 Purchase Date’’) by and between the Company and certain
investors listed in Schedule I thereto (the “Series A-1 Purchase Agreement”), (B) the
Contribution Agreement dated as of the Series A-1 and 2 Purchase Date by and between the
Company and AP Investors, LLC (the “Contribution Agreement”), (C) Series A-3 Preferred
Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of July 29, 2005 (the “Series A-3 Purchase Date”) by and
between the Company and certain investors listed in Schedule I thereto (the “Series A-3
Purchase Agreement”), or (D) Series B Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of the
Series B Purchase Date by and between the Company and certain investors listed in Schedule I
thereto (the “Series B Purchase Agreement”), or any of the agreements attached as exhibits
thereto and executed in connection therewith, and such breach is not cured within thirty (30)
days of notice thereof.

(ii) Upon each receipt of a written notice of an Optional Redemption (the
“Redemption Notice”) specifying a date not less than one hundred and twenty (120) days from
the date of such notice on which the outstanding Series A and/or B Stock requested to be
redeemed shall be redeemed (the “Optional Redemption Date”), the Company shall promptly
notify the remaining holders of the Series A and B Stock of such Optional Redemption. The
remaining holders of Series A and B Stock will have the right to participate in such redemption
if they so elect by giving the Company written notice to such effect within fifteen (15) days of
having received such notice. The Company shal! redeem on the Optional Redemption Date
each share of Series A and B Stock being redeemed by paying in cash therefor, an amount equal
to the greater of (i) (A) the Original Series A Issue Price, in the case of the Series A Preferred
Stock, and (B) the Original Series B Issue Price, in the case of the Series B Preferred Stock,
plus all accrued but unpaid dividends on such share and (ii) the Fair Value (as determined
below) of each such share of Series A Preferred Stock and/or Series B Preferred Stock, as the
case may be, plus all accrued but unpaid dividends on such share (the “Redemption Price”);
provided, however, that the Company may elect to redeem one-third (1/3) of the shares
requested to be redeemed by such holder(s) under this Section 3(a) on the Optional Redemption
Date, one-third (1/3) of such shares on the anniversary of the Optional Redemption Date and the
final one-third (1/3) of such shares on the second anniversary of the Optional Redemption Date.

(b) The Fair Value shall be determined by an independent competent appraiser
mutually agreed to by the Company and the holders of at least a majority of the shares of Series
A and/or B Stock requesting redemption. In the event the Company and the holders of at least a
majority of the shares of Series A and/or B Stock requesting redemption cannot mutually agree
upon an independent appraiser within fifteen (15) days of receipt by the Company of a
Redemption Notice, the Company and the holders of at least a majority of the shares of Series A
and/or B Stock requesting redemption will each select an independent competent appraiser of
national reputation to determine the Fair Value of the Series A and/or B Stock. The respective
appraisals will be provided to the Company and the holders of the Series A and/or B Stock
requesting redemption promptly upon completion. Ifthe Fair Value of the greater appraisal
does not exceed 1.1 times the Fair Value of the lesser appraisal of the Series A Preferred Stock,
the Fair Value shall be the average of the two appraisals. In the event the Fair Value of the
greater appraisal exceeds 1.1 times the Fair Value of the lesser appraisal, the two appraisers
chosen by the Company and holders of Series A and/or B Stock requesting redemption,
respectively, shall choose a third independent competent appraiser of national reputation and the
third appraiser shall conduct an appraisal to determine the Fair Value of the Series A and/or B
Stock (the "Third Appraisal"). Upon completion, the Third Appraisal shall be promptly
delivered to the Company and the holders of Series A and/or B Stock requesting redemption.
The Third Appraisal valuation shall be averaged with the prior appraisal that is closer in value
to the Third Appraisal. The average of these two appraisals shall be the Fair Value of the Series
A and/or B Stock and binding on the Company and the holders of the Series A and/or B Stock.
All appraisals required herein shall be paid for by the Company. In determining the Fair Value,
each of the appraisers shall evaluate the Company as a whole, on a going concem and
controlling interest basis, without application of any discount whatsoever, including any
discount for a minority ownership interest and/or lack of marketability of such interest.

(c) If the funds of the Company legally available for redemption of shares of Series
A and/or B Stock on any Optional Redemption Date are insufficient to redeem the total number
of shares of Series A and/or B Stock to be redeemed on such date, those funds which are legally
available will be used to redeem the maximum possible number of such shares ratably among
the holders of such shares to be redeemed based upon the respective amounts which would
otherwise be payable in respect of the shares to be redeemed if legally available funds were
sufficient to redeem all such shares. The shares of Series A and B Stock not redeemed shall
remain outstanding and entitled to all the rights and preferences provided herein. At any time
thereafter when additional funds of the Company are legally available for the redemption of
shares of Series A and B Stock, such funds will immediately be used to redeem the balance of
the shares which the Company has become obliged to redeem on such Optional Redemption
Date but which it has not redeemed.

(d) In the event the Company fails to timely pay the full amounts owed pursuant to
this Section 3 on the applicable Optional Redemption Date, as of the date immediately
following the due date of the outstanding balance under the applicable Redemption Price, (i) the
holders of Series A and B Stock shall have the rights set forth in Section 5(d) below and (ii) the
Series A and B Dividend Rate shall be increased to twenty percent (20%) of (i) the Original
Series A Issuance Price, in the case of Series A Preferred Stock, and (ii) the Original Series B
Issuance Price, in the case of Series B Preferred Stock (the “Default Rate”). Should the amount
then due and outstanding pursuant to this Section 3 be considered a debt obligation of the
Company under applicable law and the Series A and B Dividend Rate shall cease to be
applicable, the outstanding redemption amount owed to the holders of the Series A and B Stock
shall accrue interest at the lesser of (a) the Default Rate and (b) the then applicable maximum
rate allowed by law.

4, Conversion. The holders of the Series A and B Stock shall have conversion rights as
follows:

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Series A and B Stock (including those shares
of Series A and B Stock issued or issuable pursuant to the PIK Dividend, whether or not
declared) shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of
issuance of such share into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common
Stock as is determined by dividing (i)(A) $1.00 per share, in the case of the Series A Preferred
Stock, and (B) $1.50 per share, in the case of the Series B Preferred Stock, by (i) the Conversion
Price applicable to such share, determined as hereafter provided, in effect on the date the
certificate is surrendered for conversion. The initial Conversion Price per share for shares of
Series A Preferred Stock shall be $1.00, and the initial Conversion Price per share for shares of
Series B Preferred Stock shall be $1.50; provided, however, that the Conversion Price for the
Series A and B Stock shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in subsection 4(d).

(b) Automatic Conversion. Subject to the conditions set forth below, each share
of Series A and B Stock (including those shares of Series A and B Stock issued or issuable
pursuant to the PIK Dividend, whether or not declared) shal! automatically be converted into
shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Price at the time in effect for such Series A and B
Stock immediately upon the Company’s sale of its Common Stock in a firm commitment
underwritten public offering pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), covering the offer and sale of Common Stock for the
account of the Company in which the gross proceeds to the Company are equal to or greater
than twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000), and in which the price to the public per share of
Common Stock equals or exceeds five (5) times the Original Series A Issue Price (a "Qualified
Public Offering").

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Series A and B Stock shall
be entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the
certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by proper instruments
of transfer (or, in the event a certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, an affidavit as to that
fact), at the principal corporate office of the Company or of any transfer agent for the Series A
and B Stock, and shall give written notice to the Company at such office, of the election to
convert the same and shall state therein the name or names in which the certificate or
certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued. The Company shall, as soon as
practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Series A and B Stock, or
to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares
of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid, Such conversion shall be
deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such
surrender of the shares of Series A and B Stock to be converted, and the person or persons
entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated
for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock as of such date.
If the conversion is in connection with an underwritten offering of securities registered pursuant
to the Securities Act, the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering Series A and B
Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of
securities pursuant to such offering, in which event the person(s) entitled to receive the
Common Stock upon conversion of the Series A and B Stock shall not be deemed to have
converted such Series A and B Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of
securities.

(d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock for Certain Dilutive
Issuances, Splits and Combinations. The Conversion Price of the Series A and B Stock shall
be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

(i)

(A) If the Company shall issue, after the Series B Purchase Date,
any Additional Stock (as defined below) for a consideration per share less than the Series A
Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock, the
Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall forthwith
(except as otherwise provided in this clause (i)) be adjusted to a price equal to the price paid per
share for such Additional Stock. If the Cofmpany shall issue, after sis Z Purchase Date,
any Additional Stock (as defined below) fe seston per share less thay the Series B
Conversion Price in effect immediately p o the issuance of such Additiorfal Stock, the
Series B Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to each si issyance shall forthwith
(except as otherwise provided in this clause (i)) be adjusted to‘ price equal tothe price paid per
share for such Additional Stock. Rererenl 9

(B) No adjustment of the Conversion Price for the Series A and B

Stock shall be made in an amount less than one cent per share, provided that any adjustments
which are not required to be made by reason of this sentence shall be carried forward and shall
be either taken into account in any subsequent adjustment made prior to 3 years from the date of
the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward, or shall be made at the end of 3
years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward. Except to
the limited extent provided for in subsections (E)(3) and (E)(4), no adjustment of such
Conversion Price pursuant to this subsection 4(d)(i) shall have the effect of increasing the
Conversion Price above the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment.

(C) In the case of the issuance of Common Stock for cash, the
consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting any
reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the Company
for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

(D) In the case of the issuance of the Common Stock for a
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be
deemed to be the fair value thereof as determined by the Board of Directors, subject to the
reasonable approval by the Requisite Majority, irrespective of any accounting treatment.

(E) In the case of the issuance of options to purchase or rights to
subscribe for Common Stock, securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for
Common Stock or options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or
exchangeable securities, the following provisions shall apply for all purposes of this subsection

4(d)(i):

(1) The aggregate maximum number of shares of Common
Stock deliverable upon exercise (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to exerciseability,
including without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account potential
antidilution adjustments) of such options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common Stock
shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such options or rights were issued and fora
consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in subsections
4(d)(i)(C) and 4(dXi)(D)), if any, received by the Company upon the issuance of such options or
rights plus the minimum exercise price provided in such options or rights (without taking into
account potential antidilution adjustments) for the Common Stock covered thereby.

(2) The aggregate maximum number of shares of Common
Stock deliverable upon conversion of or in exchange (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions
to convertibility or exchangeability, including, without limitation, the passage of time, but
without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) for any such convertible or
exchangeable securities or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for
such convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof shall
be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or such options or rights
were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration, if any, reccived by the Company
for any such securities and related options or rights (excluding any cash received on account of
accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the minimum additional consideration, if any, to be
received by the Company (without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) upon
the conversion or exchange of such securities or the exercise of any related options or rights (the
consideration in each case to be determined in the manner provided in subsections 4(d)(i)(C) and

4(d)(i)(D)).
(3) In the event of any change in the number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to the Company upon exercise of

to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock or

indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock (hereinafter referred to as “Common Stock
Equivalents”) without payment of any consideration by such holder for the additional shares of
Common Stock or the Common Stock Equivalents (including the additional shares of Common

made so that the holders of the Series A and B Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon
conversion of the Series A and B Stock the number of shares of stock or other securities or
property of the Company or otherwise, to which a holder of Common Stock deliverable upon
conversion would have been entitled on such recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate
adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 4 with respect to
the rights of the holders of the Series A and B Stock after the recapitalization to the end that the
provisions of this Section 4 (including adjustment of the Conversion Price then in effect and the
number of shares purchasable upon conversion of the Series A and B Stock) shall be applicable

conversion of any share or shares of the Series A and B Stock, and the number of shares of
Common Stock to be issued shall be rounded up to the nearest whole share. Whether or not
fractional shares are issuable upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total
number of shares of Series A and B Stock the holder is at the time converting into Common
Stock and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such aggregate conversion.

(i) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Conversion Price of Series A and/or B Stock pursuant to this Section 4, the
Company, at its expense, shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in
accordance with the terms hereof and prepare and furnish to each holder of Series A and B

Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all
outstanding shares of the Series A and B Stock (including shares of Common Stock that may be
issued pursuant to Section 4(b)), and (ii) Series A and B Stock, solely for the purpose of
effecting the payment of the PIK Dividend, such number of its shares of Series A and B Stock
as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the payment of the PIK Dividend; and if at any
time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock or Series A and B Stock,
as applicable, shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the
Series A and B Stock or the payment of the PIK Dividend, as applicable, in addition to such
other remedies as shall be available to the holder of such Preferred Stock, the Company will
take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock and Series A and B Stock, as applicable, to
such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including, without limitation,
engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary
amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation.

notwithstanding any provision hereof, to notice of any stockholders’ meeting in accordance
with the bylaws of the Company, and shall be entitled to vote, together with holders of Common

number (with one-half being rounded upward).

not, without the written consent or affirmative vote of the Requisite Majority, given in writing

under Section 3 hereof on the applicable Optional Redemption Date (a “Redemption Breach”),
the number of directors constituting the Company's Board of Directors shall, at the request of
the holders of the Requisite Majority, be increased by such number which shall constitute a
minimum majority of the Board of Directors, and the holders of Series A and B Stock shall have
the special right, voting separately as a single class (with each share being entitled to one vote)
and to the exclusion of all other classes of the Company's capital stock, to elect individuals to
fill such newly created directorships, to remove any individuals elected to such directorships
and to fill any vacancies in such directorships. The special right of the holders of Series A and
B Stock to elect members of the Board of Directors may be exercised at a special meeting called
pursuant this Section 5(d), any annual or other special meeting of the stockholders and, to the
extent and in the manner permitted by applicable law, pursuant to a written consent in lieu ofa
stockholders meeting. Such special right shall continue until such time as there is no longer any
Event of Default in existence or when the Redemption Breach has been cured, at which time
such special right shall terminate subject to revesting upon the occurrence and continuation of
any Event of Default or Redemption Breach which gives rise to such special right hereunder.

A and B Stock, a proper officer of the Company shall, upon the written request of the Requisite
Majority, addressed to the secretary of the Company, call a special meeting of the holders of
Series A and B Stock for the purpose of electing directors pursuant to this subsection. Such
meeting shall be held at the earliest legally permissible date at the principal office of the
Company, or at such other place designated by the Requisite Majority. If such meeting has not
been called by a proper officer of the Company within 10 days after personal service of such
written request upon the secretary of the Company or within 20 days after mailing the same to
the secretary of the Company at its principal office, then the Requisite Majority may designate
in writing a person to call such meeting at the expense of the Company, and such meeting may
be called by such person so designated upon notice required for annual meetings of stockholders
and shall be held at the Company's principal office, or at such other place designated by the
Requisite Majority. Any person so designated shall be given access to the stock record books of

the Company for the purpose of causing a meeting of stockholders to be called pursuant to this
subsection.

holders of Series A and B Stock have the special right to elect directors pursuant to this Section
5(d), the presence in person or by proxy (or the written consent) of the holders of a majority of
the shares of Series A and B Stock then outstanding shall be required to constitute a quorum for
the election or removal of any director by the holders of the Series A and B Stock exercising
such special right. The vote of a majority of the shares of Series A and B Stock then
outstanding shall be required to elect or remove any such director.

(iv) | Any director so elected pursuant to this Section 5(d) shall continue to
serve as a director unti! the expiration of the lesser of (i) a period of one month following the
date on which there is no longer any Event of Default in existence or when the Redemption
Breach has been cured or (ii) the remaining period of the full term for which such director has
been elected. After the expiration of such period or when the full term for which such director
has been elected ceases (provided that the special right to elect directors has terminated), as the
case may be, the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors of the Company shall
decrease to such number as constituted the whole Board of Directors of the Company
immediately prior to the occurrence of the Event of Default or Redemption Breach giving rising
to the special right to elect directors.

Directors, and (ii) the presence in person or by proxy (or the written consent) of the holders of a
majority of the shares of the Common Stock then outstanding in the aggregate shall constitute a
quorum for the election of the Common Directors. A vacancy in any Series A and B Director
position by resignation, removal or other cause shall be filled, and a Series A and B Director
