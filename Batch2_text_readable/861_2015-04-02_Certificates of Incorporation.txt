(b) Liquidation Events

(i) Definition. For purposes of this Section 2, a “Liquidation Event" shall
mean; (A) the closing of the sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the
Corporation's assets (including an exclusive license with respect to all or substantially all of the
Corporation’s intellectual property); (B} the consummation of a merger, share exchange or
consolidation of the Corporation with or into another entity (except one in which the holders of
capital stock of the Corporation as constituted immediately prior to such merger, share exchange
or consolidation continue to hold a majority of the voting power of the capital stock of the
Corporation or the surviving or acquiring entity (or its parent entity)); (C) the transfer, in one
transaction or a series of related transactions, to a person or group of affiliated persons (other
than an underwriter of the Corporation's securities), of capital stock of the Corporation if, after
such transfer, such person or group of affiliated persons would hold 50% or more of the voting
power of the capital stock of the Corporation; or (D) a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of
the Corporation (whether voluntary or involuntary). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) a
transaction under (B) of the prior sentence shall not constitute a Liquidation Event if its purpose
is (x) to change the state of the Corporation's incorporation, or (y) to create a holding company
that will be owned in substantially the same proportions by the persons who held the
Corporation's securities immediately prior to such transaction; and (2) any transaction or event
otherwise constituting a Liquidation Event under this paragraph shall be deemed to be exempt
from such definition if (i) the holders of a majority of the then outstanding Preferred Stock
(voting together as a single voting group on an As Converted Basis) so agree by vote or written

-3e
LEGAL 1252269906
consent and (ii) the holders of a majority of the then outstanding Series D Preferred Stock, voting
as a separate series, so agree by vote or written consent.

(ii) Valuation of Consideration. If the consideration received in a
Liquidation Event is other than cash, its value will be deemed its fair market value as determined
in good faith by the Board. Any securities shal] be valued as follows:

(A) Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar
restrictions on free marketability:

(1) If traded on a securities exchange or a national quotation
system, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such
exchange or quotation system over the twenty trading-day period ending on the third trading day
prior to the closing;

(2) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the
twenty trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to the closing; and

(3) If there is no active public market, the value shall be the
fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Board and the holders of a majority of
the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (voting together as a single voting group on an As
Converted Basis).

{(B} = The method of valuation of securities subject to investment letter
or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of a
shareholder's status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount
from the market value determined as above in Section 2(b)(ii)(A) to reflect the approximate fair
market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board.

{C) The foregoing methods for valuing non-cash consideration to be
distributed in connection with a Liquidation Event shall, upon approval by the Corporation's
shareholders of the definitive agreements governing a Liquidation Event in accordance with
Section 4, be superseded by any determination of such value set forth in the definitive
agreements governing such Liquidation Event.

3. Conversion

The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have the right to convert their shares of Preferred
Stock into Class B Common Stock as provided in this Section 3.

(a) Voluntary Conversion

Subject to Section 3(c), each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the
option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share, at the office of
the Corporation or any transfer agent for such stock, into such number of fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Class B Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Liquidation
Amount for that series of Preferred Stock by the Conversion Price (as defined below) for that

LEGAL125226990.6
series of Preferred Stock in effect on the effective date of such conversion, as determined below.
The initial Series A Preferred Conversion Price shall be equal to the Series A Liquidation
Amount (the "Series A Conversion Price"), the initial Series B Preferred Conversion Price shall
be equal to the Series B Liquidation Amount (the "Series B Conversion Price"), the initial
Series C Preferred Conversion Price shall be equal to the Series C Liquidation Amount (the
"Series C Conversion Price") and the initial Series D Preferred Conversion Price shall be equal
to the Series D Liquidation Amount (the "Series D Conversion Price"), Such initial Series A
Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price and Series D
Conversion Price (as applicable, the "Applicable Conversion Price") shall be subject to
adjustment as set forth in Section 3(d).

(b) Automatic Conversion

Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of Class B
Common Stock at the Applicable Conversion Price at the time in effect for such share
immediately upon the earlier of (i) the date specified by the affirmative vote or consent of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (voting together as a single
voting group on an As Converted Basis), and (ii) the effective date of the registration statement
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), with respect to an
underwritten public offering of the Corporation's Class A Common Stock (a "Qualified Public
Offering"). Notwithstanding the forgoing, no shares of Series D Preferred shall be converted
into shares of Class B Common Stock pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 3(b) unless such
conversion is approved by the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Series D Preferred,

(c) Mechanics of Conversion

Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert such shares into shares
of Class B Common Stock under Section 3(a) above, such holder shall (i) either (A) surrender
the certificate or certificates for the shares to be converted, duly endorsed, at the office of the
Corporation or of any transfer agent for such series of Preferred Stock, or (B) notify the
Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and
execute an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss
incurred by it in connection with such certificates, and (ii) give written notice to the Corporation
at its principal corporate office of the election to convert such shares and shall state therein the
name or names in which the certificate or certificates for the shares of Class B Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion are to be issued. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable
thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or
nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Class B
Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled upon such conversion. Such conversion
shat! be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date on
which the requirements of the first sentence of this paragraph have been satisfied with respect to
the shares of such series of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to
receive the shares of Class B Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for
all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Class B Common Stock as of such
date. In connection with any automatic conversion of Preferred Stock under Section 3(b) above,
such conversion shall be deemed effective with respect to all shares of such Preferred Stock so

5x
LEGAL125226990.6
converted as of the effective date of the vote or consent referred to in clause (i) of such
subsection or the effective date of the Qualified Public Offering registration statement referred to
in clause (ii) of such subsection; provided, however, that if the automatic conversion is in
connection with a Qualified Public Offering, the conversion may, at the option of any holder
tendering such Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the
underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to such Qualified Public Offering, in which event
the person(s) entitled to receive the shares of Class B Common Stock issuable upon conversion
of such Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until
immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities. The Corporation shall, as soon as
practicable after the effective date of any automatic conversion, issue and deliver, at the
Corporation's principal corporate office, to each holder of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or
nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Class B
Common Stock to which such holder shail be entitled upon such conversion, subject to any such
holder first providing to the Corporation the documentation referred to in clauses (i)(A) or (i)(B)
of this paragraph. The person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Class B Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of
such shares of Class B Common Stock as of the effective date of conversion as provided above.

(d} Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock for Certain Dilutive
Issuances, Splits and Combinations

The Applicable Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock shal) be subject to
adjustment from time to time as follows:

(i) Issuance of Additional Stock below Purchase Price. If the Corporation
shalf issue, after the first issuance of shares of Series D Preferred (the “Purchase Date"), any
Additional Stock (as defined below) for a consideration per share less than the Applicable
Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to the issuance of
such Additional Stock, then, in each such case, the Applicable Conversion Price for such series
of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such issuance shall automatically be adjusted as
set forth in this Section 3(d)(t}, unless otherwise provided in this Section 3(d)(i).

(A) Adjustment Formula. Whenever the Applicable Conversion
Price for a given series of Preferred Stock is adjusted pursuant to this Section 3(d)(i), the new
Applicable Conversion Price shail be determined by multiplying the Applicable Conversion
Price in effect immediately prior to the issuance of Additional Stock by a fraction, (x) the
numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (or deemed to
be outstanding pursuant to Section 3(di)(E) below) immediately prior to such issuance (the
"Outstanding Common") plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate
consideration received by the Corporation for such issuance would purchase at such Applicable
Conversion Price; and (y) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of
Outstanding Common plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock.

(B) Definition of Additional Stock. For purposes of this
Section 3(d\(i), “Additional Stock" shall mean any shares of Common Stock issued (or deemed
to have been issued pursuant to Section 3(d)(i)(E)) by the Corporation after the Purchase Date,
other than:

or arrangements are (A) effected primarily for purposes other than raising equity capital and (B)
approved by the Board, including the Series A Director and the Series B Director.

(C) No Fractional Adjustments. No adjustment of the Applicable
Conversion Price for a series of Preferred Stock shall be made in an amount less than one
hundredth of a cent per share, provided that any adjustments that are not required to be made by
reason of this sentence shall be carried forward and shall be either taken into account in any
subsequent adjustment made prior to three years from the date of the event giving rise to the
adjustment being carried forward, or shall be made at the end of three years from the date of the
event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward.

(D) Determination of Consideration, In the case of the issuance of
Common Stock for cash, the consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid

LEGAL125226990.6
Corporation, In the case of the issuance of Common Stock for a consideration in whole or in
part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be deemed to be the fair value
thereof as determined in good faith by the Board irrespective of any accounting treatment.

{E) Deemed Issuances of Common Stock. In the case of the issuance
of options or warrants to purchase, or other rights to subscribe for, shares of Common Stock,
securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock (other than Class B

minimum additional consideration, if any, to be received by the Corporation (without taking into
account potential antidilution adjustments) upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or
the exercise of any related options, warrants or rights (the consideration in cach case to be
determined in the manner provided in Section 3(d)(i)(D)).

(3) In the event of any change in the number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon exercise of
such options, warrants or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such convertible or
exchangeable securities, including without limitation a change resulting from the antidilution

exchange of such securities or upon the exercise of the options, warrants or rights related to such
securities.

(5} The number of shares of Common Stock deemed issued
and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to Sections 3(d)(G)(E(1) and 3(d)(i}(E2)
shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or expiration of the type

series of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 3(d)(i) shall have the effect of increasing any
such Applicable Conversion Price,

holders of shares of such series of Preferred Stock.

shares of Class B Common Stock of the Corporation into which their shares of Preferred Stock
are convertible as of the record date fixed for the determination of the holders of Class B
Common Stock of the Corporation entitled to receive such distribution.

holder upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of
such series of Preferred Stock that the holder is at the time converting into Class B Common
