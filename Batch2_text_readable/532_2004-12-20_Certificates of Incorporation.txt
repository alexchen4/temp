to this Section 4 shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office
of the Company or any transfer agent for the Series D Preferred Stock, and shall give written
notice to the Company at such office that such holder elects to convert the same. Such notice
shall state the number of shares of Series D Preferred Stock being converted and whether the
Series D Preferred Stock is being converted into Series C Preferred Stock or Next Equity
Securities. Thereupon, the Company shall promptly issue and deliver at such office to such
holder a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Next Equity Securities or Series C
Preferred Stock, as ihe case may be, to which such holder is entitled and shall promptly pay in
cash (at the fair market value of such security determined by the Board of Directors as of the date
of such conversion) the value of any fractional share of Next Equity Securities or Series C
Preferred Stock, as the case may be, otherwise issuable to any holder of Series D Preferred
Stock. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made on the date of closing of the
transaction giving rise to the conversion, and the person entitled to receive the shares of Next
Equity Securities or Series C Preferred Stock, as the case may be, issuable upon such conversion
shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such shares of Next Equity Securities or
Series C Preferred Stock, as the case may be, on such date.

(ii) Each holder of Junior Series Proforred who desires to

convert the same into shares of Common Stock pursuant to this Section 4, shall surrender the
certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Company or any transfer

«10»
agent for the Junior Series Preferred, and shall give written notice to the Company at such office
that such holder elects to convert the same. Such notice shall state the number of shares of
Junior Series Preferred being converted. Thereupon, the Company shall promptly issue and
deliver at such office to such holder a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled and shall promptly pay (i) in cash or, to the
extent sufficient funds are not then legally available therefor, in Common Stock (at the Common
Stock’s fair market value determined by the Board of Directors as of the date of such
conversion), any declared and unpaid dividends on the shares of Junior Series Preferred being
converted and (ii) in cash (at the Common Stock’s fair market value determined by the Board of
Directors as of the date of conversion) the value of any fractional share of Common Stock
otherwise issuable to any holder of Junior Series Preferred. Such conversion shall be deemed to
have been made at the close of business on the date of such surrender of the certificates
representing the shares of Junior Series Preferred to be converted, or in the case of automatic
conversion pursuant to Section 4(1)(ii), on the date of closing of the offering or the date of the
affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares
of the Series C Preferred Stock, as applicable, and the person entitled to receive the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record
holder of such shares of Common Stock on such date. In addition, any optional conversion may —
be conditional upon the happening of a specific event, in which event the person(s) entitled to
receive Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of such Junior Series Preferred shall not
be deemed to have converted such Junior Series Preferred until immediately prior to the
happening of such event.

(e) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If at any time —
or from time to time after the Filing Date the Company effects a subdivision of the outstanding
Common Stock without a corresponding subdivision of the Series Preferred, the Series A
Preferred Conversion Price, Series B Preferred Conversion Price and Series C Preferred
Conversion Price in effect immediately before that subdivision shal] be proportionately
decreased. Conversely, if at any time or from time to time after the Filing Date the Company
combines the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares without a
corresponding combination of the Series Preferred, the Series A Preferred Conversion Price,
Series B Preferred Conversion Price and Series C Preferred Conversion Price in effect
immediately before the combination shall be proportionately increased. Any adjustment under

Securities the maximum number of Additional Shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise
or conversion thereof and to have received as consideration for the issuance of such shares an
amount equal to the total amount of the consideration, if any, received by the Company for the

the Company upon the cxercise or conversion of rights, options or Convertible Securitics is

options or the conversion privilege represented by any such Convertible Securities shall expire
without having been exercised, the Series A Preferred Conversion Price, Series B Preferred
Conversion Price or Series C Preferred Conversion Price as adjusted upon the issuance of such
rights, options or Convertible Securities shall be readjusted to the Series A Preferred Conversion
Price, Series B Preterred Conversion Price or Series C Preferred Conversion Price which would
