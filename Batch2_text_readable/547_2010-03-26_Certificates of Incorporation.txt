respectively, held by them, payable as set forth herein, out of funds legally available for that |
purpose. Such Accruing Dividends shall accrue annually on the first day of January of each year

assets of the Corporation shall be insufficient to permit the payment in full to the holders of
shares of Series D-1 Preferred Stock and Series C-1 Preferred Stock of all amounts distributable
to them under the foregoing sentence, then the entire assets of the Corporation available for such
distribution shall be distributed ratably among the holders of shares of Series D-1 Preferred
Stock and Series C-] Preferred Stock on a pari passu basis in proportion to the full preferential
amount each such holder would otherwise receive upon such distribution if all amounts payable

Stock and Series B-1 Preferred Stock (and, if Section 2(a) shall have ceased to be of any force or

receive, prior and in preference to any distribution of any of the assets or surplus funds of the
Corporation available for distribution to the holders of Common Stock by reason of their
ownership thereof, an amount equal to the greater of:

payable had each such share of Series B-1 Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock

converted to Common Stock basis and not as a separate series and (ii) a majority of the Series D-
1 Preferred Stock and the Series C-1 Preferred Stock then outstanding, voting together as a single
class and not as separate series, shall determine otherwise) (A) a merger or consolidation which
results in the holders of the voting securities of the Corporation outstanding immediately prior
thereto holding immediately thereafter Jess than a majority of the combined voting power of the
voting securities of the Corporation or such surviving or acquiring entity outstanding
immediately after such merger or consolidation; or (B) a sale of all or substantially all of the
assets of this Corporation. In any of such events, if the consideration received by this
Corporation is other than cash, its value will be deemed its fair market valuc. Any securities
shall be valued as follows:

(i) Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar
restrictions on free marketability covered by (ii) below:

National Market, the value shall be deerned to be the average of the closing prices of the
securities on such exchange or system over the thirty-day period ending three days prior to the

deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the
thirty-day period ending three days pnor to the closing; and

(C) If there is no active public market, the value shall be the
fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by this Corporation and the holders of at least

or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of a

3. Redemption.

(a) At any time after December 20, 2012, but within ninety days after the
receipt by this Corporation of a written request (a “Redemption Request”) from the holders of
not less than a majority of the Scries D-1 Preferred Stock, the Series C-1 Preferred Stock, the
Series B-1 Preferred Stock and the Series A-1 Preferred Stock then outstanding, acting together
as a single class on an as-converted to Common Stock basis and not as separate series (which
such majority shall include at least a majority of the Requisite Holders), that all or, if less than
all, a specified percentage of such holders’ shares of Preferred Stock be redeemed, and
concurrently with surrender by such holders of the certificates répresenting such shares, this
Corporation shall provide each other holder of Preferred Stock written notice of such
Redemption Request, such notice to be provided within ten (10) days of the date the Company
receives the Redemption Request and to include the number of shares to be redeemed and the
first Redemption Date, and, to the extent it may lawfully do so, redeem in three annual
installments (each payment date being referred to herein as a “Redemption Date”) the shares
specified in such Redemption Request and all other shares of Preferred Stock requested to be
redeemed by the holders of Preferred Stock in a written notice or notices provided to the
Company at least forty-five (45) days prior to the Redemption Date (and accompanied by such
holder’s certificates representing the shares to be redeemed) by paying in cash therefor an
amount per share equal to (1) in the case of the Series A-] Preferred Stock, the sum of (A)
$2.703955 per share (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividend, recapitalizations or the like
with respect to such shares occurring after the date hereof) plus (B) all declared but unpaid
dividends in respect of each such share then held by them (2) in the case of the Series B-1
Preferred Stock, the sum of (A) $1.649399 per share (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock
dividends, recapitalizations or the like with respect to such shares occurring after the date hereof)
plus (B) all declared but unpaid dividends on each such share, (3) in the case of the Series C-]
Preferred Stock, the sum of (A) $1.649399 per share (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock
dividends, recapitalizations or the like with respect to such shares occurring after the date
hereof), plus (B) the Series C-1 Accming Dividends per share plus (C) all declared but unpaid
dividends on each such share and (4) in the case of the Series D-1 Preferred Stock, the sum of
(A) $3.005648 per share (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations or
the like with respect to such shares occurring after the date hereof), plus (B) the Series D-1
Accruing Dividends per share plus (C) all declared but unpaid dividends on each such share (in
each case, the “Redemption Price”). The number of shares of Preferred Stock that this
Corporation shall be required to redeem on any one Redemption Date shall be equal to the
amount determined by dividing (x) the aggregate number of shares-of Preferred Stock: -- ~~
outstanding immediately prior to such Redemption Date that have been requested to be redeemed
pursuant to this Section 3(a) by (y) the number of remaining Redemption Dates (including the
Redemption Date to which such calculation applies). Upon any redemption under this Section 3,
each series of Preferred Stock shall rank upon redemption in the same priority as such series of
Preferred Stock ranks upon a liquidation, dissolution and winding up of the Corporation as set

6

#213488) v2 18452 0%)

forth in Section 2. No amounts shall be paid to a series of Preferred Stock ranking upon
liquidation junior to another series of Preferred Stock unless the redemption payments
contemplated by this Section 3 shall have been first made to all of the outstanding shares of the
senior series of Preferred Stock. Subject to the foregoing, any redemption of shares of Preferred
Stock effected pursuant to this subsection 3(a) shall be made on a pro rata basis among the
holders of shares of Preferred Stock in proportion to the number of shares proposed to be
redeemed by such holders. Should any redemption installment not be paid on the applicable
Redemption Date, then such redemption installment shall bear simple interest at one percent
(1%) per month from such Redemption Date; provided, however, that no interest shall accrue on
any redemption installment to the extent that the Corporation is not legally permitted to pay such
redemption installment.

(b) At least fifteen but no more than thirty days prior to each Redemption
Date, written notice shall be mailed, first class postage prepaid, to each holder of record (at the
close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given) of
Preferred Stock to be redeemed, at the address last shown on the records of this Corporation for
such holder, notifying such holder of the redemption to be effected on the applicable Redemption
Date, specifying the number of shares to be redeemed from such holder, the Redemption Date,
the Redemption Price, the place at which payment may be obtained and calling upon such holder
to surrender to this Corporation, in the manner and at the place designated, his, her or its
certificate or certificates representing the shares to be redeemed (the “Redemption Notice”).
Except as provided in subsection 3(c), on or after each Redemption Date, each holder of shares
of Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such Redemption Date shall surrender to this Corporation
the certificate or certificates representing such shares, in the manner and at the place designated
in the Redemption Notice, and thereupon the applicable Redemption Price of such shares shall
be payable to the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as
the owner thereof and each surrendered certificate shall be cancelled. In the event less than all
the shares represented by any such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued
representing the unredeemed shares.

(c) | From and after each Redemption Date, unless there shall have been a
default in payment of the Redemption Price, all rights of the holders of shares of Preferred Stock
designated for redemption on such Redemption Date in the Redemption Notice as holders of
shares of Preferred Stock (except the right to receive the applicable Redemption Price without
interest upon surrender of their certificate or certificates) shall cease with respect to such shares,
and such shares shall not thereafter be transferred on the books of this Corporation or be deemed
to be outstanding for any purpose whatsoever. If the funds of this Corporation legally available
for redemption of shares of Preferred Stock on a Redemption Date are insufficient to redeem the
total number of shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such date, those funds that are
legally available will be used to redeem the maximum possible number of such shares of each
series of Preferred Stock in the same priority as such series of Preferred Stock ranks upon a
liquidation, dissolution and winding up of the Corporation as sct forth in Section 2 and then
ratably among the holders of shares of any series of Preferred Stock ranking pari passu on the
basis of the number of such shares which would be redeemed on such date if the funds of this
Corporation legally available therefor had been sufficient to redeem all shares required to be
redeemed on such date. The shares of Preferred Stock not redeemed shall remain outstanding
and entitled to all the rights and preferences provided herein. At any time thereafter when

7

#2194881 v2 018452 0301
additional funds of this Corporation are legally available for the redemption of shares of
Preferred Stock, such funds will be used to redeem the balance of the shares that this Corporation
has become obliged to redeem on any Redemption Date but that it has not redeemed, and such
redemption shall occur based on the priorities set forth above as soon as practicable after such
additional funds become legally available.

4. Conversion. The holders of Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as

follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at
the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share and on or
prior to the fifth day prior to the Redemption Date, if any, as may have been fixed in any
Redemption Notice with respect to such share of the Preferred Stock, at the office of this
Corporation or any transfer agent for such stock, into such number of fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing (1) iri the case of the Series
A-1 Preferred Stock, $2.703955 (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividend,
recapitalizations or the like with respect to such shares occurring after the date hereof) by the
Series A-1 Conversion Price (as defined below) in effect on the date the certificate is surrendered
for conversion, (2) in the case of Serics B-1 Preferred Stock $1.649399 (as adjusted for any stock
splits, stock dividend, recapitalizations or the like with respect to such shares occurring after the
date hereof) by the Series B-1 Conversion Price (as defined below) in effect on the date the
certificate is surrendered for conversion, (3) in the case of Series C-1] Preferred Stock, $1.649399
(as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividend, recapitalizations or the like with respect to such
shares occurring after the date hereof) by the Series C-1 Conversion Price (as defined below) in
effect on the date the certificate is surrendered for conversion and (4) in the case of Series D-1
Preferred Stock, $3.005648 (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividend, recapitalizations or
the like with respect to such shares occurring after the date hereof) by the Series D-1 Conversion
Price (as defined below) in effect on the date the certificate is surrendered for conversion. The
initial Conversion Price per share for shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock shall be $2.703955,
the initial Conversion Price per share for shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock and Series C-1
Preferred Stock shall be $1.649399 and the initial Conversion Price per share for shares of Series
D-1 Preferred Stock shall be $3.005648 (each, a “(Conversion Price,” and specifically, the
“Series A-1 Conversion Price”, the “Series B-1 Conversion Price”, the “Series C-] Conversion
Price” and the “Series D-1 Conversion Price”, respectively); provided, however, that the
Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in
subsection 4(d).

(b) Automatic Conversion.

(i) Each share of Series D-] Preferred Stock and Series C-1 Preferred
Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the applicable
-. Conversion Price then in effect immediately upon-the earlier of (A) this Corporation’s initial.sale
of its Common Stock in a firm commitment underwritten public offering (an “Initial Public
Offering”), which Initial Public Offering shall result in not less than $25,000,000 of net proceeds
to the corporation, and the public offering price of which is not less than $5.00 per share (as
adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations or the like), or (B) the date
specified by written consent or agreement of the holders of at least 66-2/3% of the Series D-1

8

0219483] v2 1018452 00}
Preferred Stock and Series C-1 Preferred Stock then outstanding, voting together as a single class
on an as-converted to Common Stock basis and not as separate series.

(ii) | Each share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock and Serics B-1 Preferred
Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the applicable
Conversion Price then in effect for such series immediately upon the earlier of (A) this
Corporation’s Initial Public Offering, which Initial Public Offering shall result in not less than
$25,000,000 of net proceeds to the corporation, and the public offering price of which is not less
than $5.00 per share (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations or the
like), or (B) the date specified by written consent or agreement of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding Series A-1 Preferred Stock and Series B-1 Preferred Stock, voting together as a
single class on an as-converted to Common Stock basis and not as separate series.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock, he or she shall surrender the
certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of this Corporation or of any
transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to this Corporation at its
principal corporate office, of the election to convert the same and shall state therein the name or
names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued. This
Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such
holder of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as
aforesaid. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of
business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the
person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion
shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock
as of such date. If the conversion is in connection with an Initial Public Offering, the conversion
may, at the option of any holder tendering Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon
the closing with the underwniters of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering, in which
event the persons entitled to receive the Common Stock upon conversion of the Preferred Stock
shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the
closing of such sale of securities.

(d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock for Certain Dilutive
Issuances, Splits and Combinations. The Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock

shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

(i) Adjustment of Series A-1 Conversion Price, Senes B-1 Conversion
Price, Series C-1 Conversion Price and Series D-] Conversion Price upon Issuance of Additional
Stock. Ifat any time after the date hereof, this Corporation shall issue any Additional Stock (as
defined in subsection 4(d)(iv) below) without consideration or for a consideration per share less
than the Series D-1. Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance, the Series A-1
Conversion Price, Series B-1 Conversion Price, Series C-1 Conversion Price and Series D-1
Conversion Price shall each forthwith be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price
determined by dividing (i) an amount equal to the sum of (a) the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance (including shares of Common Stock
deemed to be issued pursuant to subsection 4(d)(1ii)(D){1) or (2)) multiplied by the then

9

#2194881 v2 018452 0301
applicable Conversion Price and (b) the aggregate consideration, if any, received by this
Corporation upon such issuance by (ii) the sum of (a) the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such issuance (including shares of Common Stock deemed to
be issued pursuant to subsection 4(d)(iii)(D)(1) or (2)) and (b) the number of shares of such
Additional Stock.

(i) Node Minimus Adjustments. No adjustment of the Conversion
Price for any series of Preferred Stock shall be made in an amount less than one cent per share,
provided that any adjustments that are not required to be made by reason of this sentence shall be

the State of Delaware, as those laws may be amended and supplemented from time to time,
indemnify any current or former director, officer, employee and/or agent made, or threatened to
be made, a party to an action or proceeding, whether criminal, civil, administrative or
investigative, by reason of serving or having served as a director, officer and/or employee of the
Corporation or a predecessor corporation or, at the Corporation’s request, a director or officer of
another corporation, provided, however, that the Corporation shall indemnify any such agent in
connection with a proceeding initiated by such agent only if such proceeding was authorized by
the Board of Directors of the Corporation. The indemnification provided for in this Article
Tenth shall: (i) not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those indemnified may be
entitled under any bylaw, agreement or vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or
otherwise, both as to action in their official capacities and as to action in another capacity while
holding such office, (ii) continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer,
employee and/or agent, as the case may be, and (iii) inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors
and administrators of such a person. The Corporation’s obligation to provide indemnification
under this Article Tenth shall be offset to the extent of any other source of indemnification or
any otherwise applicable insurance coverage under a policy maintained by the Corporation or
any other person.

Expenses incurred by a director of the Corporation in defending a civil or criminal action,
suit or proceeding by reason of the fact that he is or was a director of the Corporation (or was
serving at the Corporation’s request as a director or officer of another corporation) shall be paid
by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon
receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director to repay such amount if it shall
ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as
authorized by relevant sections of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation shall not be required to advance such expenses
to an agent who is a party to an action, suit or proceeding brought by the Corporation and

approved by a majority of the Board of Directors of the Corporation which alleges willful
misappropriation of corporate assets by such agent, disclosure of confidential information in
violation of such agent’s fiduciary or contractual obligations to the Corporation or any other
willful and deliberate breach in bad faith of such agent’s duty to the Corporation or its
stockholders.

The foregoing provisions of this Article Tenth shall be deemed to be a contract between
the Corporation and each director, officer, employee and/or agent who serves in such capacity,
and any repeal or modification thereof shall not affect any rights or obligations then existing with
respect to any state of facts then or theretofore existing or any action, suit or proceeding
theretofore or thereafter brought based in whole or in part upon any such state of facts.
