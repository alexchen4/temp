Terms of Conversion.

4.3.4.1.1 Optional Conversion. The holder of each share of Series A Preferred
shall have the right (the "Series A Conversion Right"), at such holder's option, to
convert such share at any time, without cost and otherwise on the terms of this
Section 4.3.4, into the number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common
that results from dividing:

(A) $1.00,

by:

(B) the Series A Conversion Price (as defined below) in effect at the time of
conversion.

The "Series A Conversion Price" as of the date of the filing of this Restated
Certificate (the “Filing Date”) shall be $22.6272 and shall be subject to
adjustment from time to time as provided in this Section 4.3.4.

4.3.4.1.2 Mandatory Conversion. All of the outstanding Series A Preferred
shall, without any further action by a holder thereof, convert into Common (a
"Series A Mandatory Conversion") upon the first to occur of the following (each
a "Series A Mandatory Conversion Event"): (A) the Company's Qualified Public
Offering (as defined below), (B) at such time as at least two-thirds of the aggregate
number of shares of Series A Preferred issued prior to such time have been
voluntarily converted into Common by the holders thereof, (C) at such time as is

(A) that such holder elects to convert the same,
(B) the number of shares of Series A Preferred being converted, and

{C) the name or names in which such holder wishes the certificate or
certificates for shares of Common to be issued.

Thereupon the Company shall promptly issue and deliver to the holder of such
shares, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates
for the number of shares of Common to which such holder shall be entitled. If
the certificate evidencing the shares of Series A Preferred being converted shail
also evidence shares of Series A Preferred not being converted, then the
Company shall also deliver to the holder of such certificate, or to the nominee or
nominees of such holder, a new stock certificate evidencing the Series A
Preferred not converted. Any dividends or distributions declared but unpaid at
the time of conversion with respect to a share of Series A Preferred so converted
shall be payable ratably to the holders of the Common issued upon such
conversion.

4.3.4.2.2 | Mandatory Conversion. The Company shall give written notice to
each holder of a share of Series A Preferred (A) not more than forty (40) nor less
than twenty (20) days before the anticipated effective date of the registration
statement with respect to any Qualified Public Offering, and shall also give written
notice to each such holder upon the occurrence of any Qualified Public Offering:
and (B) upon the occurrence of any other Series A Mandatory Conversion Event.
Followimg the conversion of such shares, each holder of shares so converted may
surrender the certificate therefor at the office of the Company or any transfer agent
for the Series A Preferred. Upon such surrender, the Company shall issue and
deliver to each holder, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate
or certificates for the number of shares of Common to which such holder is
entitled. Any dividends or distributions declared but unpaid at the time of
conversion with respect to a share of Series A Preferred so converted shall be
payable ratably to the holders of the Common issued upon such conversion.

Effective Date of Conversion.

4.3.4.3.1 Optional Conversion. The conversion of any shares of Series A
Preferred shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of
business on the date that the shares to be converted are surrendered to the Company

4.3.4.3.2 Mandatory Conversion. The conversion of shares of Series A
Preferred shall take place upon the first to occur of the Series A Mandatory
Conversion Events, whether or not the certificates representing such shares of
Series A Preferred shall have been surrendered, or new certificates representing the
shares of Common into which such shares have been converted shall have been
issued.

Adjustment of Conversion Price.

4.3.4.4.1 Subdivision or Combination of Shares. If the Company at any time
subdivides or combines the outstanding Common after the Filing Date, the Series A
Conversion Price shall be decreased, in the case of a subdivision, or increased, in
the case of a combination, in the same proportions as the Common is subdivided or
combined, effective automatically as of the date the Company shall take a record of
the holders of its Common for the purpose of the subdivision or combination (or if
no such record is taken, as of the effectiveness of the subdivision or combination).

4.3.4.4.2 Stock Dividends. If the Company at any time pays a dividend, or
makes any other distribution, to holders of Common payable in shares of Common,
or fixes a record date for the determination of holders of Common entitled to
receive a dividend or other distribution payable in shares of Common, the Series A
Conversion Price shal] be decreased by multiplying it by a fraction:

(A) the numerator of which shal] be the total number of shares of Common
outstanding immediately prior to such dividend or distribution, and

(B) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common
outstanding immediately after such dividend or distribution (plus, if the
Company paid cash instead of fractional shares otherwise issuable in such
dividend or distribution, the number of additional shares which would have been
outstanding had the Company issued fractional shares instead of cash),

effective automatically as of the date the Company shall take a record of the
holders of its Common for the purpose of receiving such dividend or distribution
(or if no such record is taken, as of the effectiveness of such dividend or
distribution).

4.3443 Reclassification, Consolidation or Merger. If at any time, as a result
of:

(A) a capital reorganization or reclassification (other than a subdivision,
combination or dividend which gives rise to adjustment of the Series A
Conversion Price pursuant to Sections 4.3.4.4.1 or 4.3.4.4.2), or

(B) a merger or consolidation of the Company with another corporation
(whether or not the Company is the surviving corporation),

the Common issuable upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred shall be
changed into or exchanged for the same or a different number of shares of any
class or classes of stock of the Company or any other corporation, or other
LJH 2AF1T4Q

-8-

securities convertible into such shares, then, as a part of such reorganization,
reclassification, merger or consolidation, appropriate adjustments shall be made
in the terms of the Series A Preferred (or of any securities into which the Series
A Preferred is changed or for which the Series A Preferred is exchanged), so that:

(X) the holders of Series A Preferred or of such substitute securities shall
thereafter be entitled to receive, upon conversion of the Series A Preferred or of
such substitute securities, the kind and amount of shares of stock, other
securities, money and property which such holders would have received at the
time of such capital reorganization, reclassification, merger, or consolidation, if
such holders had converted their Series A Preferred into Common immediately
prior to such capital reorganization, reclassification, merger, or consolidation,
and

(Y) the Series A Preferred or such substitute securities shall thereafter be
adjusted on terms as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments
theretofore provided in this Section 4.3.4.4.

The provisions of this Section 4.3.4.4.3 shall similarly apply to successive capital
reorganizations, reclassifications, mergers, and consolidations.

approval of at least three Investor Members (as such term is defined in

(B) If at any time the Company issues (or is deemed by the express
provisions of Section 4.3.4.4.5 to have issued or sold) Additional Shares of
Common without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the
lower of (i) the Series A Conversion Price in effect at such issuance or (ii) the
Series D-1 Conversion Price (as defined below) in effect at such issuance, then
the Series A Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issuance,
to a price (calculated to the nearest cent) equal to the price determined by

Additional Shares of Common plus the number of shares of Common

provided, however, that in no event shall the Series A Conversion Price be
reduced below $0.01.

exercise price (or into or for a corresponding number of shares of Common)
which may not be determined at the time of the determination under Section

reflecting: (i) if such Convertible Securities have a provision which contains a
price or rate which is fixed or can be fixed as of the date of the determination
under Section 4.3.4.4.4(B), then such price or rate or (ii) otherwise, at the price of
securities issued in the Company’s most recent equity financing.

instruments relating thereto, giving effect to any provision contained therein for a
subsequent upward adjustment of such number) issuable upon exercise or
conversion thereof and to have received as consideration therefor an amount
equal to the total amount of the consideration, if any, received by the Company
for the issuance of such Convertible Securities plus the minimum amounts of
consideration, if any (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, giving effect
to any provision contained therein for a subsequent downward adjustment of
such consideration), payable to the Company upon the exercise or conversion of
such Convertible Securities and the minimum amounts of consideration, if any,
payable to the Company (other than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations
evidenced by such Convertible Securities which were deemed to have been
received by the Company on issuance of such Convertible Securities) upon the
exercise of any Convertible Securities issuable upon the exercise or conversion
of such Convertible Securities. No further adjustment of the Conversion Price
for Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred, Series C Preferred, Series D Preferred

such Convertible Securities; provided, however, that if the Convertible Securities
or the conversion privilege represented by any such Convertible Securities shall
expire without having been exercised, or are exercised for a lesser number of

were issued or sold for the consideration actually received by the Company upon
such exercise, plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the Company

options, whether or not exercised, plus the consideration received for issuing or
selling the Convertible Securities actually converted plus the consideration, if

obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities which were deemed to have
been received by the Company on issuance of such Convertible Securities) on the
conversion of such Convertible Securities.

amount of such dividends for all shares of Common into which each such share of Series B
Preferred could then be converted (assuming, for the purposes of calculating the amount of
dividends to be paid under this section, in the case of dividends declared on shares of Series A
Preferred, that such shares of Series A Preferred had been converted into shares of Common
and such dividends had been declared on the shares of Common issued upon conversion
thereof).

4.4.2.3 In the event any dividend or other distribution payable in cash or other property
(other than securities of the Company the issuance of which gives rise to adjustments pursuant
to Section 4.4.4.4 of this Restated Certificate) is declared on any Common, each holder of

of Series B Preferred issued prior to such time have been voluntarily converted into
Common by the holders thereof, (C) at such time as is specified in a vote or written
consent of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Series B
Preferred, or (D) at such time as is specified in a vote or written consent of the

4.4.4.3

4.4.4.4

- 18 -

for the number of shares of Common to which such holder shall be entitled. If
the certificate evidencing the shares of Series B Preferred being converted shall
also evidence shares of Series B Preferred not being converted, then the
Company shall also deliver to the holder of such certificate, or to the nominee or
nominees of such holder, a new stock certificate evidencing the Series B
Preferred not converted. Any dividends or distributions declared but unpaid at
the time of conversion with respect to a share of Series B Preferred so converted
shall be payable ratably to the holders of the Common issued upon such
conversion.

4.4.4.2.2 Mandatory Conversion. The Company shall give written notice to
each holder of a share of Series 3 Preferred (A) not more than forty (40) nor less
than twenty (20) days before the anticipated effective date of the registration

notice to each such holder upon the occurrence of any Qualified Public Offering;
and (B) upon the occurrence of any other Series B Mandatory Conversion Event.
Following the conversion of such shares, each holder of shares so converted may
surrender the certificate therefor at the office of the Company or any transfer agent
for the Series B Preferred. Upon such surrender, the Company shall issue and
deliver to each holder, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate
or certificates for the number of shares of Common to which such holder is
entitled. Any dividends or distributions declared but unpaid at the time of
conversion with respect to a share of Series B Preferred so converted shall be
payable ratably to the holders of the Common issued upon such conversion.

Effective Date of Conversion.

4.4.4.3.1 Optional Conversion. The conversion of any shares of Series B
Preferred shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of
business on the date that the shares to be converted are surrendered to the Company
together with the notice required by Section 4.4.4.2.1, and the person or persons
entitled to receive the shares of Common issuable upon such conversion shall be
treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common
on such date.

4.4.4.3.2 Mandatory Conversion. The conversion of shares of Series B
Preferred shall take place upon the first to occur of the Series B Mandatory
Conversion Events, whether or not the certificates representing such shares of
Series B Preferred shall have been surrendered, or new certificates representing the
shares of Common into which such shares have been converted shall have been
issued.

Adjustment of Conversion Price.

4.4.4.4.1 Subdivision or Combination of Shares. If the Company at any time
subdivides or combines the outstanding Common after the Filing Date, the Series B
Conversion Price shall be decreased, in the case of a subdivision, or increased, in
the case of a combination, in the same proportions as the Common is subdivided or
combined, effective automatically as of the date the Company shall take a record of

H1# 247148

the holders of its Common for the purpose of the subdivision or combination (or if
no such record is taken, as of the effectiveness of the subdivision or combination).

4444.2 Stock Dividends. If the Company at any time pays a dividend, or
makes any other distribution, to holders of Common payable in shares of Common,
or fixes a record date for the determination of holders of Common entitled to
receive a dividend or other distribution payable in shares of Common, the Series B
Conversion Price shall be decreased by multiplying it by a fraction:

(A) _ the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common
outstanding immediately prior to such dividend or distribution, and

(B) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common
outstanding immediately after such dividend or distribution (plus, if the
Company paid cash instead of fractional shares otherwise tssuable in such
dividend or distribution, the number of additional shares which would have been
outstanding had the Company issued fractional shares instead of cash),

effective automatically as of the date the Company shall take a record of the
holders of its Common for the purpose of receiving such dividend or distribution
(or if no such record is taken, as of the effectiveness of such dividend or
distribution).

4.4.4.43 Reclassification, Consolidation or Merger. If at any time, as a result
of:

(A) a capital reorganization or reclassification (other than a subdivision,
combination or dividend which gives rise to adjustment of the Series B
Conversion Price pursuant to Sections 4.4.4.4.1 or 4.4.4.4.2), or

(B) a merger or consolidation of the Company with another corporation
(whether or not the Company is the surviving corporation),

the Common issuable upon the conversion of the Series B Preferred shall be
changed into or exchanged for the same or a different number of shares of any
class or classes of stock of the Company or any other corporation, or other
securities convertible into such shares, then, as a part of such reorganization,
reclassification, merger or consolidation, appropriate adjustments shall be made
in the terms of the Series B Preferred (or of any securities into which the Series B
Preferred is changed or for which the Series B Preferred is exchanged), so that:

(X) the holders of Series B Preferred or of such substitute securities shall
thereafter be entitled to receive, upon conversion of the Series B Preferred or of
such substitute securities, the kind and amount of shares of stock, other
securities, money and property which such holders would have received at the
time of such capital reorganization, reclassification, merger, or consolidation, if
such holders had converted their Series B Preferred into Common immediately
prior to such capital reorganization, reclassification, merger, or consolidation,
and
#347148

-20-

(Y) the Series B Preferred or such substitute securities shall thereafter be
adjusted on terms as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments
theretofore provided in this Section 4.4.4.4.

reorganizations, reclassifications, mergers, and consolidations.

is deemed by the express provisions of Section 4.3.4.4.5 to have issued or sold)
Additional Shares of Common without consideration or for a consideration per
share less than the Jower of (i) the Series B Conversion Price in effect at such
issuance or (ii) the Series D-1 Conversion Price in effect at such issuance, then the
Series B Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issuance, to a
price (calculated to the nearest cent) equal to the price determined by multiplying
the Series B Conversion Price by a fraction:

{A) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common
Outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Shares of
Common plus the number of shares of Common which the aggregate
consideration received (or by the express provisions hereof deemed to have been
received) by the Company for the total number of such Additional Shares of
Common so issued would purchase at the Series B Conversion Price, and

(B) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common
Outstanding immediately after the issuance of such Additional Shares of
Common;

provided, however, that in no event shall the Series B Conversion Price be
reduced below $0.01.

4.4.4.4.5 Convertible Securities. For purposes of the adjustment required under
Section 4.4.4.4.4, Convertible Securities shall be treated as described in Section
43.445,

distribution of its assets to the holders of its Common as a dividend in liquidation
or partial liquidation or by way of return of capital or other than as a dividend
payable out of funds legally available for dividends under the laws of the State of
Delaware, the holders of the Series B Preferred shall be entitled to receive, without
payment of any consideration therefor, the assets that would have been payable to
them as owners of that number of shares of Common receivable by exercise of such
Series B Conversion Rights, had they been the holders of record of such Common

4.4.5

H#H AAT1AR

-2)]-

on the record date for such distribution; and an appropriate provision therefor shall
be made a part of any such distribution in accordance with the preferential
provisions of Section 4.4.3 of this Restated Certificate.

44.4.5 Reservation of Shares. The Company will take such corporate action as may be
necessary from time to time so that at all times it will have authorized, and reserved out of its

shall have the right (the "Series D Conversion Right"), at such holder's option, to
convert such share at any time, without cost and otherwise on the terms of this
Section 4.6.4, into the number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common

H# 347148

-35-

Offering, (B) at such time as at least the Series D/D-1 Approval Amount issued
prior to such time have been voluntarily converted into Common by the holders
thereof, (C) at such time as is specified in a vote or written consent of the holders
of at least the Series D/D-1 Approval Amount, or (D) at such time as is specified in
a vote or written consent of the holders of at least the Series D/D-1 Approval
Amount with respect to the conversion of all Preferred into Common. In each case,
each share of Series D Preferred shall be automatically converted, without cost, on
the terms of this Section 4.7.4, into the number of shares of Common into which
such share of Series D Preferred would be convertible under 4.6.4.1.1 immediately
prior to such conversion.

Mechanics of Conversion.

4.6.4.2.1 Optional Conversion. A holder of any share of Series D Preferred may
exercise the Series D Conversion Right of such share by surrendering the certificate
therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Company or of any transfer agent for
the Series D Preferred, together with a written notice to the Company which states:

(A) that such holder elects to convert the same,
(B) the number of shares of Series D Preferred being converted, and

{C) the name or names in which such holder wishes the certificate or
certificates for shares of Common to be issued.

Thereupon the Company shall promptly issue and deliver to the holder of such
shares, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates
for the number of shares of Common to which such holder shall be entitled. If
the certificate evidencing the shares of Series D Preferred being converted shall
also evidence shares of Series D Preferred not being converted, then the
Company shall also deliver to the holder of such certificate, or to the nominee or
nominees of such holder, a new stock certificate evidencing the Series D
Preferred not converted. Any dividends or distributions declared but unpaid at
the time of conversion with respect to a share of Series D Preferred so converted
shall be payable ratably to the holders of the Common issued upon such
conversion, pari passu with the payment of such dividends or distributions
pursuant to Section 4.7.4.2.1.

4.6.4.2.2 Mandatory Conversion. The Company shall give written notice to
each holder of a share of Series D Preferred (A) not more than forty (40) nor less
than twenty (20) days before the anticipated effective date of the registration
statement with respect to any Qualified Public Offering, and shall also give written
notice to each such holder upon the occurrence of any Qualified Public Offering;
and (B) upon the occurrence of any other Series D Mandatory Conversion Event.
Following the conversion of such shares, each holder of shares so converted may
surrender the certificate therefor at the office of the Company or any transfer agent
for the Series D Preferred. Upon such surrender, the Company shall issue and
deliver to each holder, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate
or certificates for the number of shares of Common to which such holder ts
entitled. Any dividends or distributions declared but unpaid at the time of

TlH 2ATF14Q

4.6.4.3

conversion with respect to a share of Series D Preferred so converted shall be
payable ratably to the holders of the Common issued upon such conversion, pari
passu with the payment of such dividends or distributions payable pursuant to
Section 4.7.4.2.2.

Effective Date of Conversion.

4.6.4.3.1 Optional Conversion. The conversion of any shares of Series D
Preferred shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of
business on the date that the shares to be converted are surrendered to the Company
together with the notice required by Section 4.6.4.2.1, and the person or persons
entitled to receive the shares of Common issuable upon such conversion shall be
treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common
on such date.

4.6.4.3.2 Mandatory Conversion. The conversion of shares of Series D
Preferred shall take place upon the first to occur of the Series D Mandatory
Conversion Events, whether or not the certificates representing such shares of
Series D Preferred shall have been surrendered, or new certificates representing the
shares of Common into which such shares have been converted shall have been
issued.

Adjustment of Conversion Price.

4.6.4.4.1_ Subdivision or Combination of Shares. If the Company at any time
subdivides or combines the outstanding Common after the Filing Date, the Series D
Conversion Price shall be decreased, in the case of a subdivision, or increased, in
the case of a combination, in the same proportions as the Common is subdivided or
combined, effective automatically as of the date the Company shall take a record of
the holders of its Common for the purpose of the subdivision or combination (or if
no such record is taken, as of the effectiveness of the subdivision or combination).

4.6.4.4.2 Stock Dividends. If the Company at any time pays a dividend, or
makes any other distribution, to holders of Common payable in shares of Common,
or fixes a record date for the determination of holders of Common entitled to
receive a dividend or other distribution payable in shares of Common, the Series D
Conversion Price shall be decreased by multiplying it by a fraction:

(A) _ the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common
outstanding immediately prior to such dividend or distribution, and

(B) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common
outstanding immediately after such dividend or distribution (plus, if the
Company paid cash instead of fractional shares otherwise issuable in such
dividend or distribution, the number of additional shares which would have been
outstanding had the Company issued fractional shares instead of cash),

effective automatically as of the date the Company shall take a record of the
holders of its Common for the purpose of receiving such dividend or distribution
T4# 2ATLAR

~37-

(or if no such record is taken, as of the effectiveness of such dividend or
distribution).

4.6.4.4.3 Reclassification, Consolidation or Merger. If at any time, as a result
of:

(A) a capital reorganization or reclassification (other than a subdivision,
combination or dividend which gives rise to adjustment of the Series D
Conversion Price pursuant to Sections 4.6.4.4.1 or 4.6.4.4.2), or

(B) a merger or consolidation of the Company with another corporation
(whether or not the Company is the surviving corporation),

the Common issuable upon the conversion of the Series D Preferred shall be
changed into or exchanged for the same or a different number of shares of any
class or classes of stock of the Company or any other corporation, or other
securities convertible into such shares, then, as a part of such reorganization,
reclassification, merger or consolidation, appropriate adjustments shall be made
in the terms of the Series D Preferred (or of any securities into which the Series
D Preferred is changed or for which the Series D Preferred is exchanged), so that:

(X) the holders of Series D Preferred or of such substitute securities shall
thereafter be entitled to receive, upon conversion of the Series D Preferred or of
such substitute securities, the kind and amount of shares of stock, other
securities, money and property which such holders would have received at the
time of such capital reorganization, reclassification, merger, or consolidation, if
such holders had converted their Series D Preferred into Common immediately
prior to such capital reorganization, reclassification, merger, or consolidation,
and

(Y) the Series D Preferred or such substitute securities shall thereafter be
adjusted on terms as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments
theretofore provided in this Section 4.6.4.4.

The provisions of this Section 4.6.4.4.3 shall similarly apply to successive capital
reorganizations, reclassifications, mergers, and consolidations.

4.6.4.4.4 Additional Shares of Common.

equity securities (inclusive of the shares of Series D-1 Preferred issued
pursuant to the Series D-1 Purchase Agreement) (the earlier of (i) and (ii),
the “Dilution Lapse Date”), the Company issues (or is deemed by the
express provisions of Section 4.3.4.4.5 to have issued or sold) Additional
Shares of Common without consideration or for a consideration per share
less than the Series D Conversion Price in effect at such issuance, then the
Series D Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issuance,
to a price equal to the consideration per share of such Additional Shares of
LIF QATAR

4.6.4.5

-38-

Common; provided, however, that in no event shall the Series D Conversion
Price be reduced below $0.01.

(b) If at any time after the Dilution Lapse Date, the Company issues (or is
deemed by the express provisions of Section 4.3.4.4.5 to have issued or sold)
Additional Shares of Common without consideration or for a consideration
per share less than the lower of (i) the Series D Conversion Price in effect at
such issuance or (ii) the Series D-1 Conversion Price in effect at such
issuance, then the Series D Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently
with such issuance, to a price (calculated to the nearest cent) equal to the
price determined by multiplymg the Series D Conversion Price by a fraction:

(A) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common
Outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Shares of
Common plus the number of shares of Common which the aggregate
consideration received (or by the express provisions hereof deemed to have been
received) by the Company for the total number of such Additional Shares of
Common so issued would purchase at the Series D Conversion Price, and

(B)} the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common
Outstanding immediately after the issuance of such Additional Shares of
Common;

provided, however, that in no event shall the Series D Conversion Price be
reduced below $0.01.

4.6.4.4.5 Convertible Securities. For purposes of the adjustment required under
Section 4.6.4.4.4, Convertible Securities shall be treated as described in Section
4.3.4.4.5,

the Company for any issue or sale of securities shall be determined as set forth in
Section 4.3.4.4.6.

4.6.4.4.7 Liquidating Dividends. If the Company, at any time while any of the
Series D Preferred is outstanding, shall make a distribution of its assets to the
holders of its Common as a dividend in liquidation or partial liquidation or by way
of return of capital or other than as a dividend payable out of funds legally
available for dividends under the laws of the State of Delaware, the holders of the
Series D Preferred shall be entitled to receive, without payment of any
consideration therefor, the assets that would have been payable to them as owners
of that number of shares of Common receivable by exercise of such Series D
Conversion Rights, had they been the holders of record of such Common on the
record date for such distribution; and an appropriate provision therefor shall be
made a part of any such distribution in accordance with the preferential provisions
of Section 4.6.3 of this Restated Certificate.

Reservation of Shares. The Company will take such corporate action as may be

necessary from time to time so that at all times it will have authorized, and reserved out of its
authorized but unissued Common for the sole purpose of issuance upon conversion of shares of
4.6.5

fi# ZATIAR

-39-

Series D Preferred, a sufficient number of shares of Common to permit the conversion in full of
all outstanding shares of Series D Preferred.

4.6.4.6 Full Consideration. All shares of Common which shall be issued upon the
conversion of any Series D Preferred will, upon issuance, be fully paid and non-assessable.
The Company will pay such amounts and will take such other action as may be necessary from
time to time so that all shares of Common which shall be issued upon the exercise of the Series
D Conversion Right of any Series D Preferred will, upon issuance and without cost to the
recipient, be free from al] preemptive rights, taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issue
thereof.

4.6.4.7 Notice of Adjustment Events. Whenever the Company contemplates the
occurrence of an event which would give rise to adjustments under Section 4.6.4.4, the
Company shall mail to each holder of Series D Preferred, at least 20 days prior to the record

which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such event, and (iii) the date on which
such event is expected to become effective, and (iv) the time, if any is to be fixed, when the
holders of record of Common (or other securities) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of
Common (or other securities) for securities or other property deliverable in connection with
such event.

464.8 Notice of Adjustments. Whenever the Series D Conversion Price or the kind of
securities issuable upon the conversion of Series D Preferred, or both, shall be adjusted

such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company.

4.7.3.2 If, upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, whether
voluntary or involuntary, the assets to be distributed to the holders of Series D Preferred and

4.7.3.3 Upon the dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company, whether

of the Deemed Liquidation Events specified in Section 4.3.3.4 shall be treated as a liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Company and shall entitle the holders of shares of all series of
Preferred and Common to receive at the closing in cash, securities or other property (valued as
provided in Sections 4.3.3.5, 4.4.3.5, 4.5.3.5, 4.6.3.5 and 4.7.3.5) the amounts specified in

The "Series D-1 Conversion Price" shall initially be $4.298725 and shall be
subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in this Section 4.7.4.

4.7.4.1.2 Mandatory Conversion. All of the outstanding Series D-1 Preferred
shall, without any further action by a holder thereof, convert into Common (a
"Series D-1 Mandatory Conversion") upon the first to occur of the following
(each a “Series D-1 Mandatory Conversion Event’): (A) the Company's
Qualified Public Offering, (B) at such time as at least the Series D/D-1 Approval
Amount issued prior to such time have been voluntarily converted into Common by
the holders thereof, (C) at such time as is specified in a vote or written consent of
the holders of at least the Series D/D-1 Approval Amount, or (D) at such time as is
specified in a vote or written consent of the holders of at least the Series D/D-1
Approval Amount with respect to the conversion of all Preferred into Common. In
each case, each share of Series D-1 Preferred shall be automatically converted,
without cost, on the terms of this Section 4.7.4, into the number of shares of
Common into which such share of Series D-1 Preferred would be convertible under
4.7.4.1.1 immediately prior to such conversion.

Mechanics of Conversion.

4.7.4.2.1 Optional Conversion. A holder of any share of Series D-1 Preferred
may exercise the Series D-1 Conversion Right of such share by surrendering the
certificate therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Company or of any transfer
agent for the Series D-1 Preferred, together with a written notice to the Company
which states:

(A) that such holder elects to convert the same,
(B) the number of shares of Series D-1 Preferred being converted, and

{C) the name or names in which such holder wishes the certificate or
certificates for shares of Common to be issued.

Thereupon the Company shall promptly issue and deliver to the holder of such
shares, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates
for the number of shares of Common to which such holder shall be entitled. If
the certificate evidencing the shares of Series D-1 Preferred being converted shall
also evidence shares of Series D-1 Preferred not being converted, then the
Company shall also deliver to the holder of such certificate, or to the nominee or
nominees of such holder, a new stock certificate evidencing the Series D-]
Preferred not converted. Any dividends or distributions declared but unpaid at
the time of conversion with respect to a share of Series D-! Preferred so
converted shall be payable ratably to the holders of the Common issued upon
such conversion, pari passu with the payment of such dividends or distributions
payable pursuant to Section 4.6.4.2.1.

4.7.4.2.2 Mandatory Conversion. The Company shall give written notice to
each holder of a share of Series D-1 Preferred (A) not more than forty (40) nor less
than twenty (20) days before the anticipated effective date of the registration

Il# 347148

4.7.43

4.7.4.4

-45-

notice to each such holder upon the occurrence of any Qualified Public Offering;
and (B) upon the occurrence of any other Series D-1 Mandatory Conversion Event.
Following the conversion of such shares, each holder of shares so converted may
surrender the certificate therefor at the office of the Company or any transfer agent
for the Series D-1 Preferred. Upon such surrender, the Company shall issue and
deliver to each holder, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate
or certificates for the number of shares of Common to which such holder is
entitled. Any dividends or distributions declared but unpaid at the time of
conversion with respect to a share of Series D-1 Preferred so converted shall be
payable ratably to the holders of the Common issued upon such conversion, pari
passu with the payment of such dividends or distributions payable pursuant to
Section 4.6.4.2.2.

Effective Date of Conversion.

4.7.4.3.1 Optional Conversion. The conversion of any shares of Series D-1
Preferred shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of
business on the date that the shares to be converted are surrendered to the Company
together with the notice required by Section 4.7.4.2.1, and the person or persons
entitled to receive the shares of Common issuable upon such conversion shall be
treated for al] purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common
on such date.

4.74.3.2 Mandatory Conversion. The conversion of shares of Series D-|
Preferred shall take place upon the first to occur of the Series D-1 Mandatory
Conversion Events, whether or not the certificates representing such shares of
Series D-1 Preferred shall have been surrendered, or new certificates representing
the shares of Common into which such shares have been converted shall have been
issued.

Adjustment of Conversion Price.

4.7.4.4.1 Subdivision or Combination of Shares. If the Company at any time
subdivides or combines the outstanding Common after the Filing Date, the Series
D-1 Conversion Price shall be decreased, in the case of a subdivision, or increased,
in the case of a combination, in the same proportions as the Common is subdivided
or combined, effective automatically as of the date the Company shall take a record
of the holders of its Common for the purpose of the subdivision or combination (or
if no such record is taken, as of the effectiveness of the subdivision or
combination).

4.7.4.4.2 Stock Dividends. If the Company at any time pays a dividend, or
makes any other distribution, to holders of Common payable in shares of Common,
or fixes a record date for the determination of holders of Common entitled to
receive a dividend or other distribution payable in shares of Common, the Series D-
1 Conversion Price shall be decreased by multiplying it by a fraction:

(A) — the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common
outstanding immediately prior to such dividend or distribution, and
H# 347148

- 46 -

(B) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common
outstanding immediately after such dividend or distribution (plus, if the
Company paid cash instead of fractional shares otherwise issuable in such
dividend or distribution, the number of additional shares which would have been
outstanding had the Company issued fractional shares instead of cash),

effective automatically as of the date the Company shall take a record of the
holders of its Common for the purpose of receiving such dividend or distribution
(or if no such record is taken, as of the effectiveness of such dividend or
distribution).

4.7443 Reclassification, Consolidation or Merger. If at any time, as a result
of:

{A) a capital reorganization or reclassification (other than a subdivision,
combination or dividend which gives rise to adjustment of the Series D-1
Conversion Price pursuant to Sections 4.7.4.4.] or 4.7.4.4.2), or

(B) a merger or consolidation of the Company with another corporation
(whether or not the Company is the surviving corporation),

the Common issuable upon the conversion of the Series D-1 Preferred shall be
changed into or exchanged for the same or a different number of shares of any
class or classes of stock of the Company or any other corporation, or other
securities convertible into such shares, then, as a part of such reorganization,
reclassification, merger or consolidation, appropriate adjustments shall be made
in the terms of the Series D-] Preferred (or of any securities into which the Series
D-1 Preferred is changed or for which the Series D-1 Preferred is exchanged), so
that:

(X) the holders of Series D-1 Preferred or of such substitute securities shall
thereafter be entitled to receive, upon conversion of the Series D-1 Preferred or
of such substitute securities, the kind and amount of shares of stock, other
securities, money and property which such holders would have received at the
time of such capital reorganization, reclassification, merger, or consolidation, if
such holders had converted their Series D-] Preferred into Common immediately
prior to such capital reorganization, reclassification, merger, or consolidation,
and

(Y) the Series D-1 Preferred or such substitute securities shall thereafter be
adjusted on terms as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments
theretofore provided this Section 4.7.4.4.

The provisions of this Section 4.7.4.4.3 shall similarly apply to successive capital
reorganizations, reclassifications, mergers, and consolidations.

4.7.4.4.4 Additional Shares of Common.

(a) If at any time after the Filing Date until the Dilution Lapse Date, the
Company issues (or is deemed by the express provisions of Section 4.3.4.4.5
H# 347148

-47-

to have issued or sold) Additional Shares of Common without consideration
or for a consideration per share less than the Series D-1 Conversion Price in
effect at such issuance, then the Series D-1 Conversion Price shall be
reduced, concurrently with such issuance, to a price equal to the
consideration per share of such Additional Shares of Common; provided,
however, that in no event shall the Series D-1 Conversion Price be reduced
below $0.01.

(b) If at any time after the Dilution Lapse Date, the Company issues (or is
deemed by the express provisions of Section 4.3.4.4.5 to have issued or sold)
Additional Shares of Common without consideration or for a consideration
per share less than the Series D-] Conversion Price in effect at such issuance,
then the Series D-1 Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently with
such issuance, to a price (calculated to the nearest cent) equal to the price
determined by multiplying the Series D-1 Conversion Price by a fraction:

(A) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common
Outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Shares of
Common plus the number of shares of Common which the aggregate
consideration received (or by the express provisions hereof deemed to have been
received) by the Company for the total number of such Additional Shares of
Common so issued would purchase at the Series D-1 Conversion Price, and

(B) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common
Outstanding immediately after the issuance of such Additional Shares of
Common;

provided, however, that in no event shall the Series D-] Conversion Price be
reduced below $0.01.

4.744.5 Convertible Securities. For purposes of the adjustment required under
Section 4.7.4.4.4, Convertible Securities shall be treated as described in Section
4.3.4.4.5.

4.7446 Valuation of Consideration. The value of consideration received by
the Company for any issue or sale of securities shall be determined as set forth in
Section 4.3.4.4.6.

4.7.4.4.7  Liquidating Dividends. If the Company, at any time while any of the
Series D-1 Preferred is outstanding, shall make a distribution of its assets to the
holders of its Common as a dividend in liquidation or partial liquidation or by way
of return of capital or other than as a dividend payable out of funds legaily
available for dividends under the laws of the State of Delaware, the holders of the
Series D-1 Preferred shall be entitled to receive, without payment of any
consideration therefor, the assets that would have been payable to them as owners
of that number of shares of Common receivable by exercise of such Series D-]
Conversion Rights, had they been the holders of record of such Common on the
record date for such distribution; and an appropriate provision therefor shall be
made a part of any such distribution in accordance with the preferential provisions
of Section 4.7.3 of this Restated Certificate.

4.7.4.5 Reservation of Shares. The Company wil] take such corporate action as may be
necessary from time to time so that at all times it will have authorized, and reserved out of its
authorized but unissued Common for the sole purpose of issuance upon conversion of shares of
Series D-1 Preferred, a sufficient number of shares of Common to permit the conversion in full
of all outstanding shares of Series D-1 Preferred.

4.7.4.6 Full Consideration. All shares of Common which shall be issued upon the
conversion of any Series D-1 Preferred will, upon issuance, be fully paid and non-assessable.
The Company will pay such amounts and will take such other action as may be necessary from
time to time so that all shares of Common which shall be issued upon the exercise of the Series
D-1 Conversion Right of any Series D-1 Preferred will, upon issuance and without cost to the
recipient, be free from all preemptive rights, taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issue
thereof.

4.7.4.7 Notice _of Adjustment Events. Whenever the Company contemplates the
occurrence of an event which would give rise to adjustments under Section 4.7.4.4, the

such event, a notice specifying (i) the nature of the contemplated event, and (ii) the date on
which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such event, and (iii) the date on which
such event is expected to become effective, and (iv) the time, if any is to be fixed, when the
holders of record of Common (or other securities) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of
Common (or other securities) for securities or other property deliverable in connection with
such event.

4.7.4.8 Notice of Adjustments. Whenever the Series D-1 Conversion Price or the kind of
securities issuable upon the conversion of Series D-1 Preferred, or both, shall be adjusted
pursuant to Section 4.7.4.4, the Company shail mail to each holder of Series D-1 Preferred, by
first class mail postage prepaid, promptly after each adjustment, a certificate signed by its
President or a Vice President and by its Chief Financial Officer, Secretary or Assistant
Secretary, setting forth, in reasonable detail, the event requiring the adjustment, the amount of
the adjustment, the method by which such adjustment was calculated (including a description
of the basis on which the Board of Directors made any determination hereunder), and the Series
D-1t Conversion Price and the kind of securities issuable upon the conversion of Series D-1
Preferred after giving effect to such adjustment.

the Company by reason of redemption, purchase, conversion or otherwise shall be reissued, and

the holders of at least the Series D/D-] Approval Amount, such action shall be null and void ab
initio, and of no force or effect.

Pay to Play Conversion. Each share of Preferred is subject to the following provisions:

If a Purchaser (as such term is defined in the Series D-1 Purchase Agreement) does not
purchase at the Closing (as such term is defined in the Series D-1 Purchase Agreement) shares
of Series D-1 Preferred for a dollar amount at least equal to the amount set forth opposite such
Purchaser’s name on Exhibit A-2 to the Series D-1 Purchase Agreement, each share of
Preferred held by such Purchaser shall automatically convert into the number of shares of
Common into which such share of Preferred would be convertible under Section 4.3.4.1.1,
4.4.4.1.1, 4.5.4.1.1 or 4.6.4.1.1, as applicable, immediately prior to such conversion.

Promptly following the Closing, the holder of shares so converted shall surrender the
certificates therefor at the office of the Company or any transfer agent for the Preferred. Upon
such surrender the Company shall issue and deliver to such holder, or to the nominee or
nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common to
which such holder is entitled. If a holder’s shares of Preferred are converted pursuant to this
Section 4.8, then notwithstanding that the certificates evidencing such shares shall not have
been surrendered, all rights with respect to such shares shall terminate at the Closing, except
only the right of the holder upon surrender of the certificates evidencing such converted shares
to receive certificates evidencing the shares of Common issued upon such conversion.

Ail shares of Common issued to any holder of Preferred as a result of conversion pursuant to
this Section 4.8 shall be aggregated for the purpose of determining the number of shares of
Common to which such holder shall be entitled, and no fractional shares shall be issued in
connection with such conversion. No cash in lieu of any fractional share shall be paid to any
stockholder as a result of conversion pursuant to this Section 4.8. In determining whether a
Purchaser has satisfied the criteria set forth in Section 4.8.1, any purchases of Series D-|!
Preferred under the Series D-1 Purchase Agreement by a Related Party (as defined in the Series
D-1 Purchase Agreement) of such Purchaser that are in excess of such Related Party’s
obligations under the Series D-1 Purchase Agreement, if any, shall, to the extent requested by
such Related Party be attributed to such Purchaser; provided that no shares constituting part of
such excess shall be attributed to more than one person or entity.
