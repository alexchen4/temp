The grant of an option, whether a nonqualified or nonstatutory stock option (“NSO”) or
an incentive stock option (“ISO”), 1s not a taxable event for the optionee, and the Company
obtains no deduction for the grant of the option Note, however, that options granted at a
discount from fair market value may be considered “deferred compensation” subject to new tax
law requirements generally effective January 1, 2005 The new tax law imposes penalties on
taxpayers with respect to deferred compensation arrangements that do not comply with the new
requirements

Nonqualified or Nonstatutory Stock Options

The exercise of an NSO 1s a taxable event to the optionee The amount by which the fair
market value of the shares on the date of exercise exceeds the exercise price (the “spread”) will
be taxed to the optionee as ordinary income The spread will also be considered “wages” for
purposes of FICA taxes The Company will be entitled to a deduction in the same amount as the
ordinary income recognized by the optionee from the exercise of the option that 1s reported to the
IRS by the optionee or the Company In general, the optionee’s tax basis in the shares acquired
by exercising an NSO 1s equal to the fair market value of such shares on the date of exercise
Upon a subsequent sale of any such shares in a taxable transaction, the optionee will realize
capital gain or loss (long-term or short-term, depending on whether the shares were held for the
required holding period before the sale) in an amount equal to the difference between his or her
basis in the shares and the sale price

The capital gains holding periods are complex If shares are held for more than one year,
the maximum tax rate on the gain is currently fifteen percent (15%) for gain recognized on or
after May 6, 2003, and before January 1, 2009 Because the rules are complex and can vary in
individual circumstances, each participant should consider consulting his or her own tax advisor

If an optionee exercises an NSO and pays the exercise price with previously acquired
shares of stock, special rules apply The transaction 1s treated as a tax-free exchange of the old
shares for the same number of new shares, except as described below with respect to shares
acquired pursuant to [SOs The opttonee’s basis in the new shares 1s the same as his or her basis
in the old shares, and the capital gains holding period runs without interruption from the date
when the old shares were acquired The value of any new shares received by the optionee in
excess of the number of old shares surrendered minus any cash the optionee pays for the new
shares will be taxed as ordinary income The optionee’s basis in the additional shares 1s equal to
the fair market value of such shares on the date the shares were transferred, and the capital gain
holding period commences on the same date The effect of these rules 1s to defer recognition of
any gain in the old shares when those shares are used to buy new shares Stated differently, these
rules allow an optionee to finance the exercise of an NSO by using shares of stock that he or she
already owns, without paying current tax on any unrealized appreciation in those old shares

Incentive Stock Options

The holder of an ISO will not be subject to U S federal income tax upon the exercise of
the ISO, and the Company will not be entitled to a tax deduction by reason of such exercise,
provided that the holder 1s employed by the Company on the exercise date (or the holder’s
employment terminated within the three (3) months preceding the exercise date) Exceptions to
this exercise timing requirement apply in the event the optionee dies or becomes disabled A
subsequent sale of the shares received upon the exercise of an ISO will result in the realization of
long-term capital gain or loss in the amount of the difference between the amount realized on the
sale and the exercise price for such shares, provided that the sale occurs more than one (1) year
after the exercise of the ISO and more than two (2) years after the grant of the ISO In general, if
a sale or disposition of the shares occurs prior to satisfaction of the foregoing holding periods
(referred to as a “disqualifying disposition”), the optionee will recognize ordinary income and
the Company will be entitled to a corresponding deduction, generally equal to the amount of
ordinary income recognized by the optionee from the disqualifying disposition that 1s reported to
the IRS by the optionee or the Company

Favorable tax treatment 1s accorded to an optionee only to the extent that the value of the
shares (determined at the time of grant) covered by an ISO first exercisable in any single
calendar year does not exceed one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) If ISOs for shares
whose aggregate value exceeds one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) become exercisable in
the same calendar year, the excess will be treated as NSOs

A special rule applies if an optionee pays all or part of the exercise price of an ISO by
surrendering shares of stock that he or she previously acquired by exercising any other ISO_ If
the optionee has not held the old shares for the full duration of the applicable holding periods,
then the surrender of such shares to fund the exercise of the new ISO will be treated as a
disqualifying disposition of the old shares As described above, the result of a disqualifying
disposition 1s the loss of favorable tax treatment with respect to the acquisition of the old shares
pursuant to the previously exercised ISO

60412683v1
Where the applicable holding period requirements have been met, the use of previously
acquired shares of stock to pay all or a portion of the exercise price of an ISO may offer
significant tax advantages In particular, a deferral of the recognition of any appreciation in the
surrendered shares 1s available in the same manner as discussed above with respect to NSOs

Alternative Minimum Tax

Alternative minimum tax 1s paid when such tax exceeds a taxpayer’s regular U S_ federal
income tax Alternatrve minimum tax 1s calculated based on alternative minimum taxable
income, which ts taxable income for U S federal income tax purposes, modified by certain
adjustments and increased by tax preference items

The “spread” under an [SO—that 1s, the difference between (a) the fair market value of
the shares of stock at exercise and (b) the exercise price—is classified as alternative minimum
taxable income for the year of exercise Alternative minimum taxable income may be subject to
the alternative minimum tax However, a disqualifying disposition of the shares of stock subject
to the ISO during the same year in which the ISO was exercised will generally negate the
alternatrve minimum taxable income generated upon exercise of the ISO

In general, when a taxpayer sells stock acquired through the exercise of an ISO, only the
difference between the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise and the date of sale
1s used in computing any alternative minimum tax for the year of the sale The portion of a
taxpayer’s alternative minimum tax attributable to certain items of tax preference (including the
spread upon the exercise of an ISO) can be credited against the taxpayer’s regular liability in
later years to the extent that liability exceeds the alternative minimum tax

Withholding Taxes

Exercise of an NSO produces taxable income which ts subject to withholding The
Company will not deliver shares to the optionee unless the optionee has agreed to satisfactory
arrangements for meeting all applicable U S_ federal, state and local withholding tax
requirements

US federal tax law does not require unrecognized gain on exercise of an ISO to be
treated as “wages” for the purposes of FICA taxes

Early Exercise

If an optionee 1s permitted to exercise an option before the optionee’s rights 1n the shares
subject to the option are vested, the tax aspects of such an “early exercise” will be as follows

ALTIERRE CORPORATION
Exuistt F To STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT
U S FEDERAL TAX INFORMATION

F-3

60412683v1
Incentive Stock Options

When an ISO 1s exercised, the spread 1s a “preference” item in the year of
exercise, which 1s taken into account in computing an optionee’s alternative minimum
tax One technique which might enable an optionee to minimize the amount recognized
as alternative minimum tax income ts to exercise the option at or near the date of grant
when the spread 1s nonexistent or small If the option ts not vested, the optionee would
also make an election under Section 83(b) of the Code (“Section 83(b) Election”) within
thirty (30) days after the date of exercise In this way the optionee will pay alternative
minimum tax based on the spread on the date of exercise instead of the spread on the date
the shares vest The exercise of the option also begins the one-year holding requirement
under Section 422 of the Code that applies after the exercise of an ISO

However, according to US Treasury Regulations issued in August, 2004, an
83(b) Election will not be effective for purposes of measuring the amount of ordinary
income 1n the event of a disqualifying disposition of the ISO Shares, and ordinary income
will be recognized in an amount equal to the spread on the date the shares vest, instead of
the spread on the date the ISO 1s exercised For this reason, an optionee ts urged to
consult with a tax advisor before electing to exercise an ISO for unvested shares

Nonstatutory Stock Options

If the option 1s not an ISO but instead ts an NSO, exercise prior to vesting and
timely filing of a Section 83(b) Election will accomplish two things (1) it will start the
capital gains holding period running, and (2) it will prevent the optionee from being taxed
(at ordmary come tax rates) upon vesting, 1f, at that time, the fair market value of the
stock has increased from the date of grant Ofcourse, when the shares are sold, the gain
will be taxed according to how long the shares have been held

Forfeiture of Unvested Shares

If service with the Company terminates before the shares are vested, the Company
may repurchase the shares at the original purchase price of the shares If you had made a
Section 83(b) Election, you will not be entitled to deduct as a loss any income recognized
on exercise of the option if the fair market value of the stock had exceeded the exercise
price at that time

THIS TAX SUMMARY IS GENERAL IN NATURE AND SHOULD NOT BE RELIED
UPON BY ANY PERSON IN DECIDING WHETHER OR WHEN TO EXERCISE AN
OPTION OR TO MAKE AN ELECTION UNDER SECTION 83(b) OF THE CODE
EACH PERSON SHOULD CONSULT HIS OR HER OWN TAX ADVISOR
