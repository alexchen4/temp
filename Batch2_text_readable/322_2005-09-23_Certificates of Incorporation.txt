issue is twenty-one million two hundred sixteen thousand seven hundred eight (21,216,708)
shares, consisting of:

(i) fourteen million (14,000,000) shares of common stock, par value

(7,216,708) shares of preferred stock, par value $0.005 per share (“Preferred Stock”), all of
which shares are designated as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred
Stock”),

B. Terms of Preferred Stock.
1. Series A Preferred Stock.

The preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights of Series A
Preferred Stock, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, are as follows:

(i) Dividends.

The holders of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to receive any
fixed dividends thereon. Cash or other types of dividends (other than fixed dividends) may be
declared and paid upon the Series A Preferred Stock in such amounts and at such times as the
Board of Directors may determine whether or not any dividends are declared and paid upon the
Common Stock.

50487227.9
(ii) | Redemption.

(a) Right to Require Redemption. Shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be redeemed
by the Corporation within 60 days after delivery of written notice from the holders of at least 66
2/3% of the then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock (the “Supermajority Holders”)
requesting redemption of all or any portion of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock at any time on
or after the fifth (5") anniversary of the Original Issue Date

(b) Redemption Price. The redemption price (the “Redemption Price”) for any shares of
Series A Preferred Stock redeemed under this Section B.1(ii) shall be equal to the greater of: (i)
$0.415702 (the “Original Issue Price”) per share (as adjusted for any stock dividends,
combinations, reverse stock splits, splits, recapitalizations, reorganizations, reclassifications or
other similar event with respect to shares) plus all declared but un-paid dividends thereon and (ii)
the Fair Market Value of such shares on an As-If-Converted Basis as hereinafter defined, at the
time of such redemption. “Fair Market Value” shall mean the fair market value as agreed upon by
a majority of the disinterested directors of the Corporation and the Supermajority Holders and in
the event that the Corporation and the Supermajority Holders do not agree upon the fair market
value, then the Fair Market Value shall be as determined by an independent third party appraiser
without taking into consideration any discount for minority positions.

(c) Procedure for Redemption.

(i) Any notice by the Super Majority Holders of their election that shares be
redeemed which is to be delivered to the Corporation pursuant to clause B.1.(ii)(a) shall be
delivered to the Corporation at its principal place of business at the time, to the attention of
the President, by (A) first class certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, (B) nationally
recognized overnight courier service, or (C) personal delivery.

(ii) | Onor prior to any redemption date, each holder of Series A Preferred Stock
which has shares which are to be redeemed on such redemption date shall surrender her, his
or its certificates representing the shares to be redeemed on such redemption date to the
Corporation, in the manner and at the place designated by the Corporation, acting
reasonably, and against such surrender the Redemption Price of such shares shall be paid on
the redemption date to the order of the person whose name appears on each such certificate
as the owner thereof. Each surrendered certificate shall be canceled and retired. If fewer
than all the shares represented by any such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall
be issued representing the unredeemed shares.

(iii) If the funds of the Corporation legally available for redemption of the Series
A Preferred Stock on a redemption date are insufficient to redeem the full number of shares
of Series A Preferred Stock required by these Articles of Incorporation to be redeemed on
such date, those funds which are legally available shall be used to redeem the maximum
possible number of shares of such Series A Preferred Stock, ratably among the holders of
the Series A Preferred Stock based upon the number of such shares of Series A Preferred
Stock that each such holder thereof is entitled to have redeemed on such redemption date.
At any time thereafter when additional funds of the Corporation become legally available
for the redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock, such funds will be used promptly to

50487227.9
redeem the balance of the Series A Preferred Stock which the Corporation was theretofore
obligated to redeem, ratably on the basis set forth in the preceding sentence.

(iv) | The date on which the redemption of any Series A Preferred Stock is to
occur may be delayed if an independent third-party appraisal is required to determine the
Redemption Price. In such case, said redemption shall occur within thirty (30) days of the
determination of Fair Market Value by the independent third-party appraiser.

(iii) Liquidation Rights.

(a) In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation or
other distribution of assets of the Corporation among its shareholders for the purpose of winding-
up the Corporation’s affairs, whether voluntary or involuntary (each a “Dissolution Event’), each
holder of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, prior and in
preference to any distribution of any of the assets or surplus funds of the Corporation to the
holders of the Common Stock or any other security ranking junior to the Series A Preferred
Stock as to liquidation, distributions in cash, securities or other property (valued as provided in
paragraph (d) of this Section B.1(iii)) equal to the Original Issue Price then held by such holder
(as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, reverse stock splits, splits, recapitalizations,
reorganizations, reclassifications or other similar event with respect to shares), plus all declared,
but un-paid dividends thereon. If upon the occurrence of a Dissolution Event, the assets and
funds legally available for distribution among the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall
be insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full aforesaid preferential amount,
then the entire assets and funds of the Corporation legally available for distribution shall be
distributed ratably among the holders of Series A Preferred Stock in proportion to the full
preferential amount each such holder is otherwise entitled to receive.

(b) For purposes of this Article Fourth of the Articles of Incorporation, unless
otherwise determined by the Supermajority Holders, each of the following (each a “Fundamental
Change”) as well as a sale to a Purchaser (as herein defined) conducted in accordance with
paragraph (e) of this Section B.1(iii), shall be treated as a Dissolution Event and shall entitle the
holders of Series A Preferred Stock (other than in the event of a sale conducted in accordance
with paragraphs (e), (f) and (g) of this Section B.1(iii)) to receive at the closing from the
Corporation, purchaser, surviving or acquiring entity or the transferee in cash, securities or other
property (valued as provided in paragraph (d) of this Section B.1(iii)) the greater of the amounts
as specified in paragraphs (a) and (c) of this Section B.1(iii) or the amount paid to the
Corporation, on a pro rata basis, or to the shareholders of the Corporation, as applicable, upon
the occurrence of such Fundamental Change: (1) the closing of the sale, transfer or other
disposition of all or substantially all of the Corporation’s assets (including, but not limited to, the
licensing of all or substantially all of the intellectual property assets of the Corporation to one or
more third parties), (2) the consummation of the merger or consolidation of the Corporation with
or into another entity (except a merger or consolidation in which the holders of capital stock of
the Corporation immediately prior to such merger or consolidation continue to hold at least 50%
of the voting power of the capital stock of the Corporation or the surviving or acquiring entity),
or (3) the closing of the transfer (whether by financing, merger, consolidation or otherwise), in
one transaction or a series of related transactions, to a person or group of affiliated persons (other
than an underwriter of the Corporation’s securities), of the Corporation’s securities if, after such
closing and as a result of such transaction(s), the Corporation’s stockholders before such event
would own as a result of their ownership of the Corporation’s securities before such event fifty

50487227.9

percent (50%) or less of the Corporation’s voting securities after such event; provided, however,
that a transaction shall not constitute a Fundamental Change if its sole purpose is to change the
state of the Corporation’s incorporation or to create a holding company that will be owned in
substantially the same proportions by the persons who held the Corporation’s securities
immediately prior to such transaction. Notwithstanding the prior sentence, the sale of shares of
Series A Preferred Stock in a financing transaction shall not be deemed a “Fundamental
Change”. Notwithstanding anything in this Section B.1(iii)(b) to the contrary, in the event a
Fundamental Change is followed by any Dissolution Event (other than a Fundamental Change
treated as a Dissolution Event), the distributions to the Series A Preferred Stock shall be
determined under Sections B.1(iii)(a) and (c) and not under this Section B.1(ili)(b). The
treatment of any particular transaction or series of related transactions as a Fundamental Change
may be waived by the vote or written consent of the holders of at least a majority of the
outstanding Series A Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class and not as separate series,
and on an As-If-Converted Basis).

(c) In the event of a Dissolution Event, other than a Fundamental Change treated as a
Dissolution Event under Section B.1(iii)(b) above, then after the payment to the holders of shares
of the Series A Preferred Stock of the full preferential amounts provided for in paragraph (a) of
this Section B.1(iii), the remaining assets and funds of the Corporation, if any, shall be
distributed among the holders of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Common Stock, pro
rata based on the number of shares of Common Stock held or deemed held by each such holder,
treating for this purpose all such securities as if they had been converted to Common Stock
pursuant to the terms of the Articles of Incorporation immediately prior to such Dissolution
Event.

(d) | Whenever the distribution provided for in this Section B.1(iii) shall be payable in
securities or property other than cash, the value of such distribution shall be the Fair Market
Value of such securities or other property.

(e) Subject to paragraph (g) of this Section B.1(iii), if:

(a) shareholders (the “Accepting Shareholders”) holding not less than 66-
2/3% of the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock have agreed to Transfer
(as defined in Section B.1(v)) to a Person (as defined in Section B.1(v)) or
Persons acting in concert (a “Purchaser”), all of their shares of Series A
Preferred Stock and Common Stock; and

(b) the Purchaser offers to each of the other shareholders (the “Forced
Shareholders”) to purchase the remaining securities of the Corporation
(the “Specified Securities”) on equivalent terms and conditions, mutatis
mutandis, as those agreed to by the Accepting Shareholders, all of which
terms and conditions are set out in writing and promptly delivered to the
Forced Shareholders (the “Drag-Along Offer”),

the Forced Shareholders shall be required to sell all of their Specified Securities to the Purchaser
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Drag Along Offer.

(f) Upon acceptance of a Drag Along Offer the Accepting Shareholders shall

forthwith provide notice in writing (the “Drag Along Notice”) to the holders of Equity Securities
(as defined in Section B.1(v)) which are subject to the Drag Along Offer which (the “Other

50487227.9
Securityholders”) specifies the name of the Purchaser, the purchase prices, the intended closing
date and place and all other material terms and conditions of the intended sale.

(g) | Securityholders of the Corporation shall not accept an offer from a Purchaser
unless the offer is an arm’s length bonafide offer and is structured to comply with the pricing that
would be established at that time under paragraph (b) of this Section B.1(iii).

(iv) Conversion.
The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as follows:

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be convertible, in
whole or in part, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such
share at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for such stock, into such number of
fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate, determined
as hereinafter provided, in effect on the date the certificate is surrendered for conversion in
accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section B.1(iv). The Conversion Rate at which shares of
Common Stock shall be deliverable upon conversion of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock
shall initially be one. Such initial Conversion Rate shall be adjusted as hereinafter provided.

(b) | Automatic Conversion. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall
automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the then-effective Conversion Rate
and such shares may not be reissued by the Corporation as shares of such series upon the earlier
of (A) the closing of the sale of the Corporation’s Common Stock in a firm commitment,
underwritten public offering registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
“Securities Act”), other than a registration relating solely to a transaction under Rule 145 under
the Securities Act (or any successor thereto), at a public offering price (prior to underwriters’
discounts and expenses) equal to or exceeding $1.662808 (as adjusted for any stock dividends,
combinations, reverse stock splits, splits, recapitalizations, reorganizations, reclassifications or
other similar event with respect to shares), and in which the aggregate proceeds to the
Corporation and/or any selling shareholders (prior to underwriters’ discounts and expenses) are
at least $25,000,000 (a “Qualified Public Offering”) or (B) on the date on which more than
4,510,438 shares (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, reverse stock splits, splits,
recapitalizations, reorganizations, reclassifications or other similar event with respect to shares)
of the Series A Preferred Stock are converted into shares of Common Stock (the “Mandatory
Conversion Date”).

(c) Mechanics of Conversion.

(1) Before any holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert
any of such shares into shares of Common Stock pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section
B.1(iv), such holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates evidencing such shares, duly
endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for such stock, and shall give
written notice to the Corporation at such office of the number of shares that such holder elects to
so convert. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter (but in any event within 20
business days thereafter), issue and deliver to such holder of Series A Preferred Stock a
certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall
be entitled as aforesaid and, if applicable, a certificate or certificates representing any such shares
of Series A Preferred Stock that are not being so converted (but were otherwise represented by a
certificate that included shares that were being so converted). Any such conversion shall be

50487227.9
deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of surrender of
the certificate or certificates for the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be converted, and the
person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion
shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock
on such date.

(II) In the event of an automatic conversion pursuant to paragraph (b)(A) of
this Section B.1(iv), the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering shares of Series A
Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale
of securities pursuant to such offering, in which event the person(s) entitled to receive the
Common Stock upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have
converted such Series A Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of
securities. No holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall receive certificates for shares of
Common Stock upon such conversion unless and until such holder shall surrender the certificate
or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for
such stock. Until surrendered as provided above, each certificate previously representing shares
of Series A Preferred Stock shall be deemed for all corporate purposes to represent the number of
shares of Common Stock resulting from such automatic conversion.

(d) | Adjustments to Conversion Rate for Certain Diluting Issues.

(1) Special Definitions. For purposes of paragraph (d) of this Section B.1(iv)
and for purposes of paragraph (b) of Section B.1(v), the following definitions apply:

(1) “Options” shall mean options, warrants and rights entitling the
holders thereof to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire Common Stock, Preferred Stock
or Convertible Securities.

(2) “Original Issue Date” shall mean the first date on which a share of
Series A Preferred Stock is first issued by the Corporation.

(3) “Convertible Securities” shall mean any _ evidences of
indebtedness, shares (other than Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock) or other securities
convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock.

(4) “Additional Shares of Common Stock” shall mean all shares of
Common Stock issued (or, pursuant to subparagraph (d)(II]) of this Section B.1(iv), deemed to
be issued) by the Corporation after the Original Issue Date, other than shares of Common Stock
issued or issuable in any of the following transactions:

(A) upon conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock;

(B) to officers, directors or employees of, or consultants or
advisers to, the Corporation pursuant to stock option or stock purchase plans, employment
agreements, consulting agreements, warrants or agreements on terms from time to time approved
by the Corporation’s Board of Directors (the “Board of Directors”), up to a maximum of
2,500,000 shares of Common Stock unless a greater amount is approved by a majority in interest
of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock (including, without limitation, shares of Common
Stock issued or issuable pursuant to stock options or warrants assumed in connection with
acquisitions described in clause (E) below);

50487227.9
(C) to financial institutions or lessors pursuant to commercial
credit arrangements, equipment financings, leasing transactions or similar transaction, each of
which are approved by the Corporation’s Board of Directors, and which in the aggregate do not
exceed 1% of the fully diluted number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Original Issue Date;

(D) _ in connection with bona fide business acquisitions or other
strategic transactions, each of which are approved by the Corporation’s Board of Directors, and
which in the aggregate do not exceed 5% of the fully diluted number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Original Issue Date, unless a greater amount is approved by
a majority in interest of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock;

(E) _ upon the exercise of any Options issued and outstanding as
of the Original Issue Date;

(F) as a dividend or distribution on shares of the Series A
Preferred Stock; and

(G) for which adjustment of the Conversion Rate is made
pursuant to paragraph (e) or paragraph (f) of this Section B.1(iv).

(II) No Adjustment of Conversion Rate. Any provision of these Articles of
Incorporation to the contrary notwithstanding, no adjustment in the Conversion Rate shall be
made in respect of the issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock or deemed issue of
Additional Shares of Common Stock unless the consideration per share (determined pursuant to
subparagraph (d)(V) of this Section B.1(iv)) for an Additional Share of Common Stock issued or
deemed to be issued by the Corporation is less than the Original Issue Price (as adjusted for any
stock dividends, combinations, reverse stock splits, splits, recapitalizations, reorganizations,
reclassifications or other similar event with respect to shares).

(II) Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock. Except as otherwise
excluded under Section B.1(iv)(d)()(4), in the event the Corporation at any time or from time to
time after the Original Issue Date shall issue any Options or Convertible Securities or shall fix a
record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities then entitled to receive any
such Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of shares (as set forth in the
instrument relating thereto without regard to any provisions contained therein designed to protect
against dilution) of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case of
Convertible Securities and Options for Convertible Securities, the conversion or exchange of
such Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to be Additional Shares of Common Stock issued
as of the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of
business on such record date, provided that in any such case in which Additional Shares of
Common Stock are deemed to be issued:

(1) no further adjustments in the Conversion Rate shall be made upon
the subsequent issue of such Convertible Securities where an adjustment to the Conversion Rate
had been made on the record date, or shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of such Options
or conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, in each case where an adjustment to
the Conversion Rate had been made on the record date or issue date;

50487227.9

(2) if such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms provide,
with the passage of time or otherwise, for any increase or decrease in the consideration payable
to the Corporation, or decrease or increase in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable,
upon the exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, the Conversion Rate computed upon the
original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and any
subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon any such increase or decrease becoming
effective, be recomputed to reflect such increase or decrease insofar as it affects such Options or
the rights of conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities (provided, however, that
no such adjustment of the Conversion Rate shall affect Common Stock previously issued upon
conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock);

(3) upon the expiration of any such Options or any rights of
conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have been exercised,
the Conversion Rate computed upon the original issuance thereof (or upon the occurrence of a
record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon
such expiration, be recomputed as if:

(A) in the case of Options or Convertible Securities for
Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common Stock issued were the shares of
Common Stock, if any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities and the consideration received therefor was the
consideration actually received by the Corporation for the issue of all such Options, whether or
not exercised, plus the consideration actually received by the Corporation upon such exercise or
for the issue of all such Convertible Securities which were actually converted or exchanged, plus
the additional consideration, if any, actually received by the Corporation upon such conversion
or exchange, and

(B) _ in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, only the
Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were issued at the time of
issue of such Options, and the consideration received by the Corporation for the Additional
Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been then issued was the consideration actually
received by the Corporation for the issue of all such Options, whether or not exercised, plus the
consideration deemed to have been received by the Corporation (determined pursuant to
subparagraph (d)(V) of this Section B.1(iv)) upon the issue of the Convertible Securities with
respect to which such Options were actually exercised;

(4) no readjustment pursuant to clause (2) or (3) above shall have the
effect of increasing the Conversion Rate to an amount which exceeds the lower of (a) the
Conversion Rate on the original adjustment date, or (b) the Conversion Rate that would have
resulted from any issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock, other than those Additional
Shares of Common Stock causing such readjustment, between the original adjustment date and
such readjustment date;

(5) in the case of any Options which expire by their terms not more
than 30 days after the date of issue thereof, no adjustment of the Conversion Rate shall be made
until the expiration or exercise of all such Options, whereupon such adjustment shall be made in
the same manner provided in clause (3) above; and

(6) in the event that any adjustment described in this subparagraph
(d)(III) is made, with respect to any Additional Shares of Common Stock that were originally

50487227.9
issued (or deemed issued) for a consideration per share equal to or in excess of the Original Issue
Price (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, reverse stock splits, splits,
recapitalizations, reorganizations, reclassifications or other similar event with respect to shares)
that, had such adjustment been made prior to such original issue date (or deemed original issue
date) would have caused such Additional Shares of Common Stock to be issued for a
consideration per share less than the Original Issue Price (as adjusted for any stock dividends,
combinations, reverse stock splits, splits, recapitalizations, reorganizations, reclassifications or
other similar event with respect to shares) then in effect, then such Additional Shares of
Common Stock shall be deemed to have been issued as of the date of any such adjustment.

(IV) Adjustment of Conversion Rate Upon Issuance of Additional Shares of
Common Stock. In the event the Corporation, at any time after the Original Issue Date, shall
issue Additional Shares of Common Stock (including Additional Shares of Common Stock
deemed to be issued pursuant to subparagraph (d)(II) of this Section B.1(iv)) without
consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Original Issue Price (as adjusted for
any stock dividends, combinations, reverse stock splits, splits, recapitalizations, reorganizations,
reclassifications or other similar event with respect to shares), then and in such event, the
Conversion Rate shall be increased, concurrently with such issue, in accordance with the
following formula:

CR = (A * (B+D))/(A*B + C*D)
For purposes of the foregoing formula, the following definitions shall apply:

(1) — CR shall mean the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after
such issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock;

(2) “A” shall mean the Original Issue Price per share (as adjusted for
any stock dividends, combinations, reverse stock splits, splits, recapitalizations, reorganizations,
reclassifications or other similar event with respect to shares);

(3)  “B” shall mean the fully-diluted number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue;

(4) “C” shall mean the consideration per share to be paid for the
Additional Shares of Common Stock issued in such transaction; and

(5) “TD” shall mean the number of such Additional Shares of Common
Stock issued in such transaction.

(V) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of paragraph (d) of this
Section B.1(iv), the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional
Shares of Common Stock shall be computed as follows:
(1) Cash and Property. Such consideration shall:

(A) _ insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the aggregate
amount of cash received by the Corporation excluding amounts paid or payable for accrued
interest or accrued dividends;

50487227.9
(B) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair value thereof at the time of such issue; and

(C) in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock are issued
together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for consideration which
covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in
clauses (A) and (B) above.

(2) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per share
received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been
issued pursuant to subparagraph (d)(II) of this Section B.1(iv), relating to Options and
Convertible Securities shall be determined by dividing:

(A) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the
Corporation as consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the
minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating
thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein designed to protect against dilution)
payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of
such Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of
such Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities by

(B) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set
forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein
designed to protect against dilution) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities.

(e) | Adjustments to Conversion Rates for Stock Dividends and for Combinations or
Subdivisions of Common Stock. In the event that the Corporation at any time or from time to
time after the Original Issue Date shall declare or pay, without consideration, any dividend on
the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock or in any right to acquire shares of
Common Stock for no consideration, or shall effect a subdivision of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock into a greater number of shares of Common Stock (by stock split, reclassification
or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock or in any right to acquire
shares of Common Stock), or in the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be
combined or consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of
Common Stock, then the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to such event shall,
concurrently with the effectiveness of such event, be proportionately decreased or increased, as
appropriate. In the event that the Corporation shall declare or pay, without consideration, any
dividend on the Common Stock payable in any right to acquire shares of Common Stock for no
consideration, then the Corporation shall be deemed to have made a dividend payable in shares
of Common Stock in an amount equal to the maximum number of shares issuable upon exercise
of such rights to acquire Common Stock.

(f) Adjustments for Reclassification and Reorganization. If the Common Stock
issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or a
different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock, whether by capital
reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares
provided for in paragraph (e) of this Section B.1(iv) above or a merger or other reorganization
referred to in paragraph (b) of Section B.1(iii) above), the Conversion Rate then in effect shall,

concurrently with the effectiveness of such reorganization or reclassification, be proportionately
adjusted so that the Series A Preferred Stock shall thereafter be convertible into, in lieu of the
number of shares of Common Stock which the holders would otherwise have been entitled to
receive, a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock equivalent to the number of
shares of Common Stock that would have been received by the holders upon conversion of the
Series A Preferred Stock immediately before that change.

(g) | No Impairment. The Corporation will not, by amendment of its Articles of
Incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger,
dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the
observance of performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the
Corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of
this Section B.1(iv) and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in
order to protect the Conversion Rate against impairment.

(h) Certificates as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Conversion Rate pursuant to this Section B.1(iv), the Corporation at its
expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms
hereof and prepare and furnish to each holder of Series A Preferred Stock a certificate executed
by the Corporation’s President or Chief Executive Officer setting forth such adjustment or
readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is
based. The Corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any such holder, furnish or
cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (1) such adjustments and
readjustments, (ii) the Conversion Rate at the time in effect, and (iii) the number of shares of
Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received
upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock.

(i) Notices of Record Date. In the event that the Corporation shall propose at any
time prior to the conversion of all outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock: (I) to
declare any dividend or distribution upon its Common Stock, whether in cash, property, stock or
other securities, whether or not a regular cash dividend and whether or not out of earnings or
earned surplus; (II) to offer for subscription pro rata to the holders of any class or series of its
stock any additional shares of stock of any class or series or other rights; (III) to effect any
reclassification or recapitalization of its Common Stock outstanding involving a change in the
Common Stock; or (IV) to merge or consolidate with or into any other corporation, or sell, lease
or convey all or substantially all of its assets, or to liquidate, dissolve or wind up; then, in
connection with each such event, the Corporation shall send to the holders of Series A Preferred
Stock:

(1) at least twenty (20) days’ prior written notice of the date on which a record
shall be taken for such dividend, distribution or subscription rights (and specifying the date on
which the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled thereto) or for determining rights to vote, if
any, in respect of the matters referred to in clauses (III) and (IV) above; and

(2) in the case of the matters referred to in clauses (III) and (IV) above, at
least twenty (20) days’ prior written notice of the date when the same shall take place (and
specifying the date on which the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to exchange their
Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon the occurrence of such event).

50487227.9
11
Gj) Issue Taxes. The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and other taxes that may
be payable in respect of any issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock on conversion of
Series A Preferred Stock pursuant hereto; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be
obligated to pay any transfer taxes resulting from any transfer requested by any holder in
connection with any such conversion.

(k) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at all
times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock,
solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock,
such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number
of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take
such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient
for such purpose, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite
shareholder approval of any necessary amendment to these Articles of Incorporation.

(1) Fractional Shares. No fractional share shall be issued upon the conversion of any
share or shares of Series A Preferred Stock. All shares of Common Stock (including fractions
thereof) issuable upon conversion of more than one share of Series A Preferred Stock by a holder
thereof shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the conversion would result in
the issuance of any fractional share. If, after the aforementioned aggregation, the conversion
would result in the issuance of a fraction of a share of Common Stock, the Corporation shall, in
lieu of issuing any fractional share, pay the holder otherwise entitled to such fraction a sum in
cash equal to the Fair Market Value of such fraction on the date of conversion.

(m) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Section B.1(iv) to be given
to the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, unless waived by the holder, shall be
deemed given if deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, or if sent by facsimile or
delivered personally by hand or nationally recognized courier and addressed to each holder of
record at such holder’s address or facsimile number appearing in the records of the Corporation.

the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock as nearly as may be in proportion to the outstanding

in writing by the Secretary of the Corporation and will:

(1) set out the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issued
and outstanding, on an As-If-Converted Basis, and each Series A Preferred Stock holder's
respective ownership of shares of Common Stock, on an As-If-Converted Basis, at the close of
business on the date of mailing of the Pre-emptive Right Offer,

50487227.9

15

(2) limit the time (the “Acceptance Time”) within which such offer
may be accepted (which time shall not be less than seven days nor more than 90 days after the
date of mailing of the Pre-emptive Right Offer),

(3) fix the time, date and place for completion of any purchase
resulting from acceptance of the Pre-emptive Right Offer, and

(4) direct each holder of Series A Preferred Stock to specify, in its
written subscription, the number and class of equity securities that party desires to purchase,
including, if any, the number of shares of capital stock (the “Additional Securities”) such holder
of Series A Preferred Stock is willing to purchase in excess of the Series A Preferred Stock
holder's pro rata entitlement.

(II) ‘If one or more holders of Series A Preferred Stock subscribe for less than
their respective proportions, the unsubscribed shares will be divided, within seven days of the
expiry of the Acceptance Time, pro-rata in proportion to the number of shares of Common Stock
held by them, on an As-If-Converted Basis, respectively among the holders of Series A Preferred
Stock who have requested Additional Securities, provided that no holder of Series A Preferred
Stock will be bound to take any securities in excess of the Additional Securities indicated in its
subscription. If the securities of any issue are not capable, without division into fractions of
shares, of being offered to or being divided among the holders of Series A Preferred Stock in the
proportions mentioned above, the same will be offered to or divided among the holders of Series
A Preferred Stock as nearly as may be in the proportions mentioned above and any balance will
be offered to or divided among the holders of Series A Preferred Stock or any of them in a
manner as may be determined by the Board.

(I)  Ifany of the securities of any issue are not subscribed for by the
Acceptance Time, the Corporation may offer the unsubscribed securities within the period
ending 90 days after the Acceptance Time to any Person, but the price at which the securities
may be allotted and issued will not be less than the subscription price offered to the holders of
Series A Preferred Stock and the terms of payment of the securities will not be more favourable
to such Person or Persons than the terms offered to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock.

(b) Exceptions to Pre-Emptive Rights. Notwithstanding Section B.1(iv)(a), no holder
of Series A Preferred Stock will have any Pre-Emptive Rights to purchase any shares of capital
stock of the Corporation issued:

(D) pursuant to the Option Plan;

(II) pursuant to the options, warrants or other rights that have been granted
pursuant to agreements entered into between the Corporation and the Nidus Center for Scientific
Enterprises, a Missouri non-profit corporation, and the options that will be granted pursuant to
employment and/or consulting agreements entered into by the Corporation with D. Graeme
Thomas, Niki Akers and Shelley Minteer;

(I) from the authorized un-issued Series A Preferred Shares if issued for a
price not less than $0.415702 for each Series A Preferred Share; or

50487227.9

16
(IV) inconnection with any Qualified Public Offering.

Cc. Terms of Common Stock.

The voting powers and relative, participating, optional and other special rights of the
Common Stock, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, are as follows:

1, Voting Rights and Powers. Except as provided in the GBL, the holders
of shares of the Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote per each share of Common Stock
and shall vote together as a single class (with the holders of Series A Preferred Stock entitled to
vote together with the holders of the shares of Common Stock) on all matters as to which such
holders are entitled to vote.

2. Dividend Rights. Cash or other types of dividends (other than fixed
dividends) may be declared and paid upon the Common Stock so long as (i) there are no Series A
Preferred Stock or other securities ranking prior to the Common Stock upon dissolution,
liquidation or winding up of the Corporation outstanding or (ii) such dividends are declared and
paid upon the Series A Preferred Stock at the same time and in the same amount as the Common
Stock. In determining the amount of the dividend per share, the Series A Preferred Stock shall
be on an as-converted basis. Thereafter, dividends may be declared and paid upon the Common
Stock in such amounts and at such times as the Board of Directors may determine. Funds
otherwise legally available for the payment of dividends on the Common Stock shall not be
restricted or reduced by reason of there being any excess of the aggregate preferential amount of
Series A Preferred Stock outstanding over the aggregate par value thereof.

3. Liquidation Rights. In the event of any Dissolution Event, after there
shall have been paid or set apart for payment of holders of any outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred Stock the full preferential amounts to which they are entitled under Section B.1(iii) the
remaining assets and funds of the Corporation, if any, shall be distributed among the holders of
the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Common Stock, pro rata based on the number of
shares of Common Stock held or deemed held by each such holder, treating for this purpose all
such securities as if they had been converted to Common Stock pursuant to the terms of the
Articles of Incorporation immediately prior to such Dissolution Event.

4. Pre-Emptive Rights. The holders of Common Stock shall have no Pre-
Emptive Rights.

FIFTH. All corporate powers of the Corporation shall be exercised by or under the
direction of the Board of Directors except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable law. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by law, the Board of Directors is
expressly authorized:

(i) to adopt, amend or repeal By-laws of the Corporation, subject to the right of
the shareholders of the Corporation entitled to vote with respect thereto to adopt By-laws and to
amend or repeal By-laws made by the Board of Directors; and

(ii) from time to time to determine whether and to what extent, at what time and
place, and under what conditions and regulations the accounts and books of the Corporation, or

50487227.9

17

any of them, shall be open to the inspection of any shareholder; and no shareholder shall have
any right to inspect any account or book or document of the Corporation except as provided by
applicable law or the By-laws of the Corporation, as authorized by resolution of the shareholders
or Board of Directors of the Corporation or as set forth in any agreement among the Corporation
and any of its shareholders.

SIXTH. No director of the Corporation or any person acting at the direction of the
Board of Directors shall be personally liable to the Corporation or its shareholders for monetary
damages for any breach of fiduciary duty by such director as a director; provided, however, that
the foregoing shall not be deemed to eliminate or limit the liability of a director to the extent
provided by applicable law (i) for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the Corporation
or its shareholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional
misconduct or a knowing violation of law, or (iii) for any transaction from which the director
derived an improper personal benefit. This provision is not intended to eliminate or narrow any
defenses to or protection against liability otherwise available to directors of the Corporation. No
amendment to or repeal of this Article Sixth shall apply to or have any effect on the liability or
alleged liability of any director of the Corporation for or with respect to any acts or omissions of
such director occurring prior to such amendment. Any person or persons who, pursuant to any
provision of these Articles of Incorporation, exercises or performs any of the powers or duties
conferred or imposed upon a director of the Corporation shall be treated as a director for
purposes of this Article Sixth and shall be entitled to the limitation of liability set forth in this
Article Sixth.

SEVENTH.

A. Every person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to
or is involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that such person or a person of
whom such person is a legal representative is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or is
or was serving at the request of the Corporation or for its benefit as a director, officer, employee
or agent of any other corporation, or as the representative of the Corporation in a partnership,
joint venture, trust or other entity, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to
the fullest extent legally permissible under the GBL, as amended from time to time, against all
expenses, liabilities and losses (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid or
to be paid in settlement) reasonably paid or incurred by such person in connection therewith.
Such right of indemnification shall be a contract right that may be enforced in any manner
desired by such person. Such right of indemnification shall include the right to be paid by the
Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such action, suit or proceeding in advance of
its final disposition upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay such
amount if ultimately it should be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by
the Corporation under the GBL. Such right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any
other right which such directors, officers or representatives may have or hereafter acquire and,
without limiting the generality of such statement, they shall be entitled to their respective rights
of indemnification under any By-law, agreement, vote of shareholders, provision of law or
otherwise, as well as their rights under this Article Seventh.

B. The Board of Directors may adopt By-laws from time to time with respect
to indemnification to provide at all times the fullest indemnification permitted by the GBL, as

50487227.9

18

amended from time to time, and may cause the Corporation to purchase and maintain insurance
on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation,
or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation or for its benefit as a director, officer,
employee or agent of any other corporation, or as the representative of the Corporation in a
partnership, joint venture, trust or other entity, against any expense, liability or loss asserted
against or incurred by any such person in any such capacity or arising out of any such status,
whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such
expense, liability or loss.

EIGHTH. Except as other as otherwise provided in these Articles of Incorporation,
the Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in
these Articles of Incorporation in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all
rights conferred upon shareholders, directors and officers herein are granted subject to this
reservation.

10 S. Jackson Street, Ste. 200
