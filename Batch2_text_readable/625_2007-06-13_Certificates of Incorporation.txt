4, Conversion, The holders of the Preferred Stock have conversion rights us follows
(the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the
option of the holder thereof. at any time after the date of issuance of such share at the office of the
corporation or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, into such number of fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Issuance Price by the
Conversion Price, determined as hereinafter provided, in effect at the time of the conversion (the
“Conversion Rate”). The Issuance Price for the Series C, Series B, Series A and Series A Prime
Preferred Stock shall be $1.00, $0.72, $0.60 and $0.60 per share, respectively, The Conversion Price
for the Series C, Series B, Series A and Series A Prime Preferred Stock shall initially be $1.00,
$0.72, $0.60 and $0.60 per share, respectively, Such initial Conversion Price shall be subject to
adjustment as hereinafter provided.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be
converted into shares of Common Stock at the then effective Conversion Rate (i) immediately prior
to the closing of a firm commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration
statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, covering the offer and sale of Common
Stock for the account of the corporation to the public in which the public offering price exceeds
(prior to underwriter’s discounts or commissions and offering expenses) $5.00 per share (adjusted
for any subsequent stock splits, stock dividends, reclassifications or recapitalizations) and the
agpregate gross proceeds raised exceeds $50,000,000 or (ii) on the date upon which the corporation
obtains the consent of the holders of a majority of the shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding,
voting together on an as-converted basis. In the event of the automatic conversion of the Preferred
Stock upon a public offering as aforesaid, the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock |
issuable upon such conversion of Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such
Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to convert the same into full shares of Common Stock and to receive certificates therefor,
such holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the
corporation or of any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the
corporation at such office that such holder elects to convert the same; provided, however, that in the
event of an automatic conversion pursuant to Section 1V4(b), the outstanding shares of Preferred
Steck shall be converted automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and
whether or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the corporation or its
transfer agent, and provided further that the corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates
evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such automatic conversion unless the
certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are either delivered to the corporation or its
transfer agent as provided above, or the holder notifies the corporation or its transfer agent that such
certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to’ the
corporation to indemnify the corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such
certificates. The corporation shall, as soon as practicable after such delivery, or such agreement and
indemnification in the case of a lost certificate, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of
Preferred Stock, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which the
holder shall be entitled as aforesaid and a check payable to the holder in the amount of any cash
amounts payable as the result of a conversion into fractional shares of Common Stock. Such
conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date
of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, or in the case of automatic
conversion on the date of closing of the offering and the person or persons entitled to receive the _
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the
record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date.

(d) Fractional Shares. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder of
Preferred Stock would otherwise be entitled, the corporation may pay cash equal to such fraction
multiplied by the then effective fair market value or round such fractional share up to a whole share
(after aggregating all shares into which shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder could be
converted). Whether or not fractional shares are issuable upon such conversion shall be determined
on the basis of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock of each holder at the time converting

into Common Stock and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such aggregate
conversion.

(c) Adjustment of Conversion Price. The Conversion Price of Preferred Stock
shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

(i) If the corporation shall issue (or, pursuant to Section IV 4(e)(1)(B)(z)
hereof, shall be deemed to have issued) any Common Stock other than “Excluded Stock’’ (as defined
below) for a consideration per share less than the Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock
in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Common Stock (excluding stock dividends,
subdivisions, stock splits, combinations, dividends or recapitalizations which are covered by
Sections IV4(e)(iii) IV4(e)(iv), and 1V4(e)(v)) (the “Additional Shares”), the Conversion Price for
such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately afler each such issuance of Additional Shares
shall forthwith (except as provided in this Section [V4(c¢)) be adjusted as follows:

(A) For each series of Preferred Stock, to a price (calculated to the
nearest cent) equal to the product obtained by multiplying the Conversion Price for such series of
Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such issuance of Additional Shares by a fraction,

(1) the numerator of which is equal to the sum of

(x) the total number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding (including any shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of or excrcise of, as
the case may be, outstanding Preferred Stock, options, warrants or other convertible securities, or
deemed to be issued pursuant to Section 1V4(c)(i)(B)(z) immediately prior to such issuance of
Additional Shares, plus

(y) the number of shares of Common Stock that the
agpregate consideration received by this Corporation for such issuance of Additional Shares would
purchase at the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to
such jssuance of Additional Shares; and

(2) the denominator of which is equal to the sum of

. (x) the total number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding (including any shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of or exercise of, as
the case may be, outstanding Preferred Stock, options, warrants or other convertible securities, or
deemed to be issued pursuant to Section IV4(e)(i)(B)(z) immediately prior to such issuance of
Additional Shares, plus

(y) the number of shares of Additional Shares issued.

(B) For the purposes of any adjustment of the Conversion Price for
any series of Preferred Stock pursuant to this clause (i), the following provisions shal} be applicable:

discounts or commissions paid or incurred by the corporation in connection with the issuance and
sale thereof.

(y) In the case of the issuance of Common Stock for a
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be deemed
1o be the fair value thereof as reasonably determined by the board of directors of the corporation, in
accordance with generally accepted accounting treatment; provided, however, that if, at the time of
such determination, the corporation’s Common Stock is traded in the over-the-counter market or on
a national or regional securities exchange, such fair market value as determined by the board of
directors of the corporation shall not exceed the aggregate “Current Market Price” (as defined
below) of the shares of Common Stock being issued.

(z) In the case of the issuance of (1) options to purchase or
rights to subscribe for Common Stock, (ii) securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable
for Common Stack, or (iii) options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or
exchangeable securities:

(1) the aggregate maximum number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon
exercise of such options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common Stock
shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such options or rights were
issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the
manner provided in subdivisions (x) and (y) above), if any, received by the
corporation upon the issuance of such options or rights plus the minimum
purchase price provided in such options or rights for the Common Stock
covered thereby;

(2) the aggregate maximum number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon
conversion of or in exchange for any such convertible or exchangeable
securities, or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for
such convertible or exchangeable securitics and subsequent conversion or
exchange thereof, shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such
securities were issued or such options or rights were issued and for a
consideration equal to the consideration received by the corporation for any
such securities and related options or rights (excluding any cash received on
account of accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the additional
minimum consideration, if any, to be received by the corporation upon the
conversion or exchange of such securities or the exercise of any related
options or rights (the consideration in each case to be determined in the
manner provided in subdivisions (x) and (y) above);

(3) on any change in the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon
exercise of any such options or rights or conversion of or exchange for such
convertible or exchangeable securities, or on any change in the minimum
purchase price of such options, rights or securities, other than a change
resulting from the antidilution provisions of such options, rights Or securities,
the Conversion Price shall forthwith be readjusted to such Conversion Price as
would have been obtained had the adjustment made upon (x) the issuance of
such options, rights or securities not exercised, converted or exchanged prior
{o such change or (y) the options or rights relaied to such securities not
converted or exchanged prior to such change, as the case may be, been made
upon the basis of such change; and

(4) on the expiration of any such options or rights, the termination of any such
rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options or rights related
to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Conversion Price shall
forthwith be readjusted to such Conversion Price as would have been obtained
had the adjustment made upon the issuance of such options, nights, convertible
or exchangeable securities or options or rights relate to such convertible or
exchangeable securities, as the case may be, been made upon the basis of the
issuance of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually issued upon

or rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, as the case
may be,

Section 1V4(e)(i) above.

(iii) If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any time afer
the date hereof is increased by a stock dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or by a _
subdivision or split-up of shares of Common Stock, then, on the date such payment is made or such
change is effective, the Conversion Price of Preferred Stock shall be appropriately decreased so that
the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of any shares of Preferred Stock shall
be increased in proportion to such increase of outstanding shares.

(iv) If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any time after
the date hereof is decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, then, on
the effective date of such combination, the Conversion Price of Preferred Stock shall be

continuing entity and which does not result in any change in the Common Stock or a consolidation or
merger where Section 2 applies), the shares of Preferred Stock shall, afier such reorganization,
reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale or other disposition, be convertible into the kind and
