(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at
the option of the holder thereof, at any time and from time to time, and without the payment of
additiona] consideration by the holder thereof, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable
shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing (i) $1.3648 (as adjusted for any stock
dividend, stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization affecting such shares) in the
case of the Series A-1(A) Preferred Stock, (ii) $1.3648 (as adjusted for any stock dividend, stock
split, combination or other similar recapitalization affecting such shares) in the case of the
Series A-1(T) Preferred Stock, and (iii) $1.3648 (as adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split,
combination or other similar recapitalization affecting such shares) in the case of the Series B
Preferred Stock, by the Series A-1(A) Conversion Price (as defined below), the Series A-1(T)
Conversion Price (as defined below), or the Series B Conversion Price (as defined below), as
may be applicable, in effect at the time of conversion. The “Series A-1(A) Conversion Price”
shall initially be $1.3648, The ‘Series A-1(T) Conversion Price” shall initially be $1.3648. The
“Seri¢s B Conversion Price” shall initially be $1.3648. Such initial Series A-1(A) Conversion
Price, initial Series A-1(T) Conversion Price and initial Series B Conversion Price, and the rate

Series B Conversion Price are occasionally referred to herein collectively as the “Conversion

In the event of a liquidation of the Corporation, the Conversion Rights shall terminate at
the close of business on the first full day preceding the date fixed for the payment of any
amounts distributable on such liquidation to the holders of Preferred Stock.

(b) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued
upon conversion of the Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder
would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by
the then-effective Conversion Price, as may be applicable.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion.

(i) In order for a holder of Preferred Stock to convert shares of
Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the certificate or
certificates for such shares of Preferred Stock at the office of the transfer agent for the
Corporation (or at the principal office of the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own
transfer agent), together with written notice that such holder elects to convert all or any number
of the shares of the Preferred Stock represented by such certificate or certificates. Such notice
shall state such holder's name or the names of the nominees in which such holder wishes the
certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued. If required by the
Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by a
written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly
executed by the registered holder or his or its attorney duly authorized in writing. The date of
receipt of such certificates and notice by the transfer agent (or by the Corporation if the
Corporation serves as its own transfer agent) shall be the conversion date (“Conversion Date”),
and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the shares represented by such
certificate shall be deemed to be outstanding of record as of such date. The Corporation shall, as
soon as practicable after the Conversion Date, issue and deliver at such office to such bolder of
Preferred Stock (or to the extent that such issuance and delivery will not violate applicable
federal and state securities laws, his or its nominees), a certificate or certificates for the number
of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled, together with cash in lieu of
any fraction of a share,

(ii) | The Corporation shall at all times when Preferred Stock shall ‘be
outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued stock, for the purpose
of effecting the conversion of Preferred Stock, such number of its duly authorized shares of
Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding
Preferred Stock. Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment reducing the then
applicable Conversion Price below the then par value of the shares of Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of the series of Preferred Stock, as may be applicable, the Corporation will take
any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the
Corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock
at such adjusted Series A-1(A) Conversion Price, Series A-1(T) Conversion Price or Series B
Conversion Price, as may be applicable.-

(iif) Upon any such conversion, no adjustment to the applicable
Conversion Price shall be made for any declared but unpaid dividends on the Preferred Stock, as
may be applicable, surrendered for conversion or on the Common Stock- delivered upon
conversion.

iv) All shares of Preferred Stock which shall have been surrendered
for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights with
respect to such shares, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and to vote (other than as a
holder of Common Stock), shall immediately cease and terminate on the Conversion Date,
except only the right of the holders thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange
therefor and payment of any dividends declared but unpaid thereon. Any shares of Preferred
Stock so converted shall be retired and cancelled and shall not be reissued, and the Corporation
(without the need for stockholder action) may from time to time take such appropriate action as
may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Preferred Stock, as may be
applicable, accordingly.

(v) The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and other taxes that
may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon
conversion of shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4. The Corporation shall not,
however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in
the issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in which the
- shares of Preferred Stock 50 converted were registered, and no such issuance or delivery shall be
made unless and until the person or entity requesting such issuance has paid to the Corporation
the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax
has been paid.

Conversion Price by a fraction, (A) the numerator of which shall be (1) the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus (2) the number of shares of
Common Stock which the aggregate consideration received or to be received by the Corporation
for the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued would purchase at such
applicable Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance; and (B) the
denominator of which shall be (1) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to such issue plus (2) the number of such Additional Shares of Common Stock
so issued; provided that, (i) for the purpose of this Subsection 4(d)(v), all shares of Common
Stock issuable upon the exercise of Options and/or the conversion, exercise and/or exchange of
Convertible Securities outstanding immediately prior to such issue shall be deemed to be
outstanding, and (ii) the nuimber of shares of Common Stock deemed issuable upon the exercise
of Options and the conversion, exercise and/or exchange of such outstanding Convertible
Securities shall not give effect to any adjustments to the conversion or exchange price or
conversion or exchange rate of such Options or Convertible Securities resulting from the
issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock that is the subject of this calculation.

(B) in the case of the Series B Preferred Stock, the Scries B
Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to the lowest price per share at
which any of the Additional Shares of Common Stock are issued.

4(d), the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional Shares of
Common Stock shall be computed as follows:

(D insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
aggregate of cash received by the Corporation,
excluding amounts paid or payable for accrued
interest;

(1) _ insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair market value thereof at the
time of such issue, as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors; and

(1) in the evont, Additional Shares of Common Stock
are issued together with other shares or securities or
other assets of the Corporation for consideration

consideration so received for such Additional
Shares of Common Stock, computed as provided in
clauses (I) and (11) above, as determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors.

(B) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per
share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been -
issued pursuant to Subsection 4(d)(iv), relating to Options and Convertible Securities, shall be
determined by dividing

(x) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by
the Corporation as consideration for the issue of sach Options or Convertible Securities, plus the
minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating
thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such
consideration) payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the
exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities, by

(y) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock

for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the
conversion, exercise and/or exchange of such Convertible Securities or in the case of Options for

more than one date Additional Shares of Common Stock of the same series or class in a series of
one or more related transactions, and such issuance dates occur within a period of no more than
120 days, then, upon the final such issuance, the applicable Conversion Price shall be readjusted
to give effect to all such issuances as if they occurred on the date of the final such issuance (and
without giving effect to any adjustments as a result of such prior issuances within such period).
(¢) djustm or binatjons. If the Corporation shall at
any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date effect a subdivision of the outstanding
Common Stock, the applicable Conversion Price then in effect immediately before that
subdivision shall be proportionately decreased. If the Corporation shall at any time or from time
to time after the Original Issue Date combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock, the
applicable Conversion Price then in effect immediately before the combination shall be

fix a record date for the determination of. holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a
dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock, then and in each
such event the applicable Conversion Price then in effect immediately before such event shall be
decreased as of the time of such issuance or, in the event such a record date shall have been
fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, by multiplying such applicable Conversion
Price then in effect by a fraction:

(1) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the
close of business on such record date, and

(2) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the
close of business on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in
payment of such dividend or distribution;

provided, however, if such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend is not fully paid
or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the applicable Conversion
Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record date and
thereafter the applicable Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this paragraph as of the
time of actual payment of such dividends or distributions; and provided further, however, that no
such adjustment shall be made if the holders of Preferred Stock simultaneously receive a
dividend or other distribution of shares of Common Stock in a number equal to the number of
shares of Common Stock as they would have received if all outstanding shares of Preferred
Stock had been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event.

(g) justments for Other Divi jstributions. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall make or issue, or

event provision shall be made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock shall receive upon
conversion thereof in addition to the number of shares of Common Stock receivable thereupon,

have been entitled to receive had the Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock on the

14
date of such event and had they thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to and
including the conversion date, retained such securities receivable by them as aforesaid during
such period, giving application to all adjustments called for during such period under this
paragraph with respect to the rights of the holders of the applicable series of Preferred Stock;
provided, however, that no such adjustment shall be made if the holders of the applicable series
of Preferred Stock simultaneously receive a dividend or other distribution of such securities, cash
or other property in an amount equal to the amount of such securities as they would have
received if all outstanding shares of such applicable series of Preferred Stock had been converted
into Common Stock on the date of such event.

(h) Adjustment for Merger or Reorganization, etc. If there shall occur any
reorganization, recapitalization, consolidation or merger involving the Corporation in which the
Common Stock (but not the Preferred Stock) is converted into or exchanged for securities, cash
or other property (other than a transaction covered by Section 2 or by paragraphs (e), (f) or (g) of
this Section 4 or a change in par value or from par value to no par value or from no par value to
par value), then, following any such reorganization, recapitalization, consolidation or merger,
each share of Preferred Stock shall (except, in the case of any merger or consolidation, to the
extent that payment shall have been made pursuant to Section 2(d)) be convertible into the kind
and amount of securities, cash or other property which a holder of the number of shares of
Common Stock of the Corporation issuable upon the conversion of one share of Preferred Stock
immediately prior to such reorganization, recapitalization, consolidation or merger would have
been entitled to receive pursuant to such transaction; and, in such case, appropriate adjustment
(as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) shall be made in the application of the
provisions in this Section 4 set forth with respect to the rights and interest thereafter of the
holders of the Preferred Stock, to the end that the provisions set forth in this Section 4 (including
provisions with respect to changes in and other adjustments of the Series A-1(A) Conversion
Price, the Series A-1(T) Conversion Price and the Series B Conversion Price, as may be
