Common Stock or other securities and rights convertible into or entitling the holder thereof to
receive, directly or indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock of this corporation) on the
Common Stock of this corporation, at the rate of $0.05 per share per annum for the Series A and
Series A Prime Preferred Stock or, if greater (as determined on a per annum basis and on an as
converted basis for the Preferred Stock), an ammount equal to that paid on any other outstanding
shares of this corporation. No dividends shall be paid on any shares of Common Stock unless a
dividend (including the amount of any dividend paid pursuant to the above provision) is paid with
respect to all outstanding shares of Series A and Series A Prime Preferred Stock in an amount for
each such share of Series A and Series A Prime Preferred Stock equal to or greater than the

(including amounts previously paid as a Preferred Stock Preference) equal to $1.80 (subject to
adjustment of such fixed dollar amount for any stock splits, stock dividends, combinations,
recapitalizations or the like). The entire remaining assets and funds of the corporation legally
available for distribution, if any, shall be distributed ratably among the holders of Common Stock.

(c) Reorganization or Merger. A merger or reorganization of the corporation with

transaction own immediately after such transaction less than 50% of the equity securities of the
surviving corporation or its parent, shall be deemed to be a liquidation within the meaning of this
Section 2.

(4) Noncash Distributions. If any of the assets of the corporation are to be
distributed other than in cash under Section IV2(c) or for any purpose, then the board of directors of
the corporation shall promptly engage mdependent competent appraisers to determine the value of
the assets to be distributed to the holders of Preferred Stock. The corporation shall, upon receipt of

period ending three (3) business days prior to the closing;

Gi) If actively traded over-the-counter (other than on the Nasdaq National
Market), the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid prices over the 30-day period

Preferred Stock shall be entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of shares of Common
Stock into which each share of Preferred Stock could be converted on the record date for the vote or
written consent of shareholders and shall have voting rights and powers equal to the voting rights
and powers of the Common Stock when voting together with the Common Stock as a single class,
which shall include, but not be limited to, the election of directors. The holder of each share of
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to notice of any shareholders’ meeting in accordance with the
bylaws of the corporation and upon any other matter submitted to a vote of shareholders, except

permitted and any fractional voting rights resulting from the above formula (after aggregating all

CAwindows\TEMPPALIB2_ 2643527 2. DOC 3

converted) shall be rounded to the nearest whole number (with one-half rounded upward to one).

4, Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock have conversion rights as follows
(the “Conversion Rights”): ,

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the
option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share at the office of the
corporation or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, into such number of fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Issuance Price by the
Conversion Price, determined as hereinafter provided, in effect at the time of the conversion (the
“Conversion Rate”). The Issuance Price for the Series A and Series A Prime Preferred Stock shall
be $0.60 per share. The Conversion Price for the Series A and Series A Prime Preferred Stock shall
initially be $0.60 per share. Such initial Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment as
hereinafter provided.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall
automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the then effective Conversion Rate
(i) immediately prior to the closing of a firm commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to
an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, covering the offer
and sale of Common Stock for the account of the corporation to the public in which the public
offering price exceeds (prior to undervwriter’s discounts or commissions and offering expenses) $2.40
per share (adjusted for any subsequent stock splits, stock dividends, reclassifications or
recapitalizations) and the aggregate gross proceeds raised exceeds $10,000,000 or (ii) on the date
upon which the corporation obtains the consent of the holders of a majority of the shares of Series A
Preferred Stock then outstanding, voting as a class. Each share of Series A Prime Preferred Stock
shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the then effective Conversion Rate
(i) immediately prior to the closing of a firm commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to
an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, covering the offer

Ci\windows\TEMPIPALIB2 2643527_2.D0C 4

and sale of Common Stock for the account of the corporation to the public in which the public

_offering price exceeds (prior to underwriter’s discounts or commissions and offering expenses) $2.40
per share (adjusted for any subsequent stock splits, stock dividends, reclassifications or
recapitalizations) and the aggregate gross proceeds raised exceeds $50,000,000 or (ii) on the date
upon which the corporation obtains the consent of the holders of a majority of the shares of Series A
Prime Preferred Stock then outstanding, voting as a class, In the event of the automatic conversion of
the Preferred Stock upon a public offering as aforesaid, the person(s) entitled to receive the Common
Stock issuable upon such conversion of Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such
Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shal] be
entitled to convert the same into full shares of Common Stock and to receive certificates therefor,
such holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the
corporation or of any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the
corporation at such office that such holder elects to convert the same; provided, however, that in the
event of an automatic conversion pursuant to Section IV4(b), the outstanding shares of Preferred
Stock shall be converted automatically without any fimrther action by the holders of such shares and
whether or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the corporation or its
transfer agent, and provided further that the corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates
evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such automatic conversion unless the
certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are either delivered to the corporation or its
transfer agent as provided above, or the holder notifies the corporation or its transfer agent that such
_ certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the
corporation to indemnify the corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such
certificates. The corporation shall, as soon as practicable after such delivery, or such agreement and
indemnification in the case of a lost certificate, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of
Preferred Stock, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which the
holder shall be entitled as aforesaid and a check payable to the holder in the amount of any cash
amounts payable as the result of a conversion into fractional shares of Common Stock. Such
conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date
of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, or in the case of automatic
conversion on the date of closing of the offering and the person or persons entitled to receive the
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the
record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date.

(d} ‘Fractional Shares, In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder of
Preferred Stock would otherwise be entitled, the corporation may pay cash equal to such fraction
multiplied by the then effective fair market value or round such fractional share up to a whole share
(after aggregating all shares into which shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder could be
converted). Whether or not fractional shares are issuable upon such conversion shall be determined
on the basis of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock of each holder at the time converting
into Common Stock and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such aggregate
conversion.

CAwindows\TEMPPALYB2_2643527_2.D0C 5

(e) Adjustment of Conversion Price. The Conversion Price of Preferred Stock
shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

(i) If the corporation shall issue (or, pursuant to Section IV4(e)(i)(C)(z)
hereof, shall be deemed to have issued) any Common Stock other than “Excluded Stock” (as defined
below) for a consideration per share less than the Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock
in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Common Stock (excluding stock dividends,
subdivisions, stock splits, combinations, dividends or recapitalizations which are covered by
Sections [V4(e)(iii) [V4(e)(iv), and TV4(e)(v)) (the “Additional Shares”), the Conversion Price for
such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately after each such issuance of Additional Shares
shall forthwith (except as provided in this Section [V4(e)) be adjusted as follows:

(A) For the Series A Preferred Stock, to a price (calculated to the
nearest cent) equal to the product obtained by multiplying the Conversion Price for such series of
Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such issuance of Additional Shares by a fraction,

(1) the numerator of which is equal to the sum of

(x) the total number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding (including any shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of or exercise of, as
the case may be, outstanding Preferred Stock, options, warrants or other convertible securities, or
deemed to be issued pursuant to Section IV4{e)@)(C)(z) immediately prior to such issuance of
Additional Shares, plus

(y) the number of shares of Common Stock that the
ageregate consideration received by this Corporation for such issuance of Additional Shares would
purchase at the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to
such issuance of Additional Shares; and

(2) the denominator of which is equal to the sum of
(x) the total number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding (including any shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of or exercise of, as
the case may be, outstanding Preferred Stock, options, warrants or other convertible securities, or
deemed to be issued pursuant to Section IV4(e)(7)(C)(z) immediately prior to such issuance of
Additional Shares, plus
{y) the number of shares of Additional Shares issued.

(B) ‘For the Series A Prime Preferred Stock, to a price equal to the

any series of Preferred Stock pursuant to this clause (i), the following provisions shall be applicable:

CcWwindows\TEMPAPALTR2_2643527_2. DOC 6

discounts or commissions paid or incurred by the corporation in connection with the issuance and
sale thereof,

(y) In the case of the issuance of Common Stock for a
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be deemed
to be the fair value thereof as reasonably determined by the board of directors of the corporation, in
accordance with generally accepted accounting treatment; provided, however, that if, at the time of
such determination, the corporation’s Common Stock is traded in the over-the-counter market or on
a national or regional securities exchange, such fair market value as determined by the board of
directors of the corporation shall not exceed the aggregate “Current Market Price” (as defined
below) of the shares of Common Stock being issued.

(z) In the case of the issuance of (i) options to purchase or
tights to subscribe for Common Stock, (ii) securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable
for Common Stock, or (iif) options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or
exchangeable securities:

(1) the ageregate maximum number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon
exercise of such options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common Stock
shali be deemed to have been issued at the time such options or rights were
issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the
manner provided in subdivisions (x) and (y) above), if any, received by the
corporation upon the issuance of such options or rights plus the minimum
purchase price provided in such options or rights for the Common Stock
covered thereby;

(2) the aggregate maximum number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon
conversion of or in exchange for any such convertible or exchangeable
securities, or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for
such convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or
exchange thereof, shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such
securities were issued or such options or rights were issued and for a
consideration equal to the consideration received by the corporation for any
such securities and related options or rights (excluding any cash received on
account of accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the additional
minimum consideration, if any, to be received by the corporation upon the
conversion or exchange of such securities or the exercise of any related
options or rights (the consideration in each case to be determined in the
manner provided in subdivisions (x) and (y) above);

(3) on any change in the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon
exercise of any such options or rights or conversion of or exchange for such

CAwindows\TEMP\PALIB2_2643527_2. DOC 7

convertible or exchangeable securities, or on any change in the minimum
purchase price of such options, rights or securities, other than a change
resulting from the antidilution provisions of such options, rights or securities,
the Conversion Price shall forthwith be readjusted to such Conversion Price as
would have obtained had the adjustment made upon (x) the issuance of such
options, rights or securities not exercised, converted or exchanged prior to
such change or (y) the options or rights related to such securities not converted
or exchanged prior to such change, as the case may be, been made upon the
basis of such change; and

(4) on the expiration of any such options or rights, the termination of any such
rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options or rights related
to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Conversion Price shall
forthwith be readjusted to such Conversion Price as would have obtained had
the adjustment made upon the issuance of such options, rights, convertible or
exchangeable securities or options or rights relate to such convertible or
exchangeable securities, as the case may be, been made upon the basis of the
issuance of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually issued upon

such convertible or exchangeable securities or upon the exercise of the options
or rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, as the case
may be.

Preferred Stock) shall be deemed to be outstanding for all purposes of the computations of
Section [V4(e)(i) above.

(iii) If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any time
after the date hereof is increased by a stock dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or by a
subdivision or split-up of shares of Common Stock, then, on the date such payment is made or such
change is effective, the Conversion Price of Preferred Stock shall be appropriately decreased so that
the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of any shares of Preferred Stock shal]
be increased in proportion to such increase of outstanding shares.

(iv) If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any time
after the date hereof is decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of Common Stock,
then, on the effective date of such combination, the Conversion Price of Preferred Stock shall be
appropriately increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of
any shares of Preferred Stock shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares.

(vy) In case, at any time after the date hereof, of any capital reorganization,
or any reclassification of the stock of the corporation (other than as a result of a stock dividend or
subdivision, split-up or combination of shares), or the consolidation or merger of the corporation
with or into another person (other than a consolidation or merger in which the corporation is the
continuing entity and which does not result in any change in the Common Stock or a consolidation
or merger where Section 2 applies), the shares of Preferred Stock shall, after such reorganization,
reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale or other disposition, be convertible into the kind and
number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the corporation or otherwise to which
such holder would have been entitled if immediately prior to such reorganization, reclassification,
consolidation, merger, sale or other disposition such holder had converted its shares of Preferred
Stock into Common Stock: The provisions of this clause (v) shall similarly apply to successive
reorganizations, reclassifications, consolidations, mergers, sales or other dispositions.

(vi) All calculations under this Section 4 shalf be made to the nearest cent
or to the nearest one hundredth (1/100) of a share, as the case may be.

CaAwindows\TEMPPALIB2_2643527_2. DOC 9

Minimal Adjustments, No adjustment in the Conversion Price for any series
of Preferred Stock need be made if such adjustment would result in a change in the Conversion Price
of less than $0.01. Any adjustment of less than $0.01 which is not made shal] be carried forward and
shall be made at the time of and together with any subsequent adjustment which, on a cumulative
basis, amounts to an adjustment of $0.01 or more in the Conversion Price.

(g} No Impairment. The corporation will not through any reorganization,
recapitalization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or
any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms
to be observed or performed hereunder by the corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in
the carrying out of all the provisions of this Section 4 and in the taking of all such action as may be
necessary or appropriate in order to protect the Conversion Rights of the holders of Preferred Stock
against impairment. This provision shall not restrict the corporation’s right to amend its Articles of
Incorporation with the requisite shareholder consent.

readjustment of the Conversion Rate for any series of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4, the
corporation at its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance
with the terms hereof and prepare and furnish to each holder of such series of Preferred Stock a

of determining the holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash
dividend) or other distribution, any right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares
of stock of any class or any other securities or property or to receive any other right, the corporation
shall mail to each holder of Preferred Stock at least twenty (20) days prior to such record date, a
notice specifying the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend
or distribution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right. In the
event of a liquidation distribution pursuant to Section 2 hereof, the corporation shall mail to each
holder of Preferred Stock at least twenty (20) days prior to the date of such distribution a notice

Preferred Stock and Common Stock, (y) the amount expected to be distributed pursuant to Section 2
in respect of each share of each outstanding series of Preferred Stock and each share of Common

of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of
Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock, the corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel,
be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of
shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.

(i) Reissuance of Converted Shares. No shares of Preferred Stock which have
been converted into Common Stock after the original issuance thereof shall ever again be reissued
