(d) | Mechanics of Conversion.

(i) If a holder of Preferred Stock elects to convert shares of Preferred
Stock into shares of Common Stock pursuant to subsection (a) above, such holder shall surrender
the certificate or certificates for such shares of Preferred Stock at the principal office of the
Corporation together with written notice that such holder elects to convert all or any number of
the shares of the Preferred Stock represented by such certificate or certificates. Such notice shall
State such holder’s name or the names of the nominees in which such holder wishes the
certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued and the effective date of the
conversion (the “Conversion Date”), which may be any date within the sixty (60)-day period
following the date on which such notice is received by the Corporation. If required by the
Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by a
written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form Satisfactory to the Corporation, duly
executed by the registered holder or such holder’s attorney duly authorized in writing. The
converting holder shall be deemed to be the record holder of the resulting shares of Common
Stock on the Conversion Date and the Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after the
Conversion Date (and in any event within fifteen (15) business days), issue and deliver at such
office of such holder of Preferred Stock, or to such holder’s nominees, a certificate or certificates
for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled, together with
payment in lieu of any fraction of a share pursuant to Section 4(b) above.

(ii) | The Corporation shall at all times when the Preferred Stock shall
be outstanding reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued stock, for the
purpose of effecting the conversion of the Preferred Stock, such number of its duly authorized
shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all
outstanding Preferred Stock. Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment
reducing the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock below the then par value of the
shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such series of Preferred Stock, the
Corporation will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, take any corporate action which may,

sd-544777 -8-
in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Corporation may validly and legally
issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion Price
for such series of Preferred Stock.

(iii) Upon any such conversion, no adjustment to the Conversion Price
Shall be made for any declared or accrued but unpaid dividends on the Preferred Stock
surrendered for conversion or on the Common Stock delivered upon conversion,

(iv) On the Conversion Date, all Shares of Preferred Stock which shall
have been surrendered for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be
outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares, including the rights, if any, to receive
Notices and to vote, shall immediately cease and terminate, except only the right of the holders
thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor and payment of any dividends
declared or accrued but unpaid thereon. Any shares of Preferred Stock so converted shall be
retired and cancelled and shall not be reissued, and the Corporation (without the need for
stockholder action) may from thereafter take such appropriate action as may be necessary to
reduce the authorized Preferred Stock accordingly.

(v) The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and other taxes (other
than taxes based on income) that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares
of Common Stock upon conversion of shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4. The
Corporation shall not, however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of
any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other
than that in which the shares of Preferred Stock so converted were registered, and no such
issuance or delivery shall be made unless and until the person or entity requesting such issuance
has paid to the Corporation the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of
the Corporation, that such tax has been paid.

(e) Adjustment for Dilution. If at any time on or after the date upon which
this Restated Certificate is accepted by the Secretary of the State of Delaware (the “Filing

Date”), the Corporation shall issue any shares of Common Stock, or shall issue any Common
Stock Equivalents (as hereinafter defined), for a consideration per share less than the Conversion
Price in effect for any series of Preferred Stock immediately prior to the issuance of such
Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents, the Conversion Price of such share of such series
of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall be decreased to the
amount determined in accordance with the following formula:

Conversion Price for such Series = (Pix!) + (P2x92)
Q!+02

(For purposes of the foregoing formula:

Pl = Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance.

Qi = Number of shares of Common Stock deemed outstanding (in accordance
with subparagraph (vi) below) immediately prior to such issuance.

sd-544777 -9.

P2= Average price per share received by the Corporation upon such issuance
(determined in accordance with subparagraphs (iii) and (vi) below).

Q2 = Number of shares of Common Stock issued or sold, or deemed to have been
issued or sold (in accordance with subparagraph (vi) below) upon such
issuance.

for dilution set forth in this Section 4(d) by a vote of the holders of at least seventy-five percent
(75%) of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class and not as
separate series, and on an as-converted basis).

For purpose of any adjustment of the Conversion Price for the Preferred Stock pursuant
to this Section 4(d), the following provisions shall be applicable:

(i) “Common Stock Equivalents” means any stock or security
convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock and any right, warrant or
option to acquire Common Stock or any such convertible, exercisable or exchangeable security.

Gi) | The per share consideration for the sale or issuance of Common
Stock shall be the price per share received by the Corporation before payment of commissions,

(iii) In the case of the sale or issuance of Common Stock Equivalents,
the per share consideration shall be determined by dividing the maximum number of shares of
Common Stock issuable with respect to such Common Stock Equivalents into the aggregate
consideration received by the Corporation upon the sale or issuance of such Common Stock
Equivalents plus the minimum aggregate amount of any additional consideration receivable by
the Corporation upon the conversion or exercise of such Common Stock Equivalents. For the
purpose of this calculation, such maximum number of shares shall be assumed to be issued on
the earlier of the payment date or record date for a distribution of such Common Stock
Equivalents.

upon the issuance of the Common Stock Equivalents to which such readjustments relates. If any

8d-544777 -10-
Price for the Preferred Stock, as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to the extent
such Common Stock Equivalents have not then expired or been exercised or converted.

(v) Incase the Corporation shall declare a dividend or make any other
distribution upon any stock of the Corporation payable in Common Stock or Common Stock
Equivalents, such Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents shall be deemed to have been
issued or sold without consideration as of the earlier of the related record or payment date.

in time shall include all Shares then issuable or to become issuable pursuant to any Common

for mandatory conversion of all such shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 5. Such
notice shall be sent both by facsimile transmission (if a facsimile number has been provided and
is operational) and by first class or registered mail, postage prepaid, to each record holder of
Preferred Stock at such holder’s facsimile number and address last shown on the records of the
Corporation for the Preferred Stock. Upon receipt of such notice, each holder of shares of
Preferred Stock shall surrender his, her or its certificate or certificates for all such shares to the
Corporation at the place designated in such notice, and shall thereafter receive certificates for the
number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Section 5.
On the Mandatory Conversion Date, all rights with respect to the Preferred Stock so converted,
including the rights, if any, to receive notices and vote, will terminate, except only the rights of
the holders thereof, upon surrender of their certificate or certificates therefor, to receive

sd-544777 -14-
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which such Preferred Stock has been
converted. If so required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be
endorsed or accompanied by written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to
the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or by such holder’s attorney duly
authorized in writing. As soon as practicable after the Mandatory Conversion Date and the
surrender of the certificate or certificates for Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall cause to be
issued and delivered to such holder, or on his, her or its written order, a certificate or certificates
for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable on such conversion in accordance with
the provisions hereof and cash as provided in Section 4(b) in respect of any fraction of a share of
Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion.

(c) All certificates evidencing shares of Preferred Stock which are required to
be surrendered for conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof shall, from and after the
Mandatory Conversion Date, be deemed to have been retired and cancelled and the shares of
Preferred Stock represented thereby converted into Common Stock for all purposes,
notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender such certificates on or
prior to such date. The Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate action (without the
need for stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized Preferred Stock
accordingly.

6. Redemption Event.

(a) At anytime after the fifth anniversary of the first issuance of shares of
Series C Preferred Stock, if the Corporation shall receive a written request (an “Initial
Redemption Request”) by the holders of at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the shares of
Preferred Stock (such requesting holders of Preferred Stock, the “Initial Requesting Holders”),
the Corporation will redeem from each Requesting Holder (as defined in Section 6(c) below), at
the price per share equal to the applicable Original Issue Price, subject to appropriate adjustment
in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization
affecting such shares, plus any dividends declared or accrued but unpaid thereon (the
“Redemption Price”), all shares of Preferred Stock held by such Requesting Holder, in
accordance with the following schedule and priority:

(i) The redemption of all shares of Preferred Stock held by the
Requesting Holders shall be completed in three equal, annual payments. The first of such
payments shall be made thirty (30) days following the receipt by the Corporation of the Initial
Redemption Request (the “Initial Redemption Date”); the second of such payments shall be
made on the one year anniversary of the Initial Redemption Date; and the third of such payments
shall made on the two year anniversary of the Initial Redemption Date (each such date a
“Redemption Date”).

(ii) | The Requesting Holders holding Series C Preferred Stock shall
receive their redemption payment on such shares of Series C Preferred Stock in full prior and in
preference to any redemption payment to Requesting Holders on shares of Series A Preferred
Stock or Series B Preferred Stock. After the redemption payment in full on each Requesting
Holder’s shares of Series C Preferred Stock, the Requesting Holders holding Series A Preferred

sd-544777 -15-

Stock and Series B Preferred Stock shall receive, pari passu, their redemption payment on such
shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock.

(b) If the funds of the Corporation legally available for redemption of
Preferred Stock on any Redemption Date are insufficient to redeem all of the number of shares of
Preferred Stock required under this Section 6 to be redeemed on such date, those funds which are
legally available will be used first to redeem the shares of Series C Preferred Stock ratably
among the Requesting Holders, and second to redeem the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and
Series B Preferred Stock ratably among the Requesting Holders. At any time thereafter when
additional funds of the Corporation become legally available for the redemption of Preferred
Stock, such funds will be used, at the end of the next succeeding fiscal quarter, to redeem the
balance of the shares which the Corporation was theretofore obligated to redeem, ratably on the
basis and subject to the priority set forth in the preceding sentence and Section 6(a)(ii).

{c) The Corporation shall provide notice of its receipt of an Initial
Redemption Request, specifying the time, manner and place of redemption and the Redemption
Price (a “Redemption Notice”), by first class or registered mail, postage prepaid, to each holder
of record of the same series of Preferred Stock as the Initial Requesting Holders, at the address
for such holders last shown on the records of the transfer agent therefor (or the records of the
Corporation, if it serves as its own transfer agent), not less than twenty (20) days prior to the
Initial Redemption Date. Each holder of record of the same series of Preferred Stock as the
Initial Requesting Holders may elect to become, together with each of the Initial Requesting
Holders, one of the “Requesting Holders” on the Initial Redemption Date by so indicating in a
written notice mailed to the Corporation, by first class or registered mail, postage prepaid, at
least ten (10) days prior to the Initial Redemption Date. Except as provided in Section 6(b)
above, each Requesting Holder shall surrender to the Corporation on the applicable Redemption
Date the certificate(s) representing the shares to be redeemed on such date, in the manner and at
the place designated in the Redemption Notice. Thereupon, the Redemption Price shall be paid
to the order of each such Requesting Holder and each certificate surrendered for redemption shall
be canceled. In the case less than all Preferred Stock represented by any certificate is redeemed
on any Redemption Date, a new certificate will be issued representing the unredeemed Preferred
Stock without cost to the holder thereof.

(d) | Unless there shall have been a default in payment of the applicable
Redemption Price, no share of Preferred Stock designated for redemption on a specific
Redemption Date shall be entitled to any dividends declared after such Redemption Date, and on
such Redemption Date all rights of the holder of such share as a stockholder of the Corporation
by reason of the ownership of such share will cease, except the right to receive the applicable
Redemption Price of such share, without interest, upon presentation and surrender of the
certificate representing such share, and such share will not from and after such Redemption Date
be deemed to be outstanding.

(e) | Upon receipt by the Corporation of the Initial Redemption Request, the

Corporation shall not declare or pay any dividend until the redemption of all shares of the
Preferred Stock held by the Requesting Holders has been completed in full.

any twelve (12) month period;

any partially owned subsidiaries, joint ventures, or partnerships;

(p) Enter into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements or use any of the

(q) Enter into any transaction with any (A) officer or director of the
Corporation, or (B) employee or other affiliate of the Corporation, other than, in the case of (B),

length transaction.

8. Substantial Transactions Requiring Consent of Each Series of Preferred Stock.
For so long as any shares of a series of Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the Corporation shall

entitled to be voted at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon are present and voted

Section. Such right to indemnification and advancement of expenses shall continue as to a
person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit
of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. The indemnification and
advancement of expenses provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights
to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any
Bylaw, agreement, vote or stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

EIGHTH: To the fullest extent that the General Corporation Law, as it exists on the date
