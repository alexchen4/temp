which any shares of Series E Preferred Stock were first issued (the “Purchase Date”), any
Additional Stock (as defined below) without consideration or for a consideration per share less
than the Original Series C Issue Price in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such
Additional Stock, the Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock other than the Series Z
Preferred Stock shall forthwith (except as otherwise provided in this clause (i)) be adjusted to a
price determined by multiplying the applicable Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred
Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, and Series E
Preferred Stock by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares of Common
Stock that the aggregate consideration received by the corporation for such issuance would
purchase at the Conversion Price for each respective series of Preferred Stock in effect
immediately prior to such issuance; and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares
of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares of
such Additional Stock.

For purposes of this Section 3(d)(i)(A), all shares of the
Company’s Common Stock issuable upon exercise of all outstanding options, rights or warrants
and upon conversion of all outstanding convertible securities and Preferred Stock of the
Company shall be deemed to be outstanding, and immediately after any Additional Stock is
deemed issued pursuant to Section 3(d)(i)(E), such shares of Additional Stock shall be deemed to
be outstanding.

(B) No adjustment of the Conversion Price for the Series A
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, or
Series E Preferred Stock shall be made in an amount less than one cent ($0.01) per share,
provided that any adjustments which are not required to be made by reason of this sentence shall
be carried forward and shall be either taken into account in any subsequent adjustment made
prior to three (3) years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried
forward, or shall be made at the end of three (3) years from the date of the event giving rise to
the adjustment being carried forward. Except to the limited extent provided for in subsections
3(d)(G)(E)(3) and 3(d)(i)(E)(4), no adjustment of such Conversion Price pursuant to this
subsection 3(d)(i) shall have the effect of increasing such Conversion Price above the
Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment.

(C) Inthe case of the issuance of Common Stock for cash, the
consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting any
reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by this
corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

(D) Inthe case of the issuance of the Common Stock fora
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be
deemed to be the fair value thereof as determined by the Board including the affirmative vote of
a majority of the Preferred Directors (as defined in Article V) irrespective of any accounting
