for purposes of determining the amount cach holder of shares of any series of Preferred Stock is
entitled to receive with respect to this Subsection A.3, the holder of each share of such series of
Preferred Stock shall be treated as if such holder had converted such holder’s shares of such series of
Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock immediately prior to the Liquidation Bvent if, as a

Consent”), In addition, each share of Series C Preferred shall be automatically converted into

{c) Mechanics of Conversion,

(i) No fractional shares of Common Stock shali be issued upon
conversion of Preferred Stock, In liev of any fractional share to which a holder would otherwise be
entitled (determined on a certificate by certificate basis), the Corporation shall pay cash equal to
such fraction multiplied by the then fair value of a share of Common Stock as determined in
accordance with Section 407 of the General Corporation Law of California,

(ii) Before any holder of Preferred Stock shal be entitled to
convert the same into full shares of Common Stock, he or she shall surrender the certificate or
certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for the
Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the Corporation at such office that he or she elects to
convert the sane. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such
office to such holder of Preferred Stock, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of
Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid and a check payable to the holder
in the atnount of any cash amounts payable as the result of a conversion into fractional shares of
Common Stock. Upon conyersion of only a portion of the number of shares of Preferred Stock
represented by a certificate surrendered for conversion, the Corporation shall issue and deliver to or
upon the written order of the holder of the certificate so surrendered for conversion, at the expense of
the Corporation, a new certificate covering the number of shares of Preferred Stock representing the
unconverted portion of the certificate so surrendered.

(ii) Such conversion shall not terminate the rights of the holders of
Preferred Stock or Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock to receive
dividends which have been declared with respeot to the Preferred Stock as ofa record date prior to
the date of conversion. Except as set forth in Subsection A.(4)(b) above, such conversion shall be
deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender
of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the

7604845_7.docx ~7-
80775080

shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the
record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date, Ifthe conversion is in
connection with an underwritten offer of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act, the
conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned
upon the closing with the underwriter of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering, in which
event the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of the
Preferred Stock shal! not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior
to the closing of such sale of securities.
