merger or consolidation continue to hold at least a majority of the voting power of the capital
stock of the surviving entity in substantially the same proportions as immediately prior to such
merger or consolidation), (ii) the closing of a sale, transfer or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, (iii) the exclusive license of all or substantially
all of the Corporation’s intellectual property, (iv) the closing of the transfer (whether by merger,
consolidation or otherwise) of the Corporation’s capital stock if, after such closing, a person or
group of affiliated persons would hold fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding voting
stock of the Corporation (or the surviving or acquiring entity) or (v) any liquidation, dissolution
or winding up of the Corporation or its assets; provided, however, that a bona fide institutional
equity financing transaction in which the Corporation issues shares of its capital stock shall not
be treated as a Liquidation Event; and, further provided, that a transaction shall not constitute a
Liquidation Event if its sole purpose is to change the Corporation’s state of incorporation or to
create a holding company that will be owned in substantially the same proportions by the persons
who held the Corporation’s capital stock immediately prior to such transaction. All
consideration payable to the stockholders of the Corporation in connection with any Liquidation
Event, or all consideration payable to the Corporation and distributable to its stockholders,

the preferences and priorities set forth in Sections A.4(a) through (c) above. The Corporation
shall promptly provide to the holders of shares of Preferred Stock such information concerning
the terms of any Liquidation Event and the value of the assets of the Corporation as may
reasonably be requested by the holders of Preferred Stock. If applicable, the Corporation shall
cause the definitive agreement relating to such Liquidation Event to provide for a rate at which
the shares of capital stock of the Corporation are converted into or exchanged for cash, new
securities or other property, or redeemed on a basis which gives effect to the provisions of this
Section A.4.

noncash consideration to be delivered to the holders of the Preferred Stock in connection with
any transaction to which this Section A.4 is applicable, the following shall apply:

(i) If any such securities are traded on a nationally recognized
securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system, the value shall be deemed to be the average
of the closing prices of such securities on such exchange or system over the thirty (30) day period
ending three (3) trading days prior to the closing of the Liquidation Event;

(ii) ‘If any such securities are traded over-the-counter, the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sales prices (whichever is applicable) of such
securities over the thirty (30) day period ending three (3) business days prior to the closing of the
Liquidation Event; and

(iii) If there is no active public market for such securities, the value
shall be the fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Corporation and the holders
of not less than two-thirds (2/3) of the then outstanding voting power (“‘Two-Thirds Interest’) of
the Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class and on an as-converted basis) and a Two-
Thirds Interest of the Series C Preferred Stock (voting as a separate class and on as as-converted
basis); provided, that if the Corporation and the holders of a Two-Thirds Interest of the Preferred
Stock (voting together as a single class and on an as-converted basis) and the holders of a
Two-Thirds Interest of the Series C Preferred Stock (voting as a separate class and on an
as-converted basis) are unable to reach agreement, then by independent appraisal by a mutually
agreed to investment banker, the fees of which shall be paid by the Corporation.

5. Redemption.

(a) Optional Redemption: Time Based Redemptions. At any time on or after
April 3, 2012, but within thirty (30) days after the date set forth in a written request received by
the Corporation from the holders of not less than a Two-Thirds Interest of the Preferred Stock
(voting together as a single class and on an as-converted basis) and a Two-Thirds Interest of the
Series C Preferred Stock (voting as a separate class and on as as-converted basis), the
Corporation shall, to the extent it may lawfully do so, redeem in three (3) annual installments
(each payment date being referred to herein as a “Preferred Stock Redemption Date’) the
number of then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock set forth in such notice (the “Redemption
Shares’) by paying in cash therefor a sum per share equal to the applicable Preferred Stock
Redemption Price (as defined below). The number of shares of each series of Preferred Stock
that the Corporation shall be required to redeem on any one Redemption Date shall be equal to
the amount determined by dividing (i) the aggregate number of Redemption Share for each series
of Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Redemption Date by (ii) the number of
remaining Redemption Dates (including the Redemption Date to which such calculation applies).
Any redemption of a series of Preferred Stock effected pursuant to this Section A.5 shall be made
on a pro rata basis among the holders of such series of Preferred Stock in proportion to the
aggregate Redemption Price of each such holder of Preferred Stock would otherwise be entitled
to receive on the applicable Redemption Date.

(b) Redemption Price. The price for each share of Preferred Stock redeemed
pursuant to this Section A.5 shall be an amount equal to the Applicable Original Issue Price for
such shares of Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, combinations,
subdivisions, recapitalizations or the like) plus all declared and unpaid dividends thereon (the
“Preferred Stock Redemption Price’).

(c) Notice. At least fifteen (15) but not more than thirty (30) days prior to
each Preferred Stock Redemption Date, written notice shall be mailed by the Corporation, first
class postage prepaid, to each holder of record (at the close of business on the business day next

6
preceding the day on which notice is given) of the Preferred Stock, the address last shown on the
records of the Corporation for such holder, notifying such holder of the redemption to be
effected, specifying the number and series of shares to be redeemed from such holder, the
Preferred Stock Redemption Date, the applicable Preferred Stock Redemption Price for each
series of Preferred Stock, the place at which payment may be obtained and calling upon such
holder to surrender to the Corporation, in the manner and at the place designated, such holder’s
certificate or certificates representing the shares to be redeemed (the ‘‘Redemption Notice’’).

(d) Unredeemed Preferred Stock. If any shares of Preferred Stock are not
redeemed on a Preferred Stock Redemption Date for any reason, including but not limited to the
Corporation's failure to pay the applicable Preferred Stock Redemption Price as of such
Preferred Stock Redemption Date, then all such unredeemed shares of Preferred Stock shall
remain outstanding and shall be entitled to all the rights and preferences provided herein.

(e) Insufficient Funds. If the funds of the Corporation legally available to
redeem shares of Preferred Stock on a Preferred Stock Redemption Date are insufficient to
redeem the total number of such shares required to be redeemed on such Preferred Stock
Redemption Date, the Corporation shall (i) take any action necessary or appropriate, to the extent
reasonably within its control, to remove promptly any impediments to its ability to redeem the
total number of shares of Preferred Stock required to be so redeemed, including, without
limitation, (A) to the extent permissible under applicable law, reducing the stated capital of the
Corporation or causing a revaluation of the assets of the Corporation under Section 154 of the
Delaware General Corporation Law to create sufficient surplus to make such redemption and (ii)
in any event, use any funds that are legally available to redeem the maximum possible number of
such shares from the holders of such shares to be redeemed in proportion to the respective
number of such shares that otherwise would have been redeemed if all such shares had been
redeemed in full. At any time thereafter when additional funds of the Corporation are legally
available to redeem such shares of Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall immediately use such
funds to redeem the balance of the shares that the Corporation became obligated to redeem on
such Preferred Stock Redemption Date (but which it has not yet redeemed) at the applicable
Preferred Stock Redemption Price.

(f) Dividend After Redemption Date. In the event that shares of Preferred
Stock required to be redeemed are not redeemed and continue to be outstanding, such shares
shall continue to be entitled to dividends and interest thereon when and as declared by the Board
of Directors as provided in Section A.3 until the date on which the Corporation actually redeems
such shares.

(g) Surrender of Certificates. Each holder of shares of Preferred Stock to be
redeemed shall surrender the certificate or certificates representing such shares to the Corporation
to the place specified in the Redemption Notice, duly assigned or endorsed for transfer to the
Corporation (or accompanied by duly executed stock powers relating thereto), or, in the event the
certificate or certificates are lost, stolen or missing, shall deliver an affidavit of loss, to the place
specified in the Redemption Notice, and each surrendered certificate shall be canceled and retired
and the Corporation shall thereafter make payment of the applicable Preferred Stock Redemption
Price by certified check or wire transfer; provided, however, that if the Corporation has
insufficient funds legally available to redeem all shares of Preferred Stock required to be
redeemed, each such holder shall, in addition to receiving the payment of the portion of the
aggregate Preferred Stock Redemption Price that the Corporation is not legally prohibited from
paying to such holder by certified check or wire transfer, receive a new stock certificate for those
shares of Preferred Stock not so redeemed.

6. Conversion. The holders of Preferred Stock shall have the following conversion
rights:

(a) Voluntary Conversion. Any holder of shares of Preferred Stock may
convert such shares into Common Stock at any time after the date of issuance of such shares of
Preferred Stock upon the written election of such holder and without payment of any additional
consideration, and each outstanding share of Preferred Stock held by such holder shall be
converted into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is
determined by dividing (i) the applicable Original Issue Price by (ii) the Applicable Conversion
Price at the time in effect for such share of Preferred Stock (the ‘Conversion Rate’). The initial
“Applicable Conversion Price” per share for shares of each series of Preferred Stock shall be the
applicable Original Issue Price with respect to such series, subject to adjustment as set forth in
Section A.7. Any election by a holder of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section A.6(a) shall be
made by written notice to the Corporation, and such notice may be given at any time after the
date of original issuance of such share and through and including the day which is five (5) days
prior to the closing of any Liquidation Event; provided, however, that no notice may be given
with respect to a share of Preferred Stock on the day prior to, or the day of, any Preferred Stock
Redemption Date on which such share will be redeemed.

(b) Automatic Conversion.

(i) Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted,
without the payment of any additional consideration, into fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Common Stock at the applicable Conversion Rate upon the Corporation’s first sale of its
Common Stock in a firm commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act’’),
provided that such registration statement covers the offer and sale of Common Stock of which
the aggregate net proceeds to the Corporation are at least $40,000,000 and the price per share is
at least $7.23 (appropriately adjusted for any stock split, combination, subdivision,
reorganization, recapitalizations, stock dividend, or the like) (a “QPO”). If a closing of a QPO
occurs, all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have been converted into
shares of Common Stock immediately prior to such closing.

(ii) ~~ Prior to a QPO. upon the written election of the holders of a
Majority Interest (as defined in Section A.8) of the Preferred Stock voting as a single class on an
as-converted basis (a “Conversion Election”), and without the payment of any additional
consideration, all of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted into fully paid
and nonassessable shares of Common Stock at the Applicable Conversion Rate for each series of
Preferred Stock; provided, that no shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall be converted into
shares of Common Stock unless the Conversion Election has been signed by the holders of at
least a Two-Thirds Interest of the Series C Preferred Stock (as a separate class and on an as-
converted basis). Any Conversion Election made pursuant to this Section A.6(b)(ii) shall (a) be
made by written notice to the Corporation and the other holders of Preferred Stock, and such
notice may be given at any time after the date on which shares of Series C Preferred Stock are
first issued (the “Closing Date’’) through and including the date which is five (5) days prior to the

8
closing of any Liquidation Event, and (b) bind all holders of Preferred Stock; provided, that such
Conversion Election shall not bind the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock unless such
Conversion Election has been signed by the holders of at least a Two-Thirds Interest of the
Series C Preferred Stock (as a separate class and on an as-converted basis).

(c) Procedure for Conversion.

(i) Voluntary Conversion. Upon clection to convert pursuant to
Section A.6(a), the relevant holder of Preferred Stock shall surrender the certificate or certificates
representing the Preferred Stock being converted to the Corporation, duly assigned or endorsed
for transfer to the Corporation (or accompanied by duly executed stock powers relating thereto)
or shall deliver an affidavit of loss to the Corporation, at its principal executive office or such
other place as the Corporation may from time to time designate by notice to the holders of the
Preferred Stock. Upon surrender of such certificate(s) or delivery of an affidavit of loss, the
Corporation shall issue and send by hand delivery, by courier or by first class mail (postage
prepaid) to the holder thereof or to such holder's designee, at the address designated by such
holder, certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be
entitled upon conversion. The issuance of certificates for Common Stock upon conversion of
Preferred Stock shall be deemed effective as of the date of surrender of such Preferred Stock
certificates or delivery of such affidavit of loss and will be made without charge to the holders of
such shares for any issuance tax in respect thereof or other costs incurred by the Corporation in
connection with such conversion and the related issuance of such stock.

(ii) | Automatic Conversion. As of the closing of a QPO or upon a
Conversion Election (the “Automatic Conversion Date’’), all outstanding shares of Preferred
Stock or all outstanding shares of Junior Preferred Stock, as the case may be (the “Conversion
Shares”), shall be converted into shares of Common Stock without any further action by the
holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates representing such Conversion Shares
are surrendered to the Corporation. On the Automatic Conversion Date, all rights with respect to
the Conversion Shares so converted shall terminate. except any of the rights of the holders
thereof upon surrender of their certificate or certificates therefor or delivery of an affidavit of loss
thereof to receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which such
Conversion Shares have been converted. If so required by the Corporation, certificates
surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed, or accompanied by a written instrument or
instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered
holder or by his. her or its attorney duly authorized in writing. Upon surrender of such
certificates or affidavit of loss, the Corporation shall issue and deliver to such holder, promptly
(and in the event of an automatic conversion in connection with a QPO in such time as is
sufficient to enable such holder to participate in such QPO) at such office and in its name as
shown on such surrendered certificate or certificates, a certificate or certificates for the number of
shares of Common Stock into which the Conversion Shares surrendered are convertible on the
Automatic Conversion Date.

(d) _—_ Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at
all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock,
solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of Preferred Stock, such number
of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock is insufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate action as may be necessary to increase
the number of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as
shall be sufficient for such purpose, and to reserve the appropriate number of shares of Common
Stock for issuance upon such conversion.

(e) No Closing of Transfer Books. The Corporation shall not close its books
against the transfer of shares of Preferred Stock in any manner that would interfere with the
timely conversion of any shares of Preferred Stock.

7. Adjustments.

(a) Adjustments to the Applicable Conversion Price. Except as provided in
Section A.7(b) and except in the case of an event described in Section A.7(c), if and whenever
after the Closing Date the Corporation shall issue or sell, or is, in accordance with this Section
A.7(a), deemed to have issued or sold, any shares of Common Stock without consideration or for
a consideration per share (determined as provided in Section A.7(a)(vi)) less than the Applicable
Conversion Price for a series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to the time of such
issuance or sale, then, upon such issuance or sale (or deemed issuance or sale), the Applicable
Conversion Price with respect to such series of Preferred Stock shall be reduced to the price
determined by dividing (i) an amount equal to the sum of (A) the total number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance or sale (or deemed issuance or
sale) (including, for this purpose, all shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise or
conversion of any Options (as defined below) or Convertible Securities (as defined below)
outstanding as of the date of such issuance or sale (or deemed issuance or sale)) multiplied by the
then existing Applicable Conversion Price and (B) the consideration, if any, received by the
Corporation upon such issuance or sale (or deemed issuance or sale) by (ii) the total number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance or sale (or deemed
issuance or sale) (including, for this purpose, all shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise
or conversion of Options or Convertible Securities outstanding as of the date of such issuance or
sale (or deemed issuance or sale)) plus the number of shares of Common Stock so issued or sold
(or so deemed issued or sold).

For purposes of this Section A.7(a), the following shall also be applicable:

(i) Issuance of Rights or Options. If the Corporation shall, at any time
after the Closing Date, in any manner grant (whether directly or by assumption in a merger or
otherwise), any warrants or other rights to subscribe for or to purchase, or any options for the
purchase of, Common Stock or any stock or security convertible into or exchangeable for
Common Stock (such warrants, rights or options being called “Options” and such convertible or
exchangeable stock or securities being called “Convertible Securities”), in each case for no
consideration or for consideration per share (determined as provided in this paragraph and in
Section A.7(a)(vi)) less than the Applicable Conversion Price for a series of Preferred Stock,
whether or not such Options or the right to convert or exchange any such Convertible Securities
are immediately exercisable, then the total maximum number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon the exercise of such Options. or upon conversion or exchange of the total
maximum amount of such Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of such Options, shall
be deemed to have been issued as of the date of granting of such Options (and thereafter shall be
deemed to be outstanding), at a price per share equal to the amount determined by dividing (A)

10
the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Corporation as consideration for the
granting of such Options, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration
payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of all such Options, plus, in the case of such
Options which relate to Convertible Securities, the minimum aggregate amount of additional
consideration, if any, payable upon the issue or sale of such Convertible Securities and upon the
conversion or exchange thereof, by (B) the total maximum number of shares of Common Stock
deemed to have been so issued. Except as otherwise provided in Section A.7(a)(iii), no further
adjustment of the Applicable Conversion Price with respect to such series of Preferred Stock
shall be made upon the actual issuance of such Common Stock or of such Convertible Securities
upon exercise of such Options or upon the actual issuance of such Common Stock upon
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities.

(ii) Issuance of Convertible Securities. If the Corporation shall, at any
time after the Closing Date, in any manner issue or sell any Convertible Securities for no
consideration or for consideration per share (determined as provided in this paragraph and in
Section A.7(a)(vi)) less than the Applicable Conversion Price for a series of Preferred Stock,
whether or not the rights to exchange or convert any such Convertible Securities are immediately
exercisable, then the total maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion or exchange of al] such Convertible Securities shall be deemed to have been issued as
of the date of the issuance or sale of such Convertible Securities (and thereafter shall be deemed
to be outstanding), at a price per share equal to the amount determined by dividing (A) the total
amount, if any, received or receivable by the Corporation as consideration for the issuance or sale
of such Convertible Securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration,
if any, payable to the Corporation upon the conversion or exchange thereof, by (B) the total
maximum number of shares of Common Stock deemed to have been so issued; provided that
(1) except as otherwise provided in Section A.7(a)(iii), no further adjustment of the Applicable
Conversion Price with respect to such series of Preferred stock shall be made upon the actual
issuance of such Common Stock upon conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities
and (2) if any such issuance or sale of such Convertible Securities is made upon exercise of any
Options to purchase any such Convertible Securities, no further adjustment of the Applicable
Conversion Price shall be made by reason of such issue or sale.

(iii) | Change in Option Price or Conversion Rate. If there shall occur a
change in (A) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable in connection with any
Option referred to in Section A.7(a)(i) or any Convertible Securities referred to in Section
A.7(a)(i) or (it), (B) the minimum aggregate purchase price (whether as consideration for the
grant, consideration paid at the time of exercise or other consideration paid to the Corporation in
comnection with an Option) provided for in any Option referred to in Section A.7(a)(i), (C) the
minimum additional consideration, if any, payable upon the conversion or exchange of any
Convertible Securities referred to in Section A.7(a)(i) or (ii) or (D) the rate at which Convertible
Securities referred to in Section A.7(a)(i) or (ii) are convertible into or exchangeable for
Common Stock (in each case, other than an event described in Section A.7(b)), then the
Applicable Conversion Price with respect to each series of Preferred Stock in effect at the time of
such event shall be readjusted to the Applicable Conversion Price for each scries of Preferred
Stock that would have been in effect at such time had such Options or Convertible Securities that
are still outstanding provided for such changed maximum number of shares, purchase price,
additional consideration or conversion rate, as the case may be, at the time initially granted,
issued or sold; and on the termination of any such Option or any such right to convert or

11
exchange such Convertible Securities, the Applicable Conversion Price with respect to each
series of Preferred Stock then in effect hereunder shall be increased to the Applicable Conversion
Price for each such series of Preferred Stock that would have been in effect at the time of such
termination had such Option or Convertible Securities, to the extent outstanding immediately
prior to such termination (i.e., to the extent that fewer than the number of shares of Common
Stock deemed to have been issued in connection with such Option or Convertible Securities were
actually issued), never been issued.

(iv) Stock Dividends. If the Corporation shall declare a dividend or
make any other distribution upon any stock of the Corporation payable in Common Stock,
Options or Convertible Securities, any Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities, as the
case may be, issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution shall be deemed to have been
issued or sold without consideration, and the Applicable Conversion Price with respect to each
series of Preferred Stock will be adjusted pursuant to this Section A.7(a)(iv); provided that no
adjustment shall be made to the Applicable Conversion Price for a series of Preferred Stock if the
holders of such series of Preferred Stock are entitled to, and do, receive such dividend or
distribution in accordance with Section A.3; and provided further that if any adjustment is made
to the Applicable Conversion Price for a series of Preferred Stock as a result of the declaration of
a dividend and such dividend is not effected, then the Applicable Conversion Price for such
series of Preferred Stock shall be appropriately readjusted.

(v) Other Dividends and Distributions. In the event the Corporation at
any time or from time to time after the Closing Date shall make or issue, or fix a record date for
the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other
distribution payable in securities or other property of the Corporation other than shares of
Common Stock, then and in each such event provision shall be made so that the holders of the
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall receive upon conversion thereof, in addition to the
number of shares of Common Stock receivable thereupon, the amount of such other securities of
the Corporation or the value of such other property that they would have received had the
Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock immediately prior to the record date of such
event and had such holders thereafter, during the period from the record date of such event to and
including the conversion date, retained such securities or other property receivable by them
during such period giving application to all adjustments called for during such period under this
Section A.7 with respect to the rights of the holders of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock;
provided, however, that no such adjustment shall be made if the holders of Preferred Stock
simultaneously receive a dividend or other distribution of such securities or other property in an
amount equal to the amount of such securities or other property as they would have received if all

outstanding shares of Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock immediately prior
to the record date of such event.

(vi) Consideration for Stock. In case any shares of Common Stock
shall be issued or sold, or deemed issued or sold, for cash. the consideration received therefor
shall be deemed to be the amount received or to be received by the Corporation therefor before
deducting any reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by
the Corporation in connection with such issuance or sale (or deemed issuance or sale)
(determined with respect to deemed issuances and sales in connection with Options and
Convertible Securities in accordance with clause (A) of Section A.7(a)(i) or (ii), as appropriate).
In case any shares of Common Stock shall be issued or sold, or deemed issued or sold, for a

12
consideration other than cash, the amount of the consideration other than cash received by the
Corporation shall be deemed to be the fair value of such consideration received or to be received
by the Corporation (determined with respect to deemed issuances and sales in connection with
Options and Convertible Securities in accordance with clause (A) of Section A.7(a)(i) or (ii), as
appropriate) as determined by the Board of Directors. In case any Options shall be issued in
connection with the issue and sale of other securities of the Corporation, together comprising one
integral transaction in which no specific consideration is allocated to such Options by the parties
thereto, such Options shall be deemed to have been issued for such consideration as determined
by the Board of Directors.

(vii) Record Date. In case the Corporation shall take a record of the
holders of its Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them (A) to receive a dividend or other
distribution payable in Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities or (B) to subscribe for
or purchase Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities, then such record date shall be
deemed to be the date of the issuance or sale of the shares of Common Stock deemed to have
been issued or sold upon the declaration of such dividend or the making of such other
distribution or the date of the granting of such right of subscription or purchase, as the case may
be.

(viii) Treasury Shares. The number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding at any given time shall not include shares owned or held by or for the account of the
Corporation; provided that the disposition of any such shares shall be considered an issuance or
sale of Common Stock for the purpose of this Section A.7.

(b) Certain Issues of Common Stock Excepted. Anything herein to the
contrary notwithstanding, the Corporation shall not be required to make any adjustment of the
Applicable Conversion Price in the case of the issuance from and after the Closing Date of (in
each case, “Excluded Shares’): (i) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable upon conversion
of shares of Preferred Stock; (ii) shares of Common Stock issuable or issued to directors,
officers, employees, consultants, or advisors or vendors (if in transactions with non-financing
purposes) of the Corporation pursuant to a stock option, stock bonus, stock purchase or restricted
stock plan or agreement, if such option, bonus, plan or agreement is approved by the Board of
Directors (‘Option Shares’), (iii) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable in a QPO, (iv)
Common Stock issued or deemed issued pursuant to a bona fide business acquisition of or by the
Corporation whether by merger, consolidation, combination, purchase of all or substantially all
of the assets of the Corporation or exclusive license of all or substantially all of the Corporation’s
intellectual property or sale or exchange of stock or otherwise, (v) Common Stock issued or
deemed issued in connection with any equipment leasing arrangement or debt financing from a
bank or similar financial institution for other than equity financing purposes approved
unanimously by the Board of Directors, (vi) Common Stock issued or deemed issued in exchange
for property (real or personal) or services approved unanimously by the Board of Directors and at
fair market value as determined unanimously by the Board of Directors, (vii) Common Stock
issued or issuable as a dividend or distribution on the Preferred Stock pursuant to Section A.3,
(viii) shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to a transaction described in Section A.7(c), (ix)
shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to options or warrants outstanding as of the Closing
Date, or (x) shares of Common Stock issued or deemed issued as a result of a decrease in the

Applicable Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock resulting from the operation of
Section A.7.

13
(c) Subdivision or Combination of Common Stock. In case the Corporation
shall at any time after the Closing Date subdivide its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a
greater number of shares (by any stock split, stock dividend or otherwise) without a
corresponding subdivision of the Preferred Stock, the Applicable Conversion Price for each
series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall be proportionately
reduced, and, conversely, in case the Corporation shall at any time after the Closing Date
combine its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares (by any
reverse stock split or otherwise) without a corresponding combination of the Preferred Stock. the
Applicable Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to
such combination shall be proportionately increased. In the case of any such subdivision, no
further adjustment shall be made pursuant to Section A.7(a)(iv) by reason thereof.

(d) Reorganization or Reclassification. If any capital reorganization or
reclassification of the capital stock of the Corporation shall be effected in such a way that holders
of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive stock, securities or assets with respect to or in
exchange for Common Stock, then, as a condition of such reorganization or reclassification,
lawful and adequate provisions shall be made whereby each holder of a share or shares of
Preferred Stock shal] thereupon have the right to receive, upon the basis and upon the terms and
conditions specified herein and in lieu of the shares of Common Stock immediately theretofore
receivable upon the conversion of such share or shares of Preferred Stock, as the case may be,
such shares of stock, securities or assets as may be issued or payable with respect to or in
exchange for a number of outstanding shares of such Common Stock equal to the number of
shares of such Common Stock immediately theretofore receivable upon such conversion had
such reorganization or reclassification not taken place, and in any such case appropriate
provisions shall be made with respect to the rights and interests of such holder to the end that the
provisions hereof (including, without limitation, provisions for adjustments of the Applicable
Conversion Price for such holders shares of Preferred Stock) shall thereafter be applicable, as
nearly as may be, in relation to any shares of stock, securities or assets thereafter deliverable
upon the exercise of such conversion rights.

(e) Liquidation Events. Upon the election of a Two-Thirds Interest of the
Preferred Stock, including a Two-Thirds Interest of the Series C Preferred Stock, made in
connection with any Liquidation Event, the liquidation provisions of Sections A.4(a) and (b)
shall not apply and each share of Preferred Stock shall remain outstanding and shall thereafter be
convertible (or shall be converted into a security which shall be convertible) into the kind and
amount of securities or other property to which a holder of the number of shares of Common
Stock of the Corporation deliverable upon conversion of such share of Preferred Stock would
have been entitled upon such Liquidation Event; and, in such case, appropriate adjustment (as
determined by the Board of Directors) shall be made in the application of the provisions of
Section A.7 set forth with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the holders of the
Preferred Stock, to the end that the provisions set forth in Section A.7 (including provisions with
respect to changes in and other adjustments of the Applicable Conversion Price) shall thereafter
be applicable, as nearly as possible, in relation to any securities or other property thereafter
deliverable upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock. Any election pursuant to and in
accordance with this Section A.7(e) shall be made by written notice to the Corporation and the
other holders of Preferred Stock at least five (5) days prior to the closing of the Liquidation
Event. Upon any election pursuant to and in accordance with this Section A.7(e), all holders of
Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have elected to so participate in such Liquidation Event in the

14
manner provided in this Section A.7(e) and such election shall bind all holders of Preferred
Stock.

respect to any criminal action or proceedings, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her
conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, upon a plea of nolo contendere or

officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such director or
officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article or otherwise. Such indemnification
and advancement of expenses shall be in addition to any other rights to which those seeking
indemnification and advancement of expenses may be entitled under any law, Bylaw, agreement,
vote of stockholders, or otherwise.

such liability under applicable law.

changes in applicable law shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be prospective only,
and shall not adversely affect any right to indemnification or advancement of expenses of a
director or officer of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or amendment. In

the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or any other
applicable law and all amendments to such laws as hereafter enacted from time to time.
