series. The rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions granted to and imposed on the Series
A Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred Stock”), which series shall consist of One
Million Eight Hundred Thirty Eight Thousand Thirteen (1,838,013) shares and the Series B
Convertible Preferred Stock (‘Series B Preferred Stock”), which series shall consist of Three
Million Six Hundred Fourteen Thousand Four Hundred Fifty Eight (3,614,458), are as set forth
below in this Article [V(B). The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock shall together be referred to herein as the “Preferred Stock”.

1. Dividend Provisions.

(a) The holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred
Stock shall be entitled to receive dividends (the “Fixed Dividends”), out of any assets legally
available therefor, payable at a per annum rate equal to eight percent (8%) (the “Dividend Rate”)
of the Series A Original Issue Price (as hereafter defined) and the Series B Original Issue Price
(as hereafter defined), respectively, calculated from the date of issuance (the “Accrual Date”).
For purposes of this Certificate of Incorporation, the Series A Original Issue Price and the Series
B Original Issue Price will each be $0.83 per share, as adjusted for any stock splits, stock
dividends, recapitalizations or the like occurring after the Second Amendment Date (as hereafter
defined) with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock or the Series B Preferred Stock,
respectively. The accrued Fixed Dividends on shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be
payable in cash when and if declared by the Board or Directors if and only if all accrued Fixed
Dividends have been paid to the holders of Series B Preferred Stock. Payment of accrued Fixed
Dividends on shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be payable in cash when and if declared by
the Board or Directors. Accrued Fixed Dividends on any shares of Series A Preferred Stock or
Series B Preferred Stock shall be cancelled upon conversion of such shares. Any dividends
payable by the Corporation in excess of the Fixed Dividends (‘Additional Dividends”) shall (i)
first be paid to the holders of Scries B Preferred Stock until such holders have received aggregate
Additional Dividends per share of Series B Preferred Stock that are equal to the Series B
Original Issue Price, (ii) then to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock until such holders have
received aggregate Additional Dividends per share of Series A Preferred Stock that are equal to
the Series A Original Issue Price, and (iii) thereafter to the holders of Common Stock, Series A
Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, allocated among such holders on a pro rata basis,
based upon the number of shares of Common Stock held by each assuming the full conversion of
all shares of Preferred Stock. The dividends will be cumulative from the applicable Accrual
Date, and will accrue on a day to day basis from the applicable Accrual Date based, whether or
not earned or declared.

(b) The Board will fix a record date for the determination of the holders of
Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend
declared thereon, which record date will not be more than forty-five (45) days prior to the date
fixed for payment of such dividends. Accrued Fixed Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock
or Series B Preferred Stock which are not declared and paid will compound quarterly on each
Dividend Compounding Date for each such Series at the Dividend Rate. For purposes of this
Certificate of Incorporation, the “Dividend Compounding Date” means January 1, 2005, and the
first day of each April, July, October and January thereafter for the Series A Preferred Stock and
October 1, 2006 and each January, April, July and October thereafter for the Series B Preferred
Stock.

{c) Unless all accrued Fixed Dividends (whether or not declared) on each
share of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock are paid, and the holders of each
such share of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock have received aggregate
Additional Dividends per share of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock which
are equal to the Original Issue Price for each such share: (i) no dividends or other distributions
(other than a dividend or distribution payable solely in Common Stock) may be declared, made
or paid on any shares of Common Stock; (ii) no shares of Common Stock may be repurchased,
exchanged, redeemed or otherwise acquired for any consideration by the Corporation, any
subsidiary of the Corporation or any entity which the Corporation owns or controls (whether
directly or indirectly), provided, however, that this restriction shall not apply to the repurchase of
shares of Common Stock from employees, officers, directors, consultants or other persons
performing services for the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation pursuant to
agreements under which the Corporation or such subsidiary has the option to repurchase such
shares at cost upon the occurrence of certain events, such as the termination of employment; and
(iii) no funds may be set apart or reserved with respect to any of the actions described in clauses

(i) or (ii).

(d) In the event the Corporation shall declare a distribution payable in
securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by the Corporation or other persons,
assets (excluding cash dividends pursuant to this Section 1) or options or rights not referred to in
subsection 4(c)(i), then, in each such case the property so distributed shall be valued for purposes
of this Section 1 at its then fair market value per share as determined by both the Corporation and
the vote or written consent of the holders of more than fifty percent (50%) of the then
outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, voting as a
single class (the “Required Majority”), or, if the Corporation and the Required Majority cannot
agree on the fair market value per share, the fair market value per share as determined by a
qualified independent appraiser selected by the Corporation and by the vote or written consent of
the Required Majority; or if the Corporation and the Required Majority cannot agree on an
appraiser, the average of the fair market value per share as determined by a qualified independent
appraiser selected by the Corporation and the fair market value per share as determined by a
qualified independent appraiser selected by the vote or written consent of the Required Majority.

(e) In the event the amount of Fixed Dividends to be paid on the Series A
Preferred Stock or the Series B Preferred Stock at any time is not sufficient to pay the accrued
but unpaid Fixed Dividends in full on such Series, any partial payment of such Fixed Dividends
will be made to the holders of such Series ratably (on an as-if converted basis) in proportion to
the aggregate accrued but unpaid portion of the Fixed Dividends on the shares of the applicable
Series of Preferred Stock held by such holders.
2. Liquidation Preference.

(a) In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of Series B Preferred Stock will be
entitled to receive in preference to the holders of all other equity securities of the Corporation an
amount per share equal to the greater of (A) the Series B Original Issue Price plus all accrued but
unpaid Fixed Dividends thereon, and (B) the aggregate amount that would be distributable with
respect to the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such
share of Series B Preferred Stock (assuming for purposes of such calculation, the conversion of
all other shares of Preferred Stock). If upon the occurrence of such event, the assets and funds
thus distributed among the holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit the
payment to such holders of the full aforesaid preferential amounts, then the entire assets and
funds of the Corporation legally available for distribution shall be distributed ratably among the
holders of Series B Preferred Stock in proportion to the preferential amount each such holder
would otherwise be entitled to receive. Thereafter, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock will
be entitled to receive in preference to the holders of Common Stock an amount per share equal to
the greater of (X) the Series A Original Issue Price plus all accrued but unpaid Fixed Dividends
thereon, and (Y) the aggregate amount that would be distributable with respect to the aggregate
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such share of Series A
Preferred Stock (assuming for purposes of such calculation, the conversion of all other shares of
Preferred Stock). If upon the occurrence of such event, the assets and funds thus distributed
among the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such
holders of the full aforesaid preferential amounts, then the entire assets and funds of the
Corporation legally available for distribution shall be distributed ratably among the holders of
Series A Preferred Stock in proportion to the preferential amount each such holder would
otherwise be entitled to receive.

(b) Upon the completion of the distribution required by subparagraph (a) of
this Section 2, the remaining assets and funds of the Corporation legally available for distribution
to stockholders of the Corporation shall be distributed as set forth in Article IV.C.2.

(c) fi) For purposes of this Article IV, unless otherwise agreed by the
vote or written consent of the Required Majority, a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation shall mean any of the following transactions: (A) the acquisition of the Corporation
by another entity by means of any transaction or series of related transactions (including, without
limitation, any reorganization, merger or consolidation) that results in the transfer of eighty
percent (80%) or more of the outstanding voting power of the Corporation; or (B) a sale of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Corporation.

(ii) If the consideration received by the Corporation upon a liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation is other than cash, its value will be deemed its fair
market value. Any securities shall be valued as follows:

(A) Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar
restrictions on free marketability covered by (B) below:
(1) If traded on a securities exchange, the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange over the thirty
(30) day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing of such event;

(2) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall
be deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the
thirty (30) day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing of such event; and

(3) If there is no active public market, the value shall be
the fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Corporation and the vote or written
consent of the Required Majority; or, if the Corporation and the Required Majority cannot agree
on the fair market value, the fair market value as determined by a qualified independent appraiser
selected by the Corporation and the vote or written consent of the Required Majority; or if the
Corporation and the Required Majority cannot agree on an appraiser, the average of the fair
market value as determined by a qualified independent appraiser selected by the Corporation and
the fair market value as determined by a qualified independent appraiser selected by the vote or
written consent of the Required Majority.

(B) The method of valuation of securities subject to investment
letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of
a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount
from the fair market value determined as above in (A) (1), (2) or (3) to reflect the approximate
fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Corporation and the vote or written
consent of the Required Majority; or, if the Corporation and the Required Majority cannot agree
on the discount, the discount as determined by a qualified independent appraiser selected by the
Corporation and the vote or written consent of the Required Majority; or if the Corporation and
the Required Majority cannot agree on an appraiser, the average of the discount as determined by
a qualified independent appraiser selected by the Corporation and the discount as determined by
a qualified independent appraiser selected by the vote or written consent of the Required
Majority.

3. Redemption.

(a) At any time and from time to time after December 31, 2011, any holders
of shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock may, with the vote or wmitten
consent of the Required Majority, require that the Corporation purchase the shares of Series A
Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock held by such holders, on a date selected by the
Required Majority (a “Redemption Date”) that is at least six (6) months after written notice is
given to the Corporation, and the Corporation shall purchase such shares, for a price per share
equal to the greater of: (A) the sum of (i) the Series A Original Issue Price or the Series B
Original Issue Price, as applicable, plus (ii) all accrued but unpaid dividends with respect to such
share, (B) an amount which, after taking into account the receipt of all prior Fixed Dividends and
Additional Dividends, provides a holder of such share with an amount equal to 150% of the
Series A Original Issue Price or the Series B Original Issue Price, as applicable, or (C) the fair
market value of such share as of the date of such notice as mutually determined by the Corpora-
tion and the vote or written consent of the Required Majority, or, if the Corporation and the
Required Majority cannot agree on the fair market value, the fair market value as determined by
a qualified independent appraiser selected by the Corporation and by the vote or written consent
of the Required Majority; or, if the Corpotation and the Required Majority cannot agree on an
appraiser, the average of the fair market value as determined by a qualified independent
appraiser selected by the Corporation and the fair market value as determined by a qualified
independent appraiser selected by the vote or written consent of the Required Majority.

(b) At least fifteen (15) but no more than thirty (30) days prior to each
Redemption Date, written notice (the “Redemption Notice”) shall be mailed, first class postage
prepaid, to each holder of record (at the close of business on the business day next preceding the
day on which notice is given) of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock to be
redeemed, at the address last shown on the records of the Corporation for such holder, notifying
such holder of the redemption to be effected on the applicable Redemption Date, specifying the
number of shares to be redeemed from such holder, the Redemption Date, the applicable
Redemption Price, the place at which payment may be obtained and calling upon such holder to
surrender to the Corporation, in the manner and at the place designated, the holder’s certificate or
certificates representing the shares to be redeemed (the “Redemption Shares”). Except as
provided in subsection (3)(c), on or after each Redemption Date, each holder of the Redemption
Shares to be redeemed on such Redemption Date shall surrender to the Corporation the
certificate or certificates representing such shares, in the manner and at the place designated in
the Redemption Notice, and thereupon the applicable Redemption Price of such shares shall be
payable to the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the
owner thereof and each surrendered certificate shall be canceled. In the event less than all the
shares represented by any such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued
representing the unredeemed shares.

(c) From and after the applicable Redemption Date, unless there shall have
been a default in payment of any applicable Redemption Price, all rights of the holders of
Redemption Shares designated for redemption on such Redemption Date in the Redemption
Notice as holders of such Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock (except the nght
to receive the applicable Redemption Price without interest upon surrender of their certificate or
certificates) shal] cease with respect to such shares, and such shares shall not thereafter be
transferred on the books of the Corporation or be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose
whatsoever. If the funds of the Corporation legally available for the redemption of the
Redemption Shares on a Redemption Date are insufficient to redeem the total number of shares
to be redeemed on such date, those funds that are legally available will be used to redeem the
maximum possible number of such shares, first among the holders of Series B Preferred Stock
(ratably, if necessary) and then among the holders of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock
(ratably, if necessary) to be redeemed such that each holder of a share of Series B Preferred
Stock to be redeemed receives for such share the same percentage of the applicable Redemption
Price as each other holder receives for any such share and such that each holder of a share of
Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed receives for such share the same percentage of the
applicable Redemption Price as each other holder receives for any such share. The Redemption
Shares not redeemed shall remain outstanding and entitled to all the rights and preferences
provided herein and the Fixed Dividends as provided for in Section 1 shall continue to accrue
with respect to such shares. At any time thereafter when additional funds of the Corporation are
legally available for the redemption of Redemption Shares, such funds will immediately be used
to redeem first the balance of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock, and then the balance of
shares of Series A Preferred Stock, that the Corporation has become obliged to redeem on the
Redemption Date but that it has not redeemed.

4. Conversion. The holders of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred
Stock shall have conversion obligations and rights as follows:

(a) Conversion Ratio. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B
Preferred Stock may at any time be converted as set forth below into such number of fully paid
and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Series A Original
Issue Price or the Series B Original Issue Price, as applicable, by the Conversion Price applicable
to such Series, determined as hereafter provided, in effect on the date the certificate is
surrendered for conversion. The initial Conversion Price per share for Series A Preferred Stock
and Series B Preferred Stock shall be the Series A Original Issue Price and the Series B Original
Issue Price, respectively; provided, however, that the Conversion Price for Series A Preferred
Stock and Series B Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in subsection 4(c).
Such conversion shall automatically occur immediately upon the Corporation’s sale of its
Common Stock in an underwritten public offering pursuant to a registration statement on Form
S-1 or Form SB-2 or any comparable successor form then in effect under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, the public offering price of which is not less than $4.15 per share (adjusted to
reflect subsequent stock dividends, stock splits or recapitalizations occurring after the Second
Amendment Date) and the net proceeds to the Corporation of which are not less than
$20,000,000 in the aggregate (net of underwriters’ discounts and expenses) (a “Qualifying IPO”)

(b) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Series A Preferred Stock
or Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to voluntarily convert the same into shares of
Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed,
at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for the Series, and shall give written
notice to the Corporation at its principal corporate office, of the election to convert the same and
shall state therein the name or names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of
Common Stock are to be issued. Any automatic conversion of Series A Preferred Stock and
Series B Preferred Stock will be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of
securities pursuant to such offering, in which event the conversion shall be deemed to have been
made and the persons entitled to receive the Common Stock upon conversion of the Series A
Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have converted such Series A
Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock immediately prior to the closing of such sale of
securities. Upon delivery of duly endorsed certificates for shares of Series A Preferred Stock or
Series B Preferred Stock to be voluntarily converted, or deemed to be automatically converted,
the Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such
holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or
nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock
to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid.

(c) onversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock for Splits and
Combinations. The applicable Conversion Price of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B
Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

(i)
(A) _ If the Corporation shall issue, at any time after August 2,
2006, any Additional Stock (as hereafter defined) without consideration or for a consideration
per share less than the Conversion Price for either the Series A Preferred Stock or Series B
Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock, the
Conversion Price for such Series in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall
forthwith be adjusted to the price per share of Additional Stock at which such Additional Stock is
so issued or sold or deemed issued or sold.

(B) In the case of the issuance of Common Stock for cash, the
consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefore before deducting any
reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the
Corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

(C) In the case of the issuance of the Common Stock for
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be
deemed to be the fair value thereof as determined by the Board of Directors irrespective of any
accounting treatment.

(D) In the case of the issuance of options to purchase or rights
to subscribe for Common Stock, securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for
Common Stock or options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or
exchangeable securities, the following provisions shall apply for all purposes of this subsection

4(c)():

(1) The aggregate maximum number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable upon exercise (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to
exercisability, including without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account
potential antidilution adjustments) of such options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common
Stock shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such options or rights were issued and for -
consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in subsections
4(c)(i)(B) and 4(c)(i)(C)), if any, received by the Corporation upon the issuance of such options
or rights plus the minimum exercise price provided in such options or rights (without taking into
account potential antidilution adjustments) for the Common Stock covered thereby.

(2) The aggregate maximum number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of, or in exchange for (assuming the satisfaction of
any conditions to convertibility or exchangeability, including, without limitation, the passage of
time, but without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments), any such convertible or
exchangeable securities or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for
such convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof shall
be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or such options or rights
were issued and for consideration equal to the consideration, if any, received by the Corporation
for any such securities and related options or rights (excluding any cash received on account of
accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the minimum additional consideration, if any, to be
received by the Corporation (without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) upon
the conversion or exchange of such securities or the exercise of any related options or rights (the
consideration in each case to be determined in the manner provided in subsections 4(c)(i)(B) and

4(c)(a)(C)).

(3) In the event of any change in the number of shares
of Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon exercise
of such options or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such convertible or
exchangeable securities, including, but not limited to, a change resulting from the antidilution
provisions thereof, the Conversion Price of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred
Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, rights or securities,
shall be recomputed to reflect such change, but no further adjustment shall be made for the actual
issuance of Common Stock or any payment of such consideration upon the exercise of any such
options or rights or the conversion or exchange of such securities.

(4) Upon the expiration of any such options or rights,
the termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options or
rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Conversion Price of the Series
A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected by such
- options, rights or securities or options or rights related to such securities, shall be readjusted as if
such options, rights or securities or options or rights related to such securities had not been
issued.

(ii) ‘Additional Stock” shall mean any shares of Common Stock
issued (or deemed to have been issued pursuant to subsection 4({c)(i)(D)) by the Corporation after
August 2, 2006 other than:

(A) Shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to a transaction
described in subsection 4(c)(ii) hereof;

(B) Shares of Series B Preferred Stock or warrants to purchase
shares of Common Stock (the “Warrants”) issued pursuant to that certain Confidential Private
Placement Memorandum of the Corporation dated July 7, 2006, as amended or supplemented
from time to time;

(C) Shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of the
Series A Preferred or the Series B Preferred Stock or upon the exercise of any Warrants;

(D) Shares of Common Stock issuable or issued to employees,

purposes) of the Corporation (i) directly or (ii) pursuant to any stock option plans or restricted
stock plan approved by the Board of Directors or assumed pursuant to an acquisition;

(E) Shares of Common Stock or options or warrants
exercisable for Common Stock issued with the approval of the Board of Directors to banks,
savings and loan associations, equipment lessors or other similar lending institutions in
connection with such entities providing credit facilities or financing to the Corporation;

(F) | Shares of Common Stock issued or issuable from time to
time pursuant to the acquisition of another business entity or business segment of any such entity
by the Corporation by merger, purchase of substantially all the assets or other reorganization
(other than a merger or other transaction described in Section 2(c)).

(ii) ‘In the event the Corporation should at any time or from time to
time after the Accrual Date fix a record date for the effectuation of a split or subdivision of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock or the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled
to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock or other
securities or rights convertible into, or entitling the holder thereof to receive directly or
indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock (hereinafter referred to as “Common Stock
Equivalents”) without payment of any consideration by such holder for the additional shares of
Common Stock or the Common Stock Equivalents (including the additional shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof), then, as of such record date (or the date of
such dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no record date is fixed), the Conversion Price of
the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock shall be appropriately decreased so
that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such Series
shall be increased in proportion to such increase of the aggregate of shares of Common Stock
outstanding and those issuable with respect to such Common Stock Equivalents with the number
of shares issuable with respect to Common Stock Equivalents determined from time to time in
the manner provided for deemed issuances in subsection 4(c)(i)(D).

(iii) | If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any time
after the Accrual Date is decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of Common
Stock, then, following the record date of such combination, the Conversion Price for the Series A
Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock shall be appropriately increased so that the number
of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such Series shall be
decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares.

(d)  Recapitalizations. If at any time or from time to time there shall be a
recapitalization of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision, combination, reorganization or
merger or sale of assets transaction provided for elsewhere in this Section 4 or in Section 2),
provision shall be made so that the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred
Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of such Series, in lieu of each share
of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion, the number of shares of stock or
other securities or property of the Company or otherwise, to which a holder of the number of
shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled upon such
recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the
provisions of this Section 4 with respect to the rights of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock
and Series B Preferred Stock after the recapitalization to the end that the provisions of this
Section 4 (including adjustment of the Conversion Price then in effect and the number of shares
purchasable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock) shall
be applicable after that event as nearly equivalent as may be practicable.

(e) No Impairment. The Corporation shalj not, by amendment of this
Certificate of Incorporation or through any reorganization, recapitalization, transfer of assets,
consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid
or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed
hereunder by the Corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all

10
the provisions of this Section 4 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or
appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock
and Series B Preferred Stock set forth in this Section 4 against impairment.

(f) No Fractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments.

(i) No fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of any
share or shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, and the number of shares
of Common Stock to be issued shall be rounded to the nearest whole share. Whether or not
fractional shares are issuable upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total
number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preférred Stock the holder is at the
time converting into Common Stock and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
such aggregate conversion.

(ii) | Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the
Conversion Price of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, pursuant to this
Section 4, the Corporation, at its expense, shall promptly compute such adjustment or
readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and prepare and furnish to each holder of
Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, a certificate setting forth such adjustment
or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is
based. The Corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of Series A
Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like
certificate setting forth (A) such adjustment and readjustment, (B) the Conversion Price for such
Series at the time in effect, and (C) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if
any, of other property that at the time would be received upon the conversion of such Series.

(g) Notices of Record Date. In the event of any taking by the Corporation of a
record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof
who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend) or other distribution, any
right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of stock of any class or any other
securities or property, or to receive any other right, the Corporation shall mail to each holder of
Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, at least ten (10) days prior to the date
