the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders shall be insufficient to pay the holders of
shares of Series D Preferred Stock the full amount to which they shall be entitled under this
Subsection 2.1.1, the holders of shares of Series D Preferred Stock shall share ratably in any
distribution of the assets available for distribution in proportion to the respective amounts which
would otherwise be payable in respect of the shares held by them upon such distribution if all
amounts payable on or with respect to such shares were paid in full.

2.1.2 In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution
or winding up of the Corporation or in a Deemed Liquidation Event (as defined in Subsection 2.3),
the holders of shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock, Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred
Stock, Series B+ Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock then outstanding shall be entitled, pari
passu, to be paid out of the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders,
subject to the rights of the holders of Series D Preferred Stock to receive the Series D Liquidation

referred to as the “Series Seed Liquidation Amount”), (W) with respect to the Series A Preferred

(ii) such amount per share as would have been payable had all shares of Series A Preferred Stock
been converted into Common Stock pursuant to Section 4 immediately prior to such liquidation,
dissolution or winding up (the amount payable pursuant to this sentence is hereinafter referred to as
the “Series A Liquidation Amount”), (X) with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock, (i) two (2)
times the Series B Original Issue Price, plus any dividends declared but unpaid thereon, or (ii) such

purposes of making the calculations set forth in subsection (V)(ii), (W)(ii), (X)(i), CYC) and (Z)(ii)
of the immediately preceding sentence, all shares of each such series of Preferred Stock that would
receive a greater per share liquidation preference if converted into Common Stock than remaining
Preferred Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted into Common Stock. If upon any such
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the assets of the Corporation available for
distribution to its stockholders shall be insufficient to pay the holders of shares of Series Seed
Preferred Stock, Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series B+ Preferred Stock and
Series C Preferred Stock the full amount to which they shall be entitled under this Subsection 2.1.2,
the holders of shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock, Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred

liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation or in a Deemed Liquidation Event (as

available for distribution to its stockholders shall be distributed among the holders of shares of Series
D Preferred Stock and Common Stock, pro rata based on the number of shares held by each such
holder, treating for this purpose all shares of Series D Preferred Stock as if they had been converted to
Common Stock pursuant to the terms of the Certificate of Incorporation immediately prior to such
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation.

surviving or resulting corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary of another corporation

outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation and, if applicable, converted or
exchanged in such merger or consolidation on the same terms as the actual outstanding shares of
Common Stock are converted or exchanged); or

disposition, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, by the Corporation or any
subsidiary of the Corporation of all or substantially all the assets of the Corporation and its

total number of shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock, Series A Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock, Series B+ Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock or Series D Preferred Stock
the holder is at the time converting into Common Stock and the aggregate number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion.

43 Mechanics of Conversion.

4.3.1 Notice of Conversion. In order for a holder of Preferred Stock to
voluntarily convert shares of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall
surrender the certificate or certificates for such shares of Preferred Stock (or, if such registered holder
alleges that such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and
agreement reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against any claim
that may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such
certificate), at the office of the transfer agent for the Preferred Stock (or at the principal office of the
Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent), together with written notice that such
holder elects to convert all or any number of the shares of the Preferred Stock represented by such
certificate or certificates and, if applicable, any event on which such conversion is contingent. Such
notice shall state such holder’s name or the names of the nominees in which such holder wishes the
certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued. If required by the Corporation,
certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or
instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder
or his, her or its attorney duly authorized in writing. The close of business on the date of receipt by
the transfer agent (or by the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent) of such
certificates (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement) and notice shall be the time of conversion (the
“Conversion Time”), and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the shares
represented by such certificate shall be deemed to be outstanding of record as of such date. The
Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after the Conversion Time, issue and deliver to such holder

{M0708595.4 }

16
of Preferred Stock, or to his, her or its nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of full
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof, a
certificate for the number (if any) of the shares of Preferred Stock represented by the surrendered
certificate that were not converted into Common Stock, and cash as provided in Subsection 4.2 in lieu
of any fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion and payment of
any declared but unpaid dividends on the shares of Preferred Stock converted.

4.3.2 Reservation of Shares. The Corporation shall at all times when
any shares of Preferred Stock shall be outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized
but unissued capital stock, for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Preferred Stock, such
number of its duly authorized shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to
effect the conversion of all outstanding Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized
but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then
outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall take such corporate action as may be
necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares
as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to
obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to the Certificate of
Incorporation. Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment reducing the Series Seed
Conversion Price, the Series A Conversion Price, the Series B Conversion Price, the Series B+
Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price or the Series D Conversion Price below the then par
value of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series Seed Preferred Stock,
Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series B+ Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred
Stock or Series D Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take any corporate action which may, in the
opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Corporation may validly and legally issue fully
paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock at such adjusted Series Seed Conversion Price,
Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series B+ Conversion Price, Series C
Conversion Price or Series D Conversion Price, as applicable.

4.33 Effect of Conversion. All shares of Preferred Stock that shall have
been surrendered for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and
all rights with respect to such shares shall immediately cease and terminate at the Conversion Time,
except only the right of the holders thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor
and to receive payment of any dividends declared but unpaid thereon. Any shares of Preferred Stock
so converted shall be retired and cancelled and may not be reissued as shares of such series, and the
Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate action (without the need for stockholder action) as
may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of such series of Preferred Stock
accordingly.

4.3.4 No _Further_ Adjustment. Upon any such conversion, no
adjustment to the Series Seed Conversion Price shall be made for any declared but unpaid dividends
on the Series Seed Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion or on the Common Stock delivered
upon conversion. Upon any such conversion, no adjustment to the Series A Conversion Price shall be
made for any declared but unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock surrendered for
conversion or on the Common Stock delivered upon conversion. Upon any such conversion, no
adjustment to the Series B Conversion Price shall be made for any declared but unpaid dividends on
the Series B Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion or on the Common Stock delivered upon
conversion. Upon any such conversion, no adjustment to the Series B+ Conversion Price shail be

(M0708595.4 }

17
made for any declared but unpaid dividends on the Series B+ Preferred Stock surrendered for
conversion or on the Common Stock delivered upon conversion. Upon any such conversion, no
adjustment to the Series C Conversion Price shall be made for any declared but unpaid dividends on
the Series C Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion or on the Common Stock delivered upon
conversion. Upon any such conversion, no adjustment to the Series D Conversion Price shall be
made for any accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock surrendered for
conversion or on the Common Stock delivered upon conversion.

4.3.5 Taxes. The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and other
similar taxes that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of Common Stock
upon conversion of shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4. The Corporation shall not,
however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the
issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in which the shares of
Preferred Stock so converted were registered, and no such issuance or delivery shall be made unless
and until the person or entity requesting such issuance has paid to the Corporation the amount of any
such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax has been paid.

issuance of which did not result in an adjustment to the Series D Conversion Price pursuant to
the terms of Subsection 4.4.4 (either because the consideration per share (determined pursuant to
Subsection 4.4.5) of the Additional Shares of Common Stock subject thereto was equal to or
greater than the Series D Conversion Price then in effect, or because such Option or Convertible
Security was issued before the Series D Original Issue Date), are revised after the Series D
Original Issue Date as a result of an amendment to such terms or any other adjustment pursuant
to the provisions of such Option or Convertible Security (but excluding automatic adjustments to
such terms pursuant to anti-dilution or similar provisions of such Option or Convertible Security)
to provide for either (1) any increase in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
the exercise, conversion or exchange of any such Option or Convertible Security or (2) any
decrease in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion or
exchange, then such Option or Convertible Security, as so amended or adjusted, and the
Additional Shares of Common Stock subject thereto (determined in the manner provided in
Subsection 4.4.3(a) shall be deemed to have been issued effective upon such increase or decrease
becoming effective.

(d) Upon the expiration or termination of any unexercised
Option or unconverted or unexchanged Convertible Security (or portion thereof) which resulted
(either upon its original issuance or upon a revision of its terms) in an adjustment to the Series D
Conversion Price pursuant to the terms of Subsection 4.4.4, the Series D Conversion Price shall
be readjusted to such Series D Conversion Price as would have obtained had such Option or
Convertible Security (or portion thereof) never been issued.

(e) If the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
the exercise, conversion and/or exchange of any Option or Convertible Security, or the
consideration payable to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion and/or exchange, is
calculable at the time such Option or Convertible Security is issued or amended but is subject to
adjustment based upon subsequent events, any adjustment to the Series D Conversion Price
provided for in this Subsection 4.4.3 shall be effected at the time of such issuance or amendment
based on such number of shares or amount of consideration without regard to any provisions for
subsequent adjustments (and any subsequent adjustments shall be treated as provided in clauses
(b) and (c) of this Subsection 4.4.3). If the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
the exercise, conversion and/or exchange of any Option or Convertible Security, or the
consideration payable to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion and/or exchange,
cannot be calculated at all at the time such Option or Convertible Security is issued or amended,
any adjustment to the Series D Conversion Price that would result under the terms of this
Subsection 4.4.3 at the time of such issuance or amendment shall instead be effected at the time
such number of shares and/or amount of consideration is first calculable (even if subject to
subsequent adjustments), assuming for purposes of calculating such adjustment to the Series D
Conversion Price that such issuance or amendment took place at the time such calculation can
first be made.

4.4.4 Adjustment of Series C Conversion Price and Series D Conversion
Price Upon Issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock. After the final sale and issuance of
Series D Preferred Stock pursuant to the Series D Purchase Agreement, the Series C Conversion Price

shall be reduced to a price (calculated to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent), determined in
accordance with the Conversion Formula (as defined below). In the event the Corporation shall at
any time on or after the Series D Original Issue Date issue Additional Shares of Common Stock
(including Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to Subsection 4.4.3),
without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Series D Conversion Price in
effect immediately prior to such issue, then the Series D Conversion Price shall be reduced,
concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent),
determined in accordance with the Conversion Formula (as defined below). For purposes of
determining the Series C Conversion Price, the "Conversion Formula” is:

CP, = CP)* (A+B)=(A+C
3

and for purposes of determining the Series D Conversion Price, the "Conversion Formula" is:
For purposes of the foregoing formula, the following definitions shall apply:

(a) “CP,” shall mean the Series C Conversion Price or
the Series D Conversion Price, as applicable, in effect immediately after such issue of Additional
Shares of Common Stock;

4.4.5 “CP,” shall mean, in the case of an adjustment of the Series C
Conversion Price, an amount equal to three times the Series C Conversion Price or, in the case of an
adjustment of the Series D Conversion Price, the Series D Conversion Price, as applicable, in effect
immediately prior to such issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock;

(b) “A” shall mean the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock
(treating for this purpose as outstanding all shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
Options outstanding immediately prior to such issue or upon conversion or exchange of
Convertible Securities (including the Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock)
outstanding (assuming exercise of any outstanding Options therefor) immediately prior to such
issue);

(c) “B” shall mean the number of shares of Common
Stock that would have been issued if such Additional Shares of Common Stock had been issued
at a price per share equal to CP, (determined by dividing the aggregate consideration received by
the Corporation in respect of such issue by CP); and

(d) “C” shall mean the number of such Additional
Shares of Common Stock issued in such transaction.

{M0708595.4 }

22
4.4.6

Determination of Consideration.

For purposes of this

Subsection 4.4, the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional Shares

of Common Stock shall be computed as follows:

(a)

(b)

Cash and Property: Such consideration shall:

(i) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
aggregate amount of cash received by the
Corporation, excluding amounts paid or payable
for accrued interest;

(ii) insofar as it consists of property other than cash,
be computed at the fair market value thereof at
the time of such issue, as determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation; and

(iii) in the event Additional Shares of Common
Stock are issued together with other shares or
securities or other assets of the Corporation for
consideration which covers both, be the
proportion of such consideration so received,
computed as provided in clauses (i) and (ii)
above, as determined in good faith by the Board
of Directors of the Corporation.

Options and Convertible Securities. The

consideration per share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock
deemed to have been issued pursuant to Subsection 4.4.3, relating to Options and Convertible

Securities, shall be determined by dividing

{M0708595.4 }

(i) the total amount, if any, received or receivable
by the Corporation as consideration for the issue
of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus
the minimum aggregate amount of additional
consideration (as set forth in the instruments
relating thereto, without regard to any provision
contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of
such consideration) payable to the Corporation
upon the exercise of such Options or the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, or in the case of Options for
Convertible Securities, the exercise of such
Options for Convertible Securities and the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, by

23
(ii) the maximum number of shares of Common
Stock (as set forth in the instruments relating
thereto, without regard to any provision
contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of
such number) issuable upon the exercise of such
Options or the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options
for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such
Options for Convertible Securities and the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities.

4.4.7 Multiple Closing Dates. In the event the Corporation shall issue on
more than one date Additional Shares of Common Stock that are a part of one transaction or a series
of related transactions and that would result in an adjustment to the Series C Conversion Price or the
Series D Conversion Price, as applicable, pursuant to the terms of Subsection 4.4.4 then, upon the
final such issuance, the Series C Conversion Price or the Series D Conversion Price, as applicable,
shall be readjusted to give effect to all such issuances as if they occurred on the date of the first such
issuance (and without giving effect to any additional adjustments as a result of any such subsequent
issuances within such period).

4.5 Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If the Corporation shall at
any time or from time to time after the Series D Original Issue Date effect a subdivision of the

outstanding Common Stock without a corresponding subdivision of the Series Seed Preferred
Stock, Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series B+ Preferred Stock, Series C
Preferred Stock or Series D Preferred Stock, the Series Seed Conversion Price, Series A
Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series B+ Conversion Price, Series C Conversion
Price and/or the Series D Conversion Price, as applicable, in effect immediately before that
subdivision shall be proportionately decreased so that the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be increased in proportion to such
increase in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. If the Corporation
shall at any time or from time to time after the Series D Original Issue Date, combine the
outstanding shares of Common Stock without a corresponding combination of the Series Seed
Conversion Price, Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series B+ Conversion
Price, Series C Conversion Price or Series D Conversion Price, then the Series Seed Conversion
Price, Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series B+ Conversion Price, Series
C Conversion Price and/or the Series D Conversion Price, as applicable, in effect immediately
before the combination shall be proportionately increased so that the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be decreased in
proportion to such decrease in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding.
Any adjustment under this subsection shall become effective at the close of business on the date
the subdivision or combination becomes effective.

46 Adjustment for Certain Dividends and Distributions. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Series D Original Issue Date shall make or

issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive,
a dividend or other distribution payable on the Common Stock in additional shares of Common

{M0708595 4 }

24
Stock, then and in each such event the Series Seed Conversion Price, Series A Conversion Price,
Series B Conversion Price, Series B+ Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price and Series D
Conversion Price in effect immediately before such event shall be decreased as of the time of
such issuance or, in the event such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business
on such record date, by multiplying the Series Seed Conversion Price, Series A Conversion
Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series B+ Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price and the
Series D Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction:

(1) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares
of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the time of such issuance or the close of business
on such record date, and

(2) the denominator of which shall be the total number of
shares of Common Stock issued and _ outstanding
immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close
of business on such record date plus the number of shares
of Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or
distribution.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) if such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend is
not fully paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the Series Seed
Conversion Price, Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series B+ Conversion
Price, Series C Conversion Price and Series D Conversion Price shall be recomputed accordingly
as of the close of business on such record date and thereafter the Series Seed Conversion Price,
Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series B+ Conversion Price, Series C
Conversion Price and Series D Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this subsection as
of the time of actual payment of such dividends or distributions; and (b) that no such adjustment
shall be made if the holders of Series Seed Preferred Stock, Series A Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock, Series B+ Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred
Stock, as applicable, simultaneously receive a dividend or other distribution of shares of
Common Stock in a number equal to the number of shares of Common Stock as they would have
received if all outstanding shares of such Series Seed Preferred Stock, Series A Preferred Stock,
Series B Preferred Stock, Series B+ Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock or Series D
Preferred Stock, as the case may be, had been converted into Common Stock on the date of such
event.

4.7 Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Series D Original Issue Date shall make or

issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive,
a dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the Corporation (other than a distribution
of shares of Common Stock in respect of outstanding shares of Common Stock) or in other
property and the provisions of Section 1 do not apply to such dividend or distribution, then and
in each such event the holders of Series Seed Preferred Stock, Series A Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock, Series B+ Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred
Stock shall receive, simultaneously with the distribution to the holders of Common Stock, a
dividend or other distribution of such securities or other property in an amount equal to the

{M0708595.4 }

25
amount of such securities or other property as they would have received if all outstanding shares
of Series Seed Preferred Stock, Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series B+
Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock or Series D Preferred Stock, as applicable, had been
converted into Common Stock on the date of such event.

4.8 Adjustment for Merger or Reorganization, etc. Subject to the provisions
of Subsection 2.3, if there shall occur any reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,

consolidation or merger involving the Corporation in which the Common Stock (but not the
Series Seed Preferred Stock, Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series B+
Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock or Series D Preferred Stock) is converted into or
exchanged for securities, cash or other property (other than a transaction covered by Subsections
4.5, 4.6 or 4.7), then, following any such reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
consolidation or merger, each share of Series Seed Preferred Stock, Series A Preferred Stock,
Series B Preferred Stock, Series B+ Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and/or Series D
Preferred Stock, as applicable, shal! thereafter be convertible in lieu of the Common Stock into
which it was convertible prior to such event into the kind and amount of securities, cash or other
property which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation issuable
upon conversion of one share of Series Seed Preferred Stock, Series A Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock, Series B+ Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock or Series D Preferred
Stock, as applicable, immediately prior to such reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
consolidation or merger would have been entitled to receive pursuant to such transaction; and, in
such case, appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation) shall be made in the application of the provisions in this Section 4 with respect to
the rights and interests thereafter of the holders of the Series Seed Preferred Stock, Series A
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series B+ Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock
and Series D Preferred Stock, as applicable, to the end that the provisions set forth in this Section
4 (including provisions with respect to changes in and other adjustments of the Series Seed
Conversion Price, Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series B+ Preferred Stock,
Series C Conversion Price and/or Series D Conversion Price, as applicable) shal! thereafter be
applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any securities or other property
thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of the Series Seed Preferred Stock, Series A Preferred
Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series B+ Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and/or
Series D Preferred Stock, as applicable.

49 Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Series Seed Conversion Price, Series A Conversion Price, Series B
Conversion Price, Series B+ Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price or Series D
Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation at its expense shall, as promptly as
reasonably practicable but in any event not later than 10 days thereafter, compute such
adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to each holder of
Series Seed Preferred Stock, Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series B+
Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and/or Series D Preferred Stock, as applicable, a
certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment (including the kind and amount of
securities, cash or other property into which such series of Preferred Stock is convertible) and
showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The
Corporation shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the written request at any time of
any holder of Preferred Stock (but in any event not later than 10 days thereafter), furnish or cause

{M0708595.4 }

26
to be furnished to such holder a certificate setting forth (i) the Series Seed Conversion Price,
Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series B+ Conversion Price, Series C
Conversion Price and Series D Conversion Price then in effect, and (ii) the number of shares of
Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other securities, cash or property which then would be
received upon the conversion of such series of Preferred Stock.

4.10 Notice of Record Date. In the event:

(a) the Corporation shall take a record of the holders of its
Common Stock (or other capital stock or securities at the time issuable upon conversion of the
Preferred Stock) for the purpose of entitling or enabling them to receive any dividend or other
distribution, or to receive any right to subscribe for or purchase any shares of capital stock of any
class or any other securities, or to receive any other security; or

(b) of any capital reorganization of the Corporation, any
reclassification of the Common Stock of the Corporation, or any Deemed Liquidation Event; or

(c) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or
winding-up of the Corporation,

then, and in each such case, the Corporation will send or cause to be sent to the holders of the
Preferred Stock a notice specifying, as the case may be, (i) the record date for such dividend,
distribution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right, or (ii)
the effective date on which such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer,
dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is proposed to take place, and the time, if any is to be
fixed, as of which the holders of record of Common Stock (or such other capital stock or
securities at the time issuable upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be entitled to
exchange their shares of Common Stock (or such other capital stock or securities) for securities
or other property deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger,
transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, and the amount per share and character of such
exchange applicable to each series of Preferred Stock and the Common Stock. Such notice shall
be sent at least 10 days prior to the record date or effective date for the event specified in such
notice.

5. Mandatory Conversion.

5.1 Trigger Events. Upon either (a) the closing of the sale of shares of
Common Stock to the public at a price of at least five (5) times the Series D Original Issue Price
per share (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split,
combination or other similar recapitalization with respect to the Common Stock), in a firm-
commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, resulting in at least $35,000,000 of gross proceeds to the
Corporation (a “Qualified Public Offering”), or (b) the date and time, or the occurrence of an
event, specified by vote or written consent of the holders of at least sixty percent (60%) of the
then outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class, provided,
however, that if an automatic conversion pursuant to this clause “(b)” of this Subsection 5.1 is
effected in connection with and within 60 days prior to the Corporation’s entering into an

{MO708595 4 }

27
agreement for a Deemed Liquidation Event in which the gross proceeds (inclusive of amounts
subject to escrow or other contingency arrangements to support the accuracy of representations
of the Corporation or its stockholders, whether or not such amounts are ultimately received by
the stockholders of the Corporation) payable with respect to each share of Series B Preferred
Stock are less the Series B Original Issue Price (plus any dividends declared but unpaid thereon)
such automatic conversion shall not be effective with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock
unless such automatic conversion has also been approved by the vote or written consent of the
holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock, voting together
as a separate class (the time of such closing or the date and time specified or the time of the event
specified in such vote or written consent is referred to herein as the “Mandatory Conversion
Time’), (i) all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into shares
of Common Stock, at the then effective conversion rate and (ii) such shares may not be reissued
by the Corporation.

5.2. Procedural Requirements. All holders of record of shares of Preferred
Stock shall be sent written notice of the Mandatory Conversion Time and the place designated
for mandatory conversion of all such shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 5. Such
notice need not be sent in advance of the occurrence of the Mandatory Conversion Time. Upon
receipt of such notice, each holder of shares of Preferred Stock shall surrender his, her or its
certificate or certificates for all such shares (or, if such holder alleges that such certificate has
been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to
the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made against the
Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate) to the
Corporation at the place designated in such notice. If so required by the Corporation, certificates
surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by written instrument or
instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered
holder or by his, her or its attorney duly authorized in writing. All rights with respect to the
Preferred Stock converted pursuant to Subsection 5.1, including the rights, if any, to receive
notices and vote (other than as a holder of Common Stock), will terminate at the Mandatory
Conversion Time (notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender the
certificates at or prior to such time), except only the rights of the holders thereof, upon surrender
of their certificate or certificates (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement) therefor, to receive
the items provided for in the next sentence of this Subsection 5.2. As soon as practicable after
the Mandatory Conversion Time and the surrender of the certificate or certificates (or lost
certificate affidavit and agreement) for Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall issue and deliver to
such holder, or to his, her or its nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of full
shares of Common Stock issuable on such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof,
together with cash as provided in Subsection 4.2 in lieu of any fraction of a share of Common
Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion and the payment of any declared but unpaid
dividends on the shares of Preferred Stock converted, plus, solely in the case of a conversion
triggered by a Qualified Public Offering, payment in cash of any Series D Dividends accrued but
unpaid thereon, whether or not declared. Such converted Preferred Stock shall be retired and
cancelled and may not be reissued as shares of such series, and the Corporation may thereafter
take such appropriate action (without the need for stockholder action) as may be necessary to
reduce the authorized number of shares of Preferred Stock accordingly.

6. Redemption.

{M0708595 4 }

28
6.1 Redemption, Shares of Series D Preferred Stock shall be redeemed by the
Corporation out of funds lawfully available therefor at a price equal to the sum of the Series D
Original Issue price per share, plus any Series D Dividends accrued but unpaid thereon, whether
or not declared, together with any other dividends declared but unpaid thereon (the “Series D
Redemption Price”), in three annual installments commencing 60 days after receipt by the
Corporation at any time on or after December 19, 2019, from the holders of at least sixty percent
(60%) of the then outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock of written notice requesting
redemption of all shares of Series D Preferred Stock (the date of each such installment being
referred to as a “Series D Redemption Date”). Until all of the shares of Series D Preferred
Stock which are not Excluded Shares (as such term is defined in Subsection 6.2) have been
redeemed in full out of lawfully available funds therefor, the Corporation shall redeem on each
Series D Redemption Date solely the Series D Preferred Stock on a pro rata basis in accordance
with the number of shares of Series D Preferred Stock owned by each holder for which
redemption has been requested pursuant to this Subsection 6.1, that number of outstanding shares
of Series D Preferred Stock determined by dividing (i) the number of shares of Series D
Preferred Stock owned by such holder by (ii) the total number of shares of Series D Preferred
Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Series D Redemption Date; provided, however, that
Excluded Shares shall not be redeemed and shall be excluded from the calculations set forth in
this sentence. Once all of the shares of Series D Preferred Stock which are not Excluded Shares
shall have been redeemed in full, shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock,
Series B+ Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock shall be redeemed by the Corporation
out of funds lawfully available therefor at a price equal to the sum of (i) in the case of the Series
A Preferred Stock, the Series A Original Issue Price per share, plus all declared but unpaid
dividends thereon (the “Series A Redemption Price”), (ii) in the case of the Series B Preferred
Stock, the Series B Original Issue Price per share, plus all declared but unpaid dividends thereon
(the “Series B Redemption Price”), (iii) in the case of the Series B+ Preferred Stock, the Series
B+ Original Issue price per share, plus all declared but unpaid dividends thereon (the “Series B+
Redemption Price’), and (iv) in the case of the Series C Preferred Stock, the Series C Original
Issue price per share, plus al! declared but unpaid dividends thereon (the “Series C Redemption
Price’), in three annual installments commencing 60 days after receipt by the Corporation at any
time on or after the final Series D Redemption Date, from the holders of at least a majority of the
then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series B+
Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock voting together as a single class, of written notice
requesting redemption of all shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series
B+ Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock (the date of each such installment being
referred to as a “Subsequent Redemption Date” and, collectively with each Series D
Redemption Date, as a “Redemption Date”). On each Subsequent Redemption Date, the
Corporation shall redeem, on a pro rata basis in accordance with the number of shares of Series
A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series B+ Preferred Stock, and Series C Preferred
Stock owned by each holder for which redemption has been requested pursuant to this
Subsection 6.1, that number of outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock, Series B+ Preferred Stock, and Series C Preferred Stock determined by dividing
(i) the total number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series B+
Preferred Stock, and Series C Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Subsequent
Redemption Date by (ii) the number of remaining Subsequent Redemption Dates (including the
Subsequent Redemption Date to which such calculation applies); provided, however, that

{MO708595.4 }

29
Excluded Shares shall not be redeemed and shall be excluded from the calculations set forth in
this sentence. If the Corporation does not have sufficient funds legally available to redeem on
any Subsequent Redemption Date all shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred
Stock, Series B+ Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such
Subsequent Redemption Date, the Corporation shall redeem a pro rata portion of each holder’s
redeemable shares of such capital stock out of funds legally available therefor, based on the
respective amounts which would otherwise be payable in respect of the shares to be redeemed if
the legally available funds were sufficient to redeem all such shares, and shall redeem the
remaining shares to have been redeemed as soon as practicable after the Corporation has funds
legally available therefor. Notwithstanding the requirements and obligations set forth in this
Subsection 6.1, the Corporation shall not redeem, and shall have no obligation to redeem, any
shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series B+ Preferred Stock, Series C
Preferred Stock or Series D Preferred Stock for as long as all or any portion of the indebtedness
represented by that certain promissory note issued by the Corporation and dated October 15,
2010, remains outstanding.

6.2 Redemption Notice. Written notice of the mandatory redemption (the
“Redemption Notice’) shall be sent to each holder of record of Series A Preferred Stock, Series
B Preferred Stock, Series B+ Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred
Stock not less than 40 days prior to each Redemption Date. Each Redemption Notice shall state:

(a) the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock, Series B+ Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and/or Series D Preferred
Stock held by the holder that the Corporation shall redeem on the Redemption Date specified in
the Redemption Notice;

(b) the Redemption Date and the Redemption Price;

(c) the date upon which the holder’s right to convert such
shares terminates (as determined in accordance with Subsection 4.1); and

(d) that the holder is to surrender to the Corporation, in the
manner and at the place designated, his, her or its certificate or certificates representing the
shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series B+ Preferred Stock, Series C
Preferred Stock or Series D Preferred Stock to be redeemed.

If the Corporation receives, on or prior to the 20th day after the date of delivery of the
Redemption Notice to a holder of record of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock,
Series B+ Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock or Series D Preferred Stock, written notice
from such holder that such holder elects to be excluded from the redemption provided in this
Section 6, then the shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series B+
Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and/or Series D Preferred Stock registered on the
books of the Corporation in the name of such holder at the time of the Corporation’s receipt of
such notice shall thereafter be “Excluded Shares”. Excluded Shares shall not be redeemed or
redeemable pursuant to this Section 6, whether on such Redemption Date or thereafter.

{M0708595.4 }

30
6.3 Surrender_of Certificates; Payment. On or before the applicable
Redemption Date, each holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock,

Series B+ Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock to be redeemed
on such Redemption Date, unless such holder has exercised his, her or its right to convert such
shares as provided in Section 4, shall surrender the certificate or certificates representing such
shares (or, if such registered holder alleges that such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed,
a lost certificate affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify
the Corporation against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the
alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate) to the Corporation, in the manner and at the
place designated in the Redemption Notice, and thereupon the Series A Redemption Price, Series
B Redemption Price, Series B+ Redemption Price, Series C Redemption Price or Series D
Redemption Price, as applicable, for such shares shall be payable to the order of the person
whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof. In the event less
than all of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series B+ Preferred
Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock represented by a certificate are
redeemed, a new certificate representing the unredeemed shares of Series A Preferred Stock,
Series B Preferred Stock, Series B+ Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and Series D
Preferred Stock shall promptly be issued to such holder.

6.4 Rights Subsequent to Redemption. If the Redemption Notice shall have
been duly given, and if on the applicable Redemption Date the Series A Redemption Price,
Series B Redemption Price, Series B+ Redemption Price, Series C Redemption Price and Series
D Redemption Price payable upon redemption of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock, Series B+ Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred
Stock, as applicable, to be redeemed on such Redemption Date is paid or tendered for payment
or deposited with an independent payment agent so as to be available therefor, then
notwithstanding that the certificates evidencing any of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock,
Series B Preferred Stock, Series B+ Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock or Series D
Preferred Stock so called for redemption shall not have been surrendered, dividends with respect
to such shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series B+ Preferred Stock,
Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock shall cease to accrue after such

office address last shown on the records of the Corporation, or given by electronic

FIFTH: Subject to any additional vote required by the Certificate of
Incorporation, in furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by statute, the Board
of Directors is expressly authorized to make, repeal, alter, amend and rescind any or all of the
Bylaws of the Corporation.

SIXTH: Subject to any additional vote required by the Certificate of
Incorporation, the number of directors of the Corporation shall be determined in the manner set
forth in the Bylaws of the Corporation.

SEVENTH: Elections of directors need not be by written ballot unless the
Bylaws of the Corporation shall so provide.

EIGHTH: Meetings of stockholders may be held within or without the State
of Delaware, as the Bylaws of the Corporation may provide. The books of the Corporation may
be kept outside the State of Delaware at such place or places as may be designated from time to
time by the Board of Directors or in the Bylaws of the Corporation.

NINTH: To the fullest extent permitted by law, a director of the Corporation
shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for
breach of fiduciary duty as a director. If the General Corporation Law or any other law of the
State of Delaware is amended after approval by the stockholders of this Article Ninth to
authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then
the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent
permitted by the General Corporation Law as so amended.

Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article Ninth by
the stockholders of the Corporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director
of the Corporation existing at the time of, or increase the liability of any director of the
Corporation with respect to any acts or omissions of such director occurring prior to, such repeal
or modification.

TENTH: The following indemnification provisions shall apply to the
persons enumerated below.

1. Right to Indemnification of Directors and Officers. The Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as it presently

exists or may hereafter be amended, any person (an “Indemnified Person”) who was or is made
or is threatened to be made a party or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a “Proceeding”), by reason of the fact
that such person, or a person for whom such person is the legal representative, is or was a
director or officer of the Corporation or, while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another

(M0708595.4 }

32
Corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, limited liability company, trust, enterprise or
nonprofit entity, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, against all liability and
loss suffered and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) reasonably incurred by such Indemnified
Person in such Proceeding. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except as otherwise
provided in Section 3 of this Article Tenth, the Corporation shall be required to indemnify an
Indemnified Person in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) commenced by such
Indemnified Person only if the commencement of such Proceeding (or part thereof) by the
Indemnified Person was authorized in advance by the Board of Directors.

2. Prepayment of Expenses of Directors and Officers. The Corporation shall pay the
expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by an Indemnified Person in defending any

Proceeding in advance of its final disposition, provided, however, that, to the extent required by
law, such payment of expenses in advance of the final disposition of the Proceeding shall be
made only upon receipt of an undertaking by the Indemnified Person to repay all amounts
advanced if it should be ultimately determined that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to be
indemnified under this Article Tenth or otherwise.

3. Claims by Directors and Officers. If a claim for indemnification or advancement
of expenses under this Article Tenth is not paid in full within 30 days after a written claim
therefor by the Indemnified Person has been received by the Corporation, the Indemnified Person
may file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in whole or in part,
shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim. In any such action the
Corporation shall have the burden of proving that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to the
requested indemnification or advancement of expenses under applicable law.

4. Indemnification of Employees and Agents. The Corporation may indemnify and
advance expenses to any person who was or is made or is threatened to be made or is otherwise
involved in any Proceeding by reason of the fact that such person, or a person for whom such
person is the legal representative, is or was an employee or agent of the Corporation or, while an
employee or agent of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture,
limited liability company, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with respect to
employee benefit plans, against all liability and loss suffered and expenses (including attorney’s
fees) reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such Proceeding. The ultimate
determination of entitlement to indemnification of persons who are non-director or officer
employees or agents shall be made in such manner as is determined by the Board of Directors in
its sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Corporation shall not be required
to indemnify a person in connection with a Proceeding initiated by such person if the Proceeding
was not authorized in advance by the Board of Directors.

5. Advancement of Expenses of Employees and Agents. The Corporation may pay
the expenses (including attorney’s fees) incurred by an employee or agent in defending any

Proceeding in advance of its final disposition on such terms and conditions as may be determined
by the Board of Directors.

6. Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The rights conferred on any person by this Article
Tenth shall not be exclusive of any other rights which such person may have or hereafter acquire

{M0708595.4 }

33
under any statute, provision of the certificate of incorporation, these by-laws, agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

7. Other Indemnification. The Corporation’s obligation, if any, to indemnify any
person who was or is serving at its request as a director, officer or employee of another
Corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, organization or other
enterprise shall be reduced by any amount such person may collect as indemnification from such
other Corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, organization or
other enterprise.

8. Insurance. The Board of Directors may, to the full extent permitted by applicable
law as it presently exists, or may hereafter be amended from time to time, authorize an
appropriate officer or officers to purchase and maintain at the Corporation’s expense insurance:
(a) to indemnify the Corporation for any obligation which it incurs as a result of the
indemnification of directors, officers and employees under the provisions of this Article Tenth;
and (b) to indemnify or insure directors, officers and employees against liability in instances in
which they may not otherwise be indemnified by the Corporation under the provisions of this
Article Tenth.

9. Amendment or Repeal. Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of
this Article Tenth shall not adversely affect any right or protection hereunder of any person in
respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification. The
rights provided hereunder shall inure to the benefit of any Indemnified Person and such person’s
heirs, executors and administrators.

ELEVENTH: The Corporation renounces any interest or expectancy of the
Corporation in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any Excluded Opportunity.
An “Excluded Opportunity” is any matter, transaction or interest that is presented to, or
acquired, created or developed by, or which otherwise comes into the possession of, (i) any
director of the Corporation who is not an employee of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries,
or (ii) any holder of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series D Preferred
Stock, any affiliate of any such holder, or any partner, member, director, stockholder, employee
or agent of any such holder or any such affiliate, other than someone who is an employee of the
Corporation or any of its subsidiaries (collectively, “Covered Persons”), unless such matter,
transaction or interest is presented to, or acquired, created or developed by, or otherwise comes
into the possession of, a Covered Person directly as a result of such Covered Person’s capacity as
a director of the Corporation.

4, That the foregoing amendment and restatement was approved by the
holders of the requisite number of shares of this corporation in accordance with Section 228 of
the General Corporation Law.

which restates and integrates and further amends the provisions of this corporation’s Certificate

Corporation Law.

Incorporation has been executed by a duly authorized officer of this corporation on this 19" day
