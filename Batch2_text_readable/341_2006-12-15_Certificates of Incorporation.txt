other than in Common Stock, whether of cash, securities of other persons, evidences of
indebtedness, assets, Convertible Securities (as defined below), Stock Purchase Rights (as

“Original Price’) per share of Preferred Stock then held by it, plus any declared but unpaid
dividends pursuant to Section B.i(b) for each share of Preferred Stock and, in the case of the
Series C Preferred Stock, any Accrued Dividends that are then unpaid for each share of Series C

shares). The holders of Series C Preferred Stock shall ratably receive their respective Preference
Amount prior to and in preference to the Junior Preferred and no distributions may be made to
any holders of Junior Preferred pursuant to this Section 2(a) unless and until the Preference
Amount for the Series C Preferred Stock has been paid in full. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
the amount to be distributed to the Corporation’s stockholders upon such Liquidating Event,
assuming full exercise or conversion of all outstanding securities exercisable for or convertible
into Common Stock, would equal or exceed ten dollars ($10.00) per share of Preferred Stock for
all series of Preferred Stock, subject fo appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend,
stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization affecting such shares (“Qualifying
Liquidation Amount’), then the holders of Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to receive the
Preference Amount and shall instead receive only their ratable share of the Corporation’s assets
pursuant to Subsection 2(b) below as if such shares of Preferred Stock had been converted
voluntarily into Common Stock at the then applicable conversion rate immediately prior to such

Liquidating Event.

(b) Written notice of any such Liquidating Event stating a payment date, the
place where such payment shall be made, the amount of each payment in liquidation and the
amount of dividends to be paid shall be given by first class mail, postage prepaid, not less than

Stock at such holder’s address as shown in the records of the Corporation, provided that any
holder of Preferred Stock may convert its shares of Preferred Stock to Common Stock during
such period at any time prior to the payment date stated in such notice. If upon the occurrence of
a Liquidating Event, the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders
shall be insufficient to pay the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock the full Preference
Amount to which they shail be entitled, the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock shall share
ratably in any distribution of assets (so that each holder of Series C Preferred Stock receives the
same percentage of the applicable Preference Amount per share). After payment has been made
to the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock of the full Preference Amount to which they shall
be entitled as aforesaid, holders of the Junior Preferred shall be entitled to receive the Preference
Amount on such shares of Junior Preferred. If upon the occurrence of a Liquidating Event, the
assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders shall be insufficient to pay

286073 vI4/RE . 4

the holders of the Junior Preferred the full Preference Amount to which they shall be entitled, the
holders of the Junior Preferred shall share ratably in any distribution of assets (so that each
holder of Junior Preferred receives the same percentage of the applicable Preference Amount per
share). After payment has been made to the holders of the Preferred Stock of the full Preference
Amount to which they shall be entitled as aforesaid, any remaining assets shall be distributed
ratably among the holders of the Corporation’s Common Stock and Preferred Stock as if such
shares of Preferred Stock had been converted voluntarily into Common Stock immediately prior
to such Liquidating Event.

winding up of the Corporation, either voluntary or involuntary, or (ii) a sale, transfer, exclusive

license or other disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Corporation to, or a merger

holders (collectively, the “Approval Threshold’) and (ii) the holders of a majority of the shares
of Junior Preferred, in each case given before the effective date of a merger or consolidation that
would otherwise be a Liquidating Event as defined herein, then such merger or consolidation
shall not be deemed a Liquidating Event and the provisions of Subsections 5(g) and 6(b) shall
apply. Upon the occurrence of any Liquidating Event that would involve the distribution of

assets other than cash with respect to the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, the value of such -

non-cash assets shall be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. “Purchase

insufficient legally available funds shall continue to be outstanding and entitled to the dividend,
conversion and other rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of such applicable Preferred
Stock until such shares have been redeemed and the Redemption Price has been paid or set aside
thereto. At any time thereafter when additional funds of the Corporation are legally available for
the redemption of shares of applicable Preferred Stock, such funds will immediately be used to

required by it), accompanied by written notice stating that the holder elects to convert all or a
number of such shares represented by the certificate or certificates. Such notice shall also state
such holder’s name or the names of the nominees in which such holder wishes the certificate or
certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued. Conversion shall be deemed to have been
effected on the date when such delivery is made, and such date is referred to herein as the
“Conversion Date.” As promptly as practicable thereafter the Corporation shall issue and
deliver to such holder, at such office or other place designated by the Corporation, a certificate or
certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled and a
check for cash with respect to any fractional interest in a share of Common Stock as provided in
Subsection 5(c). The holder shall be deemed to have become a stockholder of record on the
applicable Conversion Date. Upon conversion of only a portion of the number of shares of
Preferred Stock represented by a certificate surrendered for conversion, the Corporation shall
issue and deliver to the holder of the certificate so surrendered for conversion, at the expense of
the Corporation, a new certificate covering the number of shares of Preferred Stock representing
the unconverted portion of the certificate so surrendered.

(c) No fractional shares of Common Stock or scrip shall be issued upon
conversion of shares of Preferred Stock. If more than one share of Preferred Stock shall be
surrendered for conversion at any one time by the same holder, the number of full shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof shail be computed on the basis of the aggregate
number of shares of Preferred Stock so surrendered. Instead of any fractional shares of Common
Stock that would otherwise be issuable upon conversion of any shares of Preferred Stock, the
Corporation shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fractional interest equal to the fair
market value of such fractional interest as determined in good faith by the Corporation’s Board

of Directors.

(d) The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and other taxes that may be
payable in respect of any issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock on conversion of
Preferred Stock pursuant hereto. The Corporation shall not, however, be required to pay amy tax
that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of shares of
Common Stock in a name other than that in which the Preferred Stock so converted was
registered, and no such issue or delivery shall be made unless and until the person requesting
such issue has paid to the Corporation the amount of any such tax or has established, to the
satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax has been paid. Additionally, the Corporation shall
in no event be required to pay any personal income tax that may accrue to a holder of Preferred
Stock upon conversion of Preferred Stock to shares of Common Stock.

(e) The Corporation shail at all times reserve and keep available, out of its
authorized but unissued Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of
Preferred Stock, the full number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon the conversion of
all Preferred Stock from time to time outstanding. The Corporation shall from time to time use
its best effort to obtain necessary director and stockholder approvals, in accordance with the laws
of the State of Delaware, to increase the authorized amount of its Common Stock if at any time
the authorized amount of its Common Stock remaining unissued shall not be sufficient to permit

286073 v14/RE 11

the conversion.of all of the shares of Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, and shall take all
such actions as are necessary to increase such authorized amount of Common Stock upon
obtaining such approvals. Before taking any action that would cause an adjustment reducing the.
applicable Conversion Price below the then-par value of the shares of Common Stock issuable
upon the conversion of Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take any corporate action that may,
in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Corporation may validly and legally
issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock at such applicable adjusted
Conversion Price.

(f) If the Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of Preferred Stock
shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock,
whether by capital reorganization, reclassification, or otherwise (other than a subdivision or.
combination of shares or stock dividend provided for in Subsection 6(a)), then, and in each such
event, the holder of each share of Preferred Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such
share into the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property receivable
upon such reorganization, reclassification, or other change, by holders of the number of shares of
Common Stock into which such shares of Preferred Stock might have been converted
immediately prior to such reorganization, reclassification, or change.

(g} In case of any consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into
another corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation to
another corporation (other than a consolidation, merger or sale treated as a Liquidating Event
pursuant to Subsection 2(c) above), each share of Preferred Stock shall thereafter be convertible
into the kind and amount of shares of stock or other securities or property that a holder of the
number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation deliverable upon conversion of Preferred
Stock would have been entitled upon such consolidation, merger or sale; and in such case,
appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) shall be made in
the application of the provisions of Sections 5 and 6 with respect to the rights and interest
thereafter of the holders of Preferred Stock, to the end that the provisions set forth in Sections 5
and 6 shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably-may be, in relation to any shares of
stock or other property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of Preferred Stock.

(h) ~=If any shares of Common Stock to be reserved for the purpose of
conversion of shares of Preferred Stock require registration or listing with, or approval of, any
governmental authority, stock exchange or other regulatory body under any federal or state law
or regulation or otherwise, before such shares may be validly issued or delivered upon
conversion, the Corporation will in good faith and as expeditiously as possible endeavor to
secure such registration, listing or approval, as the case may be.

(i) All shares of Common Stock that may be issued upon conversion of the
shares of Preferred Stock will, upon issuance by the Corporation, be validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable and free from all taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issuance thereof.

(Gj) In case any shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted pursuant to
Sections 5 or 6 hereof, the shares so converted shall resume the status of authorized but unissued

shares of Preferred Stock.

286073 V14/RE 12

| {k) The Corporation will not, by amendment of its Certificate of Incorporation
or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale
of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance
of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Corporation, but will at all
times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all of the provisions of Sections 5 and 6 and in the
taking of ali such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the conversion
rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock against impairment, provided that the Corporation
may amend its Certificate of Incorporation or enter into any reorganization, transfer of assets,
consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action upon
approval as required by Sections 4(b) and 4(c), if reasonable provisions have been made with
respect to the rights of the Preferred Stock.

6. Adjustment of Conversion Price |

The Conversion Price from time to time in effect shall be subject to adjustment from time
to time as follows.

(2) Stock Splits, Dividends and Combinations. In case the Corporation shall

at any time subdivide the outstanding shares of Common Stock or shall issue a dividend in
Common Stock on its outstanding Common Stock, in each case without a corresponding
adjustment to any series of Preferred Stock, the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred
Stock in effect immediately prior to such subdivision or the issuance of such dividend shall be
proportionately decreased, and in case the Corporation shall at any time combine the outstanding
shares of Common Stock into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, without a
corresponding adjustment to any series of Preferred Stock, the Conversion Price for such series
of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such combination shall be proportionately
increased, concurrently with the effectiveness of such subdivision, dividend or combination, as

the case may be.

(b) Noncash Dividends, Stock Purchase Rights, Capital Reorganizations and

Dissolutions. In case:

. — (a) the Corporation shall take a record of the holders of its Common
Stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend or any other distribution,
payable otherwise than in cash; or

(b) the Corporation shall take a record of the holders of its Common
Stock for the purpose of entitling them to subscribe for or purchase any shares of stock of
any class or to receive any other rights; or

{c) of any capital reorganization of the Corporation, reclassification of
the capital stock of the Corporation (other than a subdivision or combination of its
outstanding shares of Common Stock), consolidation or merger of the Corporation with
or into another Corporation that is not a Liquidating Event or conveyance of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Corporation to another Corporation that is not a
Liquidating Event;

286073 vI4/RE 13

then, and in any such case, the Corporation shall cause to be mailed to the transfer agent for the:
Preferred Stock and to the holders of record of the outstanding Preferred Stock, at least 20 days
prior to the date hereinafter specified, a notice stating the date on which (i) a record is to be taken
for the purpose of ‘such dividend, distribution or rights or (ii) such reclassification,
reorganization, consolidation, merger, conveyance, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is to
take place and the date, if any is to be fixed, as of which holders of Common Stock of record
shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock for securities or other property
deliverable upon such reclassification, reorganization, consolidation, merger, conveyance, -
dissolution, liquidation or winding up.

(c)  Issuances at Less Than the Conversion Price. Upon the issuance or sale
by the Corporation of:

(a) Common Stock for a consideration per share less than the
respective Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the time of such issue or sale;

or

(b) any Stock Purchase Rights where the consideration per share for
which shares of Common Stock may at any time thereafter be issuable upon exercise
thereof (or, in the case of Stock Purchase Rights exercisable for the purchase of
Convertible Securities, upon the subsequent conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities) shall be less than the respective Conversion Price in effect immediately prior
to the time of the issue or sale of such Stock Purchase Rights; or

(c} any Convertible Securities where the consideration per share for
which shares of Common Stock may at any time thereafter be issuable pursuant to the
terms of such Convertible Securities shall be less than the respective Conversion Price in
effect immediately prior to the time of the issue or sale of such Convertible Securities:

- other than an issuance of Common Stock, Stock Purchase Rights or Convertible Securities
pursuant to Subsections 6(a) or 6(d)(6) hereof (any such issuance shall be referred to hereinafter
as a “Dilutive Issuance’’), then forthwith upon such issue or sale, the Conversion Price for such
series of Preferred Stock shall be reduced to a price (calculated to the nearest cent) determined

by the following formula:

N+A8S
where:
CP! = the Conversion Price as so adjusted;

CP = the former Conversion Price;

the number of shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock (on an as-
converted basis) outstanding immediately prior to such issuance; -

4
ti

286073 v14/RE 14

C = the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration
' yeceived or deemed to be received by the Corporation for the total number

of additional securities so issued or deemed to be issued would purchase if
the purchase price per share were equal to the then-existing Conversion

Price;
AS = the number of shares of Common Stock so issued or deemed to be issued.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Conversion Price shail not be reduced at such time if such
reduction would be an amount less than $.01, but any such amount shall be carried forward and
deduction with respect thereto made at the time of and together with any subsequent reduction
that, together with such amount and any other amount or amounts so carried forward, shall

aggregate $.01 or more.

In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, any adjustments to the conversion price of the Junior
Preferred that is caused by the issuance of the Series C Preferred Stock shall be calculated only
on the basis of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock actually issued by the Corporation in
accordance with the Purchase Agreement. .

(d) ‘For purposes of this Section 6, the following provisions will be applicable:

(1) “Convertible Securities” shall mean evidences of indebtedness,
shares of stock (including, without limitation, the Preferred Stock) or other securities that
are convertible into or exchangeable for, with or without payment of additional
consideration, shares of Common Stock.

(2) “Stock Purchase Rights” shall mean any warrants, options or other
rights to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of Common Stock or
any Convertible Securities.

(3) Convertible Securities and Stock Purchase Rights shall be deemed
outstanding and issued or sold at the time of such issue or sale.

(4) Determination of Consideration. The “consideration actually
received” by the Corporation for the issuance, sale, grant or assumption of shares of
Common Stock, Stock Purchase Rights or Convertible Securities, irrespective of the
accounting treatment of such consideration, shall be valued as follows:

i) Cash Payment. In the case of cash, the net amount received
by the Corporation after deduction of any accrued interest or dividends and before
deducting any expenses paid or incurred and any underwriting commissions or
concessions paid or allowed by the Corporation in connection with such issue or
sale:

ii) Noncash Payment. In the case of consideration other than
cash, the value of such consideration, including the value of any loan made in
connection with the issuance of Stock Purchase Rights or Convertible Securities,
which shall not include the value of any Convertible Securities of the Corporation

286073 vl4/RE 15

being converted or exchanged, as determined by the Board of Directors in good
faith, after deducting any accrued interest or dividends; and

iit) | Stock Purchase Rights and Convertible Securities. The

total consideration, if any, received by the Corporation as consideration for the
issuance of the Stock Purchase Rights or the Convertible Securities, as the case
may be, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any,
payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such Stock Purchase Rights or
upon the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, as the case may
be, in each case after deducting any accrued interest or dividends. Where as part
of the same transaction or series of related transactions occurring within a sixty
(60) day period more than one type of Convertible Securities and/or Stock
Purchase Rights or both Convertible Securities and Stock Purchase Rights are
issued, the determination as to whether a Dilutive Issuance has occurred shail be
made on an aggregate basis, taking into account all Convertible Securities and all
Siock Purchase Rights whose conversion or exercise are conditioned on the
conversion or exercise of the other Convertible Securities and Stock Purchase

Rights.
(5) Readjustment of Conversion Price. In the event of any change in

(i) the consideration, if any, payable upon exercise of any Stock Purchase Rights or upon
the conversion or exchange of any Convertible Securities (including additional
consideration paid to extend the term or to change another provision of the Stock
Purchase Rights or Convertible Securities or required as a condition of exercise or
conversion) or (ii) the rate at which any Convertible Securities are convertible into or
exchangeable for shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price as computed upon the
original issue thereof shall forthwith be readjusted to the Conversion Price that would
have been in effect at such time had such Stock Purchase Rights or Convertible Securities
provided for such changed purchase price, consideration or conversion rate, as the case
may be, at the time initially granted, issued or sold. On the expiration of any Stock
Purchase Rights not exercised or of any right to convert or exchange under any
Convertible Securities not exercised, the Conversion Price then in effect shall forthwith
be increased to the Conversion Price that would have been in effect at the time of such
expiration had such Stock Purchase Rights or Convertible Securities never been issued.
No readjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Subsection 6(d)(5) shall (i)
increase the applicable Conversion Price by an amount in excess of the adjustment
originally made to the Conversion Price in respect of the issue, sale or grant of the
applicable Stock Purchase Rights or Convertible Securities or (ii) require any adjustment
to the amount paid or number of shares of Common Stock received by any holder of
Preferred Stock upon any conversion of any share of Preferred Stock prior to the date
upon which such readjustment to the Conversion Price shall occur.

(6) Exclusions. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the
Corporation shall not be required to make any adjustment of the Conversion Price in the
case of (i) the issuance or sale of Common Stock or of options, or the shares of stock
issuable upon exercise of such options, to purchase up to Three Million Five Hundred
One Thousand Hight Hundred Sixty-Nine ( 3,501,869) shares of Common Stock granted

286073 vI4/RE 16

after the date hereof (together with the exercise of up to 2,447,131 shares of Common
Stock issuable for options granted prior to the date hereof), subject to adjustment for
stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations and the like, to directors, officers,
employees or consultants of the Corporation pursuant to stock options or stock purchase
plans or agreements, whether “qualified” for tax purposes or not, pursuant to plans or
arrangements approved by the Board of Directors, (ii) the issuance or sale of any other
shares of Common Stock, Convertible Securities or Stock Purchase Rights as to which
the holders of two-thirds (66-2/3%) of the outstanding shares of Junior Preferred and the
Approval Threshold of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock have expressly
waived such adjustment to the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 6, (iii) the
issuance of Common Stock upon conversion of the Preferred Stock, (iv) any dividends or
distributions on Preferred Stock, (v) the issuance of warrants to purchase shares of
Common Stock to banks or equipment lessors, as approved by the Board of Directors,
such issuances not to exceed in the aggregate one percent (1%) of the outstanding shares
of Common Stock of the Corporation on a fully-diluted, as-converted into Common
Stock basis, (vi) the issuance of shares of Common Stock, Convertible Securities, or
Stock Purchase Rights in connection with business combinations or corporate partnering
agreements, as approved by the Board of Directors, such issuances not to exceed in the
aggregate five percent (5%) of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the
Corporation on a fully-diluted, as-converted into Common Stock basis, (vii) the sale of
shares of Common Stock in connection with a Qualified IPO, or (viii) solely with respect
to the Junior Preferred, any issuance or deemed issuance of Common Stock, Convertible
Securities or Stock Purchase Rights other than shares of Series C Preferred Stock issued
in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement. The issuances or sales
described in the preceding clauses (1), (il), {iii}, (iv), (v), (vt), (vil) and (vili) (solely with
respect to the Junior Preferred) shall be ignored for purposes of calculating any
adjustment to any Conversion Price.

(7) Notice of Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment
or readjustment of the applicable Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 6, the
Corporation at its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in
accordance with the terms thereof, and prepare and furnish to each holder of Preferred
Stock affected thereby a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and
showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The
Corporation shall, upon the written notice at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock
furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such
adjustment or readjustment, (#i) the applicable Conversion Price at the time in effect and
ii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property that
at the time would be received upon the conversion of such hoider’s shares.

7. Mandatory Conversion

Each share of each applicable series of Preferred Stock shall automatically be
converted into shares of Common Stock at the then-applicable conversion rate upon the
occurrence of (1) a Qualified IPO, (2) for the conversion of Junior Preferred, the affirmative vote
of the holders of at least two-thirds (66-2/3%) the then-outstanding shares of Junior Preferred,
voting together as a single class, or (3) for the conversion of Series C Preferred, the affirmative

286073 v14/RE 17

vote of the Approval Threshold (the “Conversion Event’). Immediately upon the occurrence of
a Conversion Event, the Preferred Stock shall cease to have any rights of Preferred Stock and
shall instead have the rights attributable to the shares of Common Stock into which the Preferred
Stock is automatically converted, whether or not Preferred Stock certificates have been
exchanged for Common Stock certificates. All hoiders of record of shares of Preferred Stock will
be given at least ten (10) days prior written notice of the estimated earliest date upon which
mandatory conversion of the Preferred Stock could occur and the event constituting the
Conversion Event. Such notice shall be sent by first class mail, postage prepaid, to each holder of
record of Preferred Stock at such holder’s address as shown in the records of the Corporation.
Each holder of shares of the Preferred Stock shali surrender the certificate or certificates for all
such shares to the Corporation at the place designated in such notice and shall thereafter receive
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled. The:
mechanics for conversion and other provisions relating to conversion of Preferred Stock ‘into
Common Stock set forth elsewhere in this Certificate of Incorporation shall apply to the
mandatory conversion of the Preferred Stock.

8. Special Mandatory Conversion.

(a) In the event that the Milestones (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) have been
agreed to have been achieved (as determined in accordance with Section 2.4 of the Purchase
Agreement) and any holder of shares of Series C Preferred Stock (or an affiliate of such holder)
does not at such Second Closing, purchase all of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock required
to be purchased by such holder pursuant to Section 2.4 of the Purchase Agreement (a “Purchase
Default’), then effective upon, subject to, and concurrently with, the consummation of the
Second Closing all shares of Series C Preferred Stock held by such holder shall automatically,
and without any further action on the part of such holder, be converted into shares of Common
Stock in accordance with this Section 8... Upon such Purchase Default, any shares of Series C
Preferred Stock so converted shall be cancelled and not subject to reissuance

(>) Upon a Purchase Default, each holder of shares of Series C Preferred Stock .
converted pursuant to Section 8(a) shall surrender his, her or its certificate or certificates for all
such shares to the Corporation at the place designated in the notice of conversion delivered by
the Corporation, and shall thereafter receive certificates for the number of shares of Common |
Stock at a rate equal to 1/10 of the Series C Conversion Price. All rights with respect to the
Series C Preferred Stock converted pursuant to Section 8(a), including the rights, if any, to
receive notices and vote, will terminate, except only the rights of the holders thereof, upon
surrender of their certificate or certificates therefor, to receive certificates for the number of
shares of Common Stock into which such Series C Preferred Stock has been converted. If so
required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or
accompanied by written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the
Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or by his, her or its attorney duly authorized
in writing. As soon as practicable after the Purchase Default and the surrender of the certificate
or certificates for Series C Preferred Stock so converted, the Corporation shall cause to be issued
and delivered to such holder, or on his, her or its written order, a certificate or certificates for the
number of shares of Common Stock issuable on such conversion in accordance with the
provisions hereof.

286073 v14/RE 18

(c}) All certificates evidencing shares of Series C Preferred Stock which are required
to be surrendered for conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof shall, from and after
the time of the Purchase Default, be deemed to have been retired and cancelled, and the shares of
Series C Preferred Stock converted pursuant to Section 8(a) represented thereby shall, from and
after the time of the Purchase Default, be deemed to have been converted into Common Stock
for all purposes, notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender such.
certificates on or prior to such date. The Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate action
(without the need for stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number:
of shares of Series C Preferred Stock accordingly.
