Stock in proportion to the full Preferred Liquidation Preference that each such holder is
otherwise entitled to receive.

remaining Available Assets shall be distributed ratably among the holders of shares of Common
Stock and the holders of Preferred Stock (determined as if the holders of Preferred Stock had
converted such stock to Common Stock using the then applicable Conversion Price).

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the foregoing, in
the event of a Sale Transaction, by affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of at least a
majority of the Preferred Stock then outstanding, voting together as a single class on an as-
converted basis (the “Preferred Majority”) such holders may elect, on behalf of all (but not less
than all) of the holders of shares of Preferred Stock (1) to waive the right to treat such Sale
Transaction as a Liquidation Event and (2) to receive, in lieu of the benefits of a Liquidation
Event pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph 4, the benefits of the provisions of paragraph
6(i). Such election shall be binding upon all holders of shares of Preferred Stock. Such election

than five (5) days before the closing of such Sale Transaction or the Company and the holders of
a majority of the Preferred Stock waive such notice requirement.

(d) If any assets of the Company distributed to stockholders in connection
with a Liquidation Event are other than cash, then the value of such assets shall be their fair
market value as determined in good faith by the Board, except that any securities to be
distributed to stockholders in connection with a Liquidation Event shall be valued as follows,
unless otherwise determined by the Board, including a majority of the directors designated by the
holders of Preferred Stock:

(1) The method of valuation of securities not subject to investment
letter or other similar restrictions on free marketability shall be as follows:

(A) _ if the securities are then traded on a national securities
exchange, the Nasdaq National Market System (or a similar national
quotation system) or the Nasdaq Small Cap Market, then the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such
exchange or system over the thirty (30)-day period ending three (3) days
prior to the distribution;

(B) if actively traded over-the-counter, then the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing bid prices over the thirty (30)-day
period ending three (3) days prior to the closing of such merger,
consolidation or sale; and

(C) if there is no active public market then the value shall be
the fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board.

(2) The method of valuation of securities subject to investment letter
or other similar restrictions on free marketability shall be to make an appropriate
discount from the market value determined as above in (A), (B) or (C) of
paragraph (1) to reflect the approximate fair market value thereof, as determined
in good faith by the Board.

5. Voting Rights.

(a) Preferred Stock. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or as
required by law, the holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to vote on all matters upon which
holders of Common Stock have the right to vote, and with respect to such vote shall be entitled
to notice of any stockholders meeting in accordance with the Bylaws of the Company, and shall
be entitled to a number of votes equal to the largest number of full shares of Common Stock into
which such shares of Preferred Stock could then be converted, pursuant to the provisions of
paragraph 6 hereof. Such number of votes shall be determined, in each case, at the record date
for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote on such matters or, if no such record date is
established, at the date such vote is taken or any written consent of stockholders is solicited.

(bo) Election of Directors. The number of directors of the Company shall
initially be seven, subject to any further restrictions as may be set forth in this Certificate of
Incorporation.

(1) The holders of Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, shall be
entitled to elect three members of the Board at each meeting or pursuant to each
consent of the Company’s stockholders for the election of directors, and to
remove from office such director and to fill any vacancy caused by the
resignation, death or removal of such director(s).

(2) The holders of Common Stock and the holders of Preferred Stock,
voting together as a single class on an as-if-converted basis, shall be entitled to
elect all remaining members of the Board at each meeting or pursuant to each
consent of the Company’s stockholders for the election of directors, and to

remove from office such directors and to fill any vacancy caused by the
resignation, death or removal of such director(s).

(c) General. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or to the extent
class or series voting is otherwise required by law or agreement, the holders of Preferred Stock
and Common Stock shall vote together as a single class and not as separate classes on all matters.

6. Conversion.

The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have the following conversion rights:

6
(a) Right to Convert.

(1) Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of
the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share, at the
office of the Company or any transfer agent for Common Stock, into fully paid
and nonassessable shares of Common Stock, at the applicable Conversion Price
then in effect.

(2) Before any holder of shares of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
convert the same into shares of Common Stock, the holder shall surrender the
certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Company or
of any transfer agent for the Common Stock and shall give written notice to the
Company at such office that such holder elects to convert the same and shall state
therein the number of shares of Preferred Stock being converted and the name or
names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock are to
be issued at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date of such conversion unless such
notice requirement is waived by the Company. Thereupon the Company shall
promptly issue and deliver at such office to such holder or to the nominee or
nominees of such holder a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of
Common Stock to which such holder shal! be entitled.

(3) Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately
prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender for conversion of the
shares of Preferred Stock, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares
of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes
as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date.

(6) Automatic Conversion.

(1) | Each share of Preferred Stock which is outstanding immediately
prior to the closing of a Qualified Initial Public Offering shall automatically, and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof or the Company, be converted,
effective immediately prior to the closing of a Qualified Initial Public Offering,
on the same basis and at the same Conversion Price as if each holder thereof had
properly exercised such holder’s right to convert on the day preceding the Closing
Date.

(2) At the election of holders of at least a majority of the then
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class on an as-
converted basis, upon not less than fifteen (15) days notice to the Company, all
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall automatically, and without any
additional action on the part of the holders thereof or the Company, be converted,
effective as of the close of business on the date specified in such notice (which
date shall be not more than sixty (60) days following the date of such notice), on
the same basis and at the same Conversion Price as if each holder thereof had
properly exercised such holder’s right to convert on the day preceding such date.
(3) The Company shall have no obligation to issue and deliver to any
holder of Preferred Stock a certificate for the number of shares of Common Stock
to which such holder shall otherwise be entitled upon conversion hereunder until
such time as such holder has surrendered such holder’s certificate or certificates
for such holder’s Preferred Stock, duly endorsed, at the office of the Company or
any transfer agent for the Common Stock or the holder notifies the Company that
such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement
satisfactory to the Company to indemnify the Company from any loss incurred by
it in connection therewith. All rights with respect to shares of Preferred Stock
outstanding on the date of conversion shall forthwith after such date terminate,
except only the nght of the holders of such shares to receive Common Stock upon
surrender of their certificates for Preferred Stock.

(c) Conversion Price.

(1) Each share of Series A Stock shall be convertible into the number
of shares of Common Stock that results from dividing the Series A-1 Original
Issue Price by the Series A-1 Conversion Price in effect at the time of conversion.

(2) Each share of Series B Stock shall be convertible into the number
of shares of Common Stock that results from dividing the Series B Original Issue
Price by the Series B Conversion Price in effect at the time of conversion.

(d) Forfeiture of Dividends on Conversion. In the event of a conversion of
Preferred Stock into Common Stock pursuant to paragraphs 6(a) or 6(b), any accrued but unpaid
dividends (whether or not declared) on the shares of Preferred Stock being converted shall be
forfeited.

(ec) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If the Company shall at
any time or from time to time after the applicable Original Issue Date effect a subdivision of the
outstanding Common Stock without a corresponding subdivision of the outstanding Preferred
Stock, each applicable Conversion Price then in effect immediately before that subdivision shall
be proportionately decreased; conversely, if the Company shall at any time or from time to time
after the applicable Original Issue Date reduce the outstanding shares of Common Stock by
combination or otherwise without a corresponding combination of the outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock, each applicable Conversion Price then in effect immediately before the
combination shall be proportionately increased. Any adjustment under this paragraph 6(e) shall
become effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes
effective.

(f) Adjustment_for Certain Dividends and Distributions. In the event the
Company at any time or from time to time after the Series B Original Issue Date shall make or

issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive a
dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock, then and in each
such event the applicable Conversion Price for the Preferred Stock then in effect shall be
decreased as of the time of such issuance or, in the event such a record date shall have been
fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, by multiplying the applicable Conversion
Price for each of the Preferred Stock then in effect by a fraction:

(1) the numerator of which shail be the total number of shares of
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such
issuance or the close of business on such record date; and

(2) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such
issuance or the close of business on such record date, plus the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution;

provided, however, if such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend is not fully paid
or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the applicable Conversion
Price for the Preferred Stock shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such
record date and thereafter the applicable Conversion Price for each series of the Preferred Stock
shall be adjusted pursuant to this paragraph 6(f) as of the time of actual payment of such
dividends or distributions.

(g) Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. In the event the
Company at any time or from time to time after the Series B Original Issue Date shall make or
issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive,
a dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the Company other than shares of
Common Stock, then and in each such event provision shall be made so that the holders of
Preferred Stock shall receive upon conversion thereof, in addition to the number of shares of
Common Stock receivable thereupon, the amount of securities of the Company that they would
have received had such shares of Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock on the date
of such event and had thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to and including
date of conversion, retained such securities receivable by them as aforesaid during such period
giving application to ali adjustments called for during such period under this paragraph 6 with
respect to the rights of the holders of Preferred Stock.

(h) Adjustment for Reclassification Exchange or Substitution. If the Common
Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or

different number of shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization,
reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares or stock dividend
provided for above, or a reorganization or Sale Transaction provided for elsewhere in this
paragraph 6), then and in each such event the holder of each share of Preferred Stock shall have
the right thereafter to convert such share into the kind and amounts of shares of stock and other
securities and property receivable upon such reorganization, reclassification or other change, by
holders of the numbers of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Preferred Stock
might have been converted immediately prior to such reorganization, reclassification or change,
all subject to further adjustment as provided herein.

(i) Adjustment for Reorganization, Mergers, Consolidations or Sales of
Assets. If at any time or from time to time there shall be a capital reorganization of the Common

Stock (other than a subdivision, combination, reclassification or exchange of shares provided for
elsewhere in this paragraph 6) or a Sale Transaction to which the provisions of paragraph 4
hereof do not apply, and if as a part of such reorganization or Sale Transaction the Preferred
Stock is not cancelled, exchanged, redeemed or otherwise retired, then provision shall be made
so that each holder of shares of Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon
conversion of the Preferred Stock the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of
the Company, or of the successor corporation resulting from such Sale Transaction to which a
holder of that number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of such shares of
Preferred Stock would have been entitled on such capital reorganization or Sale Transaction. In
any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this
paragraph 6 with respect to the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock after the
reorganization or Sale Transaction to the end that the provisions of this paragraph 6 (including
adjustment of the applicable Conversion Price then in effect and the number of shares
purchasable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event as nearly
equivalent as may be practicable.

(j) Sale of Shares Below Conversion Price.

(1) = Ifat any time or from time to time after the Series B Original Issue
Date, the Company shall issue or sell, or is deemed by the express provisions of
paragraph (3) of this paragraph 6(j) to have issued or sold, Additional Shares of
Common Stock, other than as a dividend as provided in paragraphs 6(f) or 6(g)
above, and other than upon a subdivision or combination of shares of Common
Stock as provided in paragraph 6(e) above, for a consideration per share less than
the Conversion Price then in effect for a series of Preferred Stock then the
applicable Conversion Price then in effect for such series of Preferred Stock shall
be reduced as of the opening of business on the date of such issue or sale, to a
price (calculated to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying the then
applicable Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock by a fraction (A)
the numerator of which shall be (i) the total number of shares of Shares Deemed
Outstanding, plus (ii) the total number of shares of Common Stock that the
aggregate consideration received by the Company for the total number of
Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued would purchase at the Conversion
Price applicable to such series of Preferred Stock before this adjustment, and (B)
the denominator of which shall be (i) the total number of shares of Shares
Deemed Outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale, plus (ii) the number
of such Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued.

In the event that the number of shares of Additional Shares of Common Stock or
the aggregate consideration for such number of Additional Shares of Common
Stock cannot be ascertained at the time of issuance, such Additional Shares of
Common Stock shall be deemed issued immediately upon the occurrence of the
first event that makes such number of shares or the aggregate consideration, as
applicable, determinable.

(2) For the purpose of making any adjustment in the applicable

Conversion Price or number of shares of Common Stock purchasable on
conversion of Preferred Stock as provided above, the consideration received by

10
the Company for any issue or sale of securities shall, for the purpose of this
paragraph 6(j)(2):

(A) to the extent it consists of cash, be computed at the net
amount of cash received by the Company after deduction of any
underwriting or similar commissions, concessions or compensation paid or
allowed by the Company in connection with such issue or sale;

(B) to the extent it consists of services or property other than
cash, be computed at the fair value of such services or property as
determined in good faith by the Board; and

(C) if Additional Shares of Common Stock, Convertible
Securities (as hereinafter defined), or rights or options to purchase either
Additional Shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities are issued
or sold together with other stock or securities or other assets of the
Company for a consideration that covers both, be computed as the portion
of the consideration so received that may be reasonably determined in
good faith by the Board to be allocable to such Additional Shares of
Common Stock, Convertible Securities, rights or options.

(3) For the purpose of the adjustment provided in subsection (1) of this
paragraph 6(j), if at any time or from time to time after the Series B Original Issue
Date the Company shall issue any warrants, options or other rights for the
purchase of, or stock or other securities convertible into, Additional Shares of
Common Stock (such convertible stock or securities being hereinafter referred to
as “Convertible Securities”), then in each case, if the Effective Price (as
hereinafter defined) of such warrants, options, rights or Convertible Securities
shall be less than the then applicable Conversion Price for a series of Preferred
Stock, the Company shall be deemed to have issued at the time of the issuance of
such warrants, options, rights or Convertible Securities the maximum number of
Additional Shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise or conversion thereof
and to have received as consideration for the issuance of such shares an amount
equal to the total amount of the consideration, if any, received by the Company
for the issuance of such warrants, options, rights or Convertible Securities, plus,
in the case of such warrants, options, or rights, the minimum amounts of
consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon exercise or conversion of
such warrants, options, or rights. For purposes of the foregoing, “Effective Price”
shall mean the quotient determined by dividing the total of all such consideration
by such maximum number of Additional Shares of Common Stock. No further
adjustment of the applicable Conversion Price adjusted upon the issuance of such
warrants, options, rights or Convertible Securities shall be made as a result of the
actual issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock on the exercise of any
such warrants, options, or rights or the conversion of any such Convertible
Securities.
If any such warrants, options, or rights or the conversion privilege represented by
any such Convertible Securities shall expire without having been exercised, the
applicable Conversion Price adjusted upon the issuance of such warrants, options, rights
or Convertible Securities shall be readjusted to the applicable Conversion Price that
would have been in effect had an adjustment been made on the basis that the only
Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued were the Additional Shares of Common
Stock, if any, actually issued or sold on the exercise of such warrants, options, or rights,
or rights of conversion of such Convertible Securities, and such Additional Shares of
Common Stock, if any, were issued or sold for the consideration actually received by the
Company upon such exercise, plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the
Company for the granting of all such warrants, options, and rights, whether or not
exercised, plus the consideration received for issuing or selling the Convertible Securities
actually converted plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the Company on
the conversion of such Convertible Securities.

(4) For the purpose of the adjustment provided for in subsection (1) of
this paragraph 6(j), if at any time or from time to time after the Series A-] Original
Issue Date the Company shall issue any rights or options for the purchase of
Convertible Securities, then in each such case, if the Effective Price thereof is less
than the current applicable Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock, the
Company shall be deemed to have issued at the time of the issuance of such rights
or options the maximum number of Additional Shares of Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of the total amount of Convertible Securities covered by such
rights or options and to have received as consideration for the issuance of such
Additional Shares of Common Stock an amount equal to the amount of
consideration, if any, received by the Company for the issuance of such rights or
options, plus the minimum amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the
Company upon the conversion of such Convertible Securities. For the purposes of
the foregoing, ‘Effective Price” shall mean the quotient determined by dividing
the total amount of such consideration by such maximum number of Additional
Shares of Common Stock. No further adjustment of such Conversion Price
adjusted upon the issuance of such nights or options shall be made as a result of
the actual issuance of the Convertible Securities upon the exercise of such rights
or options or upon the actual issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock
upon the conversion of such Convertible Securities.

The provisions of subsection (3) above for the readjustment of such applicable
Conversion Price upon the expiration of rights or options or the rights of conversion of
Convertible Securities, shall apply mutatis mutandis to the rights, options and
Convertible Securities referred to in this subsection (4).

(k) Definition. The term “Additional Shares of Common Stock” as used

herein shall mean all shares of Common Stock issued or deemed issued by the Company after the
Series B Original Issue Date, whether or not subsequently reacquired or retired by the Company,
other than:

12

issuable based upon such adjusted applicable Conversion Price.

this paragraph 7, the Company shall purchase, and the holders of Preferred Stock as of the
applicable Redemption Date (the “Redeeming Holders”) shall sell, the Redemption Shares,

anniversary of the Redemption Date and the second anniversary of the Redemption Date, (each,
a “Redemption Closing”). The Company shall notify in writing all the holders in interest of the
then outstanding Preferred Stock of the date and place of the each Redemption Closing at least

transferred on the Company’s books and all rights of the holders of such shares with respect to
such shares shall terminate after such Redemption Closing, except only the right of the holders to
receive the applicable Redemption Price without interest upon surrender of their certificate(s)
therefor. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the foregoing, if upon any
Redemption Closing, the Company fails to remit any Redemption Payment when due, the
