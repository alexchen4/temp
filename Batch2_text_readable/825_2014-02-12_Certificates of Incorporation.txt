(c) Mechanics of Conversion.

(1) Optional Conversions. Before any holder of Series Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender
the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed (or, if such holder alleges that such
certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit reasonably acceptable to
the Company), at the office of the Company or of any transfer agent for such Series Preferred
Stock, and shall give written notice to the Company at its principal corporate office, of the
election to convert the same and shall state therein the name or names in which the certificate or
certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued. The Company shall, as soon as
practicable thereafter, (i) issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Series Preferred Stock,
or to the nominee or nominees of such holder (subject to any applicable transfer restrictions), a
certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall
be entitled as aforesaid, (ii) pay in cash such amount as provided in Section 2.3.4(d)(7)(A) in lieu
of any fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion and (iii)
pay all declared but unpaid dividends on the shares of Series Preferred Stock being converted.
Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business
on the date of such surrender of the shares of Series Preferred Stock to be converted, the rights of
the holder of the shares of Series Preferred Stock converted as a holder of Series Preferred Stock
shall cease (except the right to receive the items provided for in the immediately preceding
sentence), and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable
upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such
shares of Common Stock as of such date. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if a
conversion of Series Preferred Stock is to be made in connection with a Liquidation Transaction,
an underwritten offering of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act or a share sale
transaction or another transaction affecting the Company or a holder of Series Preferred Stock,
the conversion of any shares of Series Preferred Stock may, at the election of the holders such
shares, be conditioned upon the consummation of such event or transaction, in which case such
conversion shall not be deemed to be effective until such event or transaction has been
consummated. Such converted Series Preferred Stock shall be retired and cancelled and may not
be reissued as shares of such series, and the Company may thereafter take such appropriate
action (without the need for shareholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized
number of shares of Series Preferred Stock accordingly.

(2) Mandatory Conversions. All holders of record of shares of Series
Preferred Stock shall be sent written notice of the Mandatory Conversion Time and the place

WEST\245950135.6 12

designated for mandatory conversion of all such shares of Series Preferred Stock pursuant to
Section 2.3.4{a)(1), Such notice need not be sent in advance of the occurrence of the Mandatory
Conversion Time. Upon receipt of such notice, each holder of Series Preferred Stock shall
surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed (or, if such holder alleges that
such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit reasonably
acceptable to the Company), at the office of the Company or of any transfer agent for such Series
Preferred Stock. If so required by the Company, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be
endorsed or accompanied by written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to
the Company, duly executed by the registered holder or by his, her or its attorney duly authorized
in writing. The Company shall, as soon as practicable after the Mandatory Conversion Time and
the surrender of the certificate or certificates (or lost certificate affidavit) for Series Preferred
Stock, (i) issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Series Preferred Stock, or to the
nominee or nominees of such holder (subject to any applicable transfer restrictions), a certificate
or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled
as aforesaid, (ii) pay in cash such amount as provided in Section 2.3.4(d)(7)(A) in lieu of any
fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion and (iii) pay all
declared but unpaid dividends on the shares of Series Preferred Stock being converted. Such
conversion shall be deemed to have been made at the Mandatory Conversion Time
(notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender the certificates at or
prior to such time), the rights of the holder of the shares of Series Preferred Stock converted as a
holder of Series Preferred Stock shall cease (except the right to receive the items provided for in
the immediately preceding sentence), and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record
holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock as of the Mandatory Conversion Time. Such
converted Series Preferred Stock shall be retired and cancelled and may not be reissued as shares
of such series, and the Company may thereafter take such appropriate action (without the need
for shareholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Series
Preferred Stock accordingly.

(d) - Conversion Price Adjustments of Series Preferred Stock for Certain
Dilutive Jssuances, Splits and Combinations. The applicable Conversion Price of the Series
Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time after the date hereof, as follows:

(1) Issuance of Additional Stock below Purchase Price.

(A) . Issuances of Additional Stock. If the Company shall issue,
any Additional Stock (as defined below) for consideration per share less than the Conversion
Price applicable to a series of Series Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to the issuance
of such Additional Stock, such Conversion Price shall automatically be adjusted as set forth in
this Section 2.3.4(d)(1), unless otherwise provided in this Section 2.3.4(d)(1).

(B) Adjustment Formula. Whenever the Conversion Price is
adjusted pursuant to Section 2.3.4(d}(1)(A), the new Conversion Price shall be determined by
multiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional
Stock by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Outstanding
Common Stock (as defined below) immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares
of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received by the Company for the total

WEST\245950135.6 13

number of shares of Additional Stock so issued would purchase at the Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such issuance and (ii) the denominator of which shal! be the number of
shares of Outstanding Common Stock immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of
shares of such Additional Stock so issued. For purposes of the foregoing calculation, the term
“Outstanding Common Stock” shall mean the number of shares of Common Stock actually
issued and outstanding at the time of determination plus the number of shares of Common Stock
deemed issued at such time pursuant to Section 2.3.4(d)(1(F) below.

(C) Definition of “Additional Stock”. For purposes of this
Section 2,3.4(d)(1), “Additional Stock” shall mean any shares of Common Stock issued (or

indemnification and advancement of expenses pursuant to rights granted under, or provided by,
the Act or otherwise.

4.7. Partial Indemnification, If an Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification by the
Company for some or a portion of expenses, liabilities, or losses actually and reasonably incurred

4.9, Notification and Defense of Claim. Indemnitee shall promptly notify the Company in
writing of any Proceeding for which indemnification could be sought under this Article. In

reasonably require and as shall be within Indemnitee’s power. With respect to any such
Proceeding as to which Indemnitee has notified the Company: (a) the Company will be entitled
to participate therein at its own expense; and (b) except as otherwise provided below, to the
extent that it may wish, the Company, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly
notified, will be entitled to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to Indemnitee.
Indemnitee’s consent to such counsel may not be unreasonably withheld. After notice from the
Company to Indemnitee of its election to assume the defense, the Company will not be liable to
Indemnitee under this Article for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by
Indemnitee in connection with such defense. However, Indemnitee shall continue to have the
right to employ its counsel in such Proceeding, at Indemnitee’s expense; and if (i) the
employment of counsel by Indemnitee has been authorized by the Company, (ii) Indemnitee
shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest between the Company
and Indemnitee in the conduct of such defense, or (iii) the Company shall not in fact have
employed counsel to assume the defense of such Proceeding, then the fees and expenses of
Indemnitee’s counsel shall be at the expense of the Company. The Company shall not be
entitled to assume the defense of any Proceeding brought by or on behalf of the Company or as
to which Indemnitee shall reasonably have made the conclusion that a conflict of interest may
exist between the Company and the Indemnitee in the conduct of the defense.

WESTV245950135.6 : 23

4,10. Information to be Submitted and Method of Determination and Authorization of
Indemnification. For the purpose of pursuing rights to indemnification under this Article, the
Indemnitee shal] submit to the Board of Directors a sworn statement requesting indemnification
and reasonable evidence of all amounts for which such indemnification is requested (together,
the sworn statement and the evidence constitute an “Indemnification Statement”), Submission of
an Indemnification Statement to the Board of Directors shall create a presumption that the
Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification hereunder, and the Company shall, within sixty (60)
calendar days thereafter, make the payments requested in the Indemnification Statement to or for
the benefit of the Indemnitee, unless, within such sixty (60) calendar day period the Company
shall notify the Indemnitee in writing that the Company has determined, based upon clear and
convincing evidence, that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under this Article.
Any determination that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification, and any failure to make
the payments requested in the Indemnification Statement, shall be subject to judicial review by
any court of competent jurisdiction.

4.11, Special Procedure Regarding Advances for Expenses. An Indemnitee seeking
payment of expenses in advance of a final disposition of the Proceeding must furnish to the
Company, as part of the Indemnification Statement: (a) a written affirmation of the Indemnitee’s
good faith belief that the Indemnitee has met the standard of conduct required to be eligible for
indemnification; and (b) a written undertaking, constituting an unlimited general obligation of
the Indemnitee, to repay the advance if it is ultimately determined that the Indemnitee did not
meet the required standard of conduct. Upon satisfaction of the foregoing the Indemnitee shall
have a contractual right to the prompt payment of such expenses by the Company within ten (10)
calendar days thereafter,

4,12. Settlement. The Company shall not be liable to indemnify Indemnitee for any amounts
paid in settlement of any Proceeding without the Company’s written consent. The Company
shall not settle any Proceeding in any manner which would impose any penalty or limitation on
Indemnitee without Indemnitee’s written consent. Neither the Company nor Indemnitee may
unreasonably withhold its consent to a proposed settlement,

4.13. Contract and Related Rights,

(a) Contract Rights, The right of an Indemnitee to indemnification and
advancement of expenses is a contract right upon which the Indemnitee shall be presumed to
have relied in determining to serve or to continue to serve in his or her capacity with the
Company. Such right shall continue as long as the Indemnitee shall be subject to any possible
Proceeding. Any amendment to or repeal of this Article shall not adversely affect any right or
protection of an Indemnitee with respect to any acts or omissions of such Indemnitee occurring
prior to such amendment or repeal.

(b) Optional Insurance, Contracts, and Funding. The Company may purchase

and maintain insurance on behalf of an individual who is or was a director, officer, employee, or
Agent of the Company or, who, while a director, officer, employee, or Agent of the Company, is
or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, or
Agent of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee
benefit plan, or other enterprise against Liability asserted against or incurred by the individual in

WEST\245950135.6 24

that capacity or arising from the individual's status as a director, officer, employee, or Agent,
whether or not the Company would have power to indemnify the individual against such
Liability under RCW 23B.08.510 or 23B.08.520,

(c) Severability. If any provision or application of this Article shall be invalid
or unenforceable, the remainder of this Article and its remaining applications shall not be
affected thereby, and shall continue in full force and effect.

(d) Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit. If either (1) a claim under this Article
IV for indemnification is not paid in full by the Company within sixty (60) days after a written
claim has been received by the Company or (2) a claim under this Article IV for advancement of
expenses is not paid in full by the Company within twenty (20) days after a written claim has
been received by the Company, then the Indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against
the Company to recover the unpaid amount of the claim, To the extent successful in whole or in
part, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to also be paid the expense (to be proportionately prorated
if the Indemnitee is only partially successful) of prosecuting such claim. Neither (1) the failure
of the Company to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such Proceeding
that indemnification or reimbursement or advancement of expenses to the Indemnitee is proper
in the circumstances, nor (2) an actual determination by the Company that the Indemnitee is not
entitled to indemnification or to the reimbursement or advancement of expenses, shall be a
defense to the Proceeding or create a presumption that the Indemnitee is not so entitled,

(e) Nonexclusivity of Rights. The right to indemnification and the payment
of expenses incurred in defending a Proceeding in advance of its final disposition granted in this
Article IV shall not be exclusive of any other right which any Indemnitee may have or hereafter
acquire under any statute, provision of this Article or the bylaws, agreement, vote of
shareholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise. The Company shall have the express right
to grant additional indemnity without seeking further approval or satisfaction by the
shareholders. All applicable indemnity provisions and any applicable law shall be interpreted
and applied so as to provide an Indemnitee with the broadest but nonduplicative indemnity to
which he or she is entitled.

4.14. Contribution. If the indemnification provided in Section 4.2 is not available to be paid
to Indemnitee for any reason other than those set forth in Sections 4.2(a), 4.2(b) or 4.2(c) (for
example, because indemnification is held to be against public policy even though otherwise
permitted under Section 4.2) then in respect of any Proceeding in which the Company is jointly
liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such Proceeding), the Company shall contribute
to the amount of loss paid or payable by Indemnitee in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect: the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Indemnitee on the
other hand from the transaction from which such Proceeding arose, and the relative fault of the
Company on the one hand and the Indemnitee on the other hand in connection with the events
which resulted in such loss, as well as any other relevant equitable consideration. The relative
benefits received by and fault of the Company on the one hand and the Indemnitee on the other
shall be determined by a court of appropriate jurisdiction (which may be the same court in which
the Proceeding took place) with reference to, among other things, the parties’ relative intent,
knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent the circumstances
resulting in such loss. The Company agrees that it would not be just and equitable if a

WEST\245950535.6 . 25

contribution pursuant to this Article was determined by pro rata allocation or any other method
of allocation which does not take account of the foregoing equitable considerations.

4.15. Exceptions. Any other provision herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company
shall not be obligated pursuant to the terms of the Articles to indemnify or advance expenses to
Indemnitee with respect to any Proceeding: (a) initiated voluntarily by Indemnitee and not by
way of defense, unless (x) approved or authorized in advance by the Board of Directors, (y)
brought to establish or enforce a right to indemnification under the Articles or any other statute
or law or (z) as otherwise required under the statute; (b) instituted by Indemnitee to enforce or
interpret this Article, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that each of the material
assertions made by Indemnitee in such Proceeding was not made in good faith or was frivolous;
(c) for which any of the expenses or liabilities for indemnification is being sought have been paid
directly to Indemnitee by an insurance carrier under a policy of officers’ and directors’ liability
insurance maintained by the Company; or (d) if the Company is prohibited by applicable law as
then in effect from paying such indemnification and/or advancement of expenses.

Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 2,3.4(d), and the
Conversion Price for the Series C Preferred Stock shall also be subject to adjustment as set forth
in Section 2.3.4(a)(3), as applicable.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion.

(1) Optional Conversions. Before any holder of Series Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender
the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed (or, if such holder alleges that such
certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit reasonably acceptable to
the Company), at the office of the Company or of any transfer agent for such Series Preferred
Stock, and shall give written notice to the Company at its principal corporate office, of the
election to convert the same and shalt state therein. the name or names in which the certificate or
certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued. The Company shall, as soon as
practicable thereafter, (i) issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Seriés Preferred Stock,
or to the nominee or nominees of such holder (subject to any applicable transfer restrictions), a
certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall
be entitled as aforesaid, (ii) pay in cash such amount as provided in Section 2.3.4(d)(7)(A) in lieu
of any fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion and (iii)
pay all declared but unpaid dividends on the shares of Series Preferred Stock being converted.
Such conversion shalt be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business
on the date of such surrender of the shares of Series Preferred Stock to be converted, the rights of
the holder of the shares of Series Preferred Stock converted as a holder of Series Preferred Stock
shall cease (except the right to receive the items provided for in the immediately preceding
sentence), and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable
upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such
shares of Common Stock as of such date. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if a
conversion of Series Preferred Stock js to be made in connection with a Liquidation Transaction,
an underwritten offering of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act or a share sale
transaction or another transaction affecting the Company or a holder of Series Preferred Stock,
the conversion of any shares of Series Preferred Stock may, at the election of the holders such
shares, be conditioned upon the consummation of such event or transaction, in which case such
conversion shall not be deemed to be effective until such event or transaction has been
consummated. Such converted Series Preferred Stock shall be retired and cancelled and may not
be reissued as shares of such series, and the Company may thereafter take such appropriate
action (without the need for shareholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized
number of shares of Series Preferred Stock accordingly.

(2) Mandatory Conversions. Al! holders of record of shares of Series
Preferred Stock shall be sent written notice of the Mandatory Conversion Time and the place

WESTW245950135.6 12

designated for mandatory conversion of ali such shares of Series Preferred Stock pursuant to
Section 2.3.4(a)(1). Such notice need not be sent in advance of the occurrence of the Mandatory
Conversion Time. Upon receipt of such notice, each holder of Series Preferred Stock shall
surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed (or, if such holder alleges that
such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit reasonably
acceptable to the Company), at the office of the Company or of any transfer agent for such Series
Preferred Stock. If so required by the Company, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be
endorsed or accompanied by written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to
the Company, duly executed by the registered holder or by his, her or its attorney duly authorized
in writing. The Company shall, as soon as practicable after the Mandatory Conversion Time and
the surtender of the certificate or certificates (or lost certificate affidavit) for Series Preferred
Stock, (i) issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Series Preferred Stock, or to the
nominee or nominees of such holder (subject to any applicable transfer restrictions), a certificate
or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled
as aforesaid, {ii) pay in cash such amount as provided in Section 2,3.4(d)(7){A) in lieu of any
fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion and (iii) pay all
declared but unpaid dividends on the shares of Series Preferred Stock being converted. Such
conversion shall be deemed to have been made at the Mandatory Conversion Time
(notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender the certificates at or
prior to such time), the rights of the holder of the shares of Series Preferred Stock converted as a
holder of Series Preferred Stock shall cease (except the right to receive the items provided for in
the immediately preceding sentence), and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record
holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock as of the Mandatory Conversion Time. Such
converted Series Preferred Stock shall be retired and cancelled and may not be reissued as shares
of such series, and the Company may thereafter take such appropriate action (without the need
for shaseholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Series
Preferred Stock accordingly.

(d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Series Preferred Stock for Certain
Dilutive Issuances, Splits and Combinations. The applicable Conversion Price of the Series
Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time after the date hereof, as follows:

(1) — Issuance of Additional Stock below Purchase Price,

(A) — Issuances of Additional Stock. If the Company shall issue,
any Additional Stock (as defined below) for consideration per share less than the Conversion
Price applicable to a series of Series Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to the issuance
of such Additional Stock, such Conversion Price shall automatically be adjusted as set forth in
this Section 2.3.4(d)(), unless otherwise provided in this Section 2.3.4(d){1),

(B) Adjustment Formula. Whenever the Conversion Price is
adjusted pursuant to Section 2.3.4(d)(1)(A), the new Conversion Price shall be determined by
multiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional
Stock by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Outstanding
Common Stock (as defined below) immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares
of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received by the Company for the total

WEST\245950135,6 13

number of shares of Additional Stock so issued would purchase at the Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such issuance and (ii) the denominator of which shal! be the number of
shares of Outstanding Common Stock immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of
shares of such Additional Stock so issued. For purposes of the foregoing calculation, the term
“Outstanding Common Stock” shall mean the number of shares of Common Stock actually
issued and outstanding at the time of determination plus the number of shares of Common Stock
deemed issued at such time pursuant to Section 2.3.4(d)(1)(F) below.

(C) Definition of “Additional Stock”. For purposes of this
Section 2.3.4(d)(1), “Additional Stock” shall mean any shares of Common Stock issued (or

deemed to have been issued pursuant to Section 2.3.4(d)(1)(F)) by the Company on or after the
date of these Amended Articles other than:

time by the Board of Directors;

Directors; and

Stock shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such options or rights were issued and for
a consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in
Section 2.3.4(d)(1)(E)), if any, received by the Company upon the issuance of such options or

such convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof shall

conversion or exchange of such securities.

(iv) Upon the expiration of any such options or rights,
the termination of any such rights to convert or exchange, or the expiration of any options or
rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Conversion Price of a series of

holders of such series of Series Preferred Stock after each such transaction to the end that the
provisions of this Section 2.3.4 (including adjustment of the Conversion Price then in effect and

determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. Whether or not fractional shares would be
issuable upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of
Series Preferred Stock the holder is at the time converting into Common Stock and the aggregate
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion,

the swom statement and the evidence constitute an “Indemnification Statement”). Submission of
an Indemnification Statement to the Board of Directors shall create a presumption that the
Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification hereunder, and the Company shall, within sixty (60)
calendar days thereafter, make the payments requested in the Indemnification Statement to or for
the benefit of the Indemnitee, unless, within such sixty (60) calendar day period the Company
shall notify the Indemnitee in writing that the Company has determined, based upon clear and
convincing evidence, that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under this Article.

payment of expenses in advance of a final disposition of the Proceeding must furnish to the
Company, as part of the Indemnification Statement: (a) a written affirmation of the Indemnitee’s
good faith belief that the Indemnitee has met the standard of conduct required to be eligible for
indemnification; and (b) a written undertaking, constituting an unlimited general obligation of
the Indemnitee, to repay the advance if it is ultimately determined that the Indemnitee did not

calendar days thereafter.

Indemnitee without Indemnitee’s written consent. Neither the Company nor Indemnitee may
unreasonably withhold its consent to a proposed settlement.

4.13. Contract and Related Rights.

(a) Contract Rights. The right of an Indemnitee to indemnification and
advancement of expenses is a contract right upon which the Indemnitee shall be presumed to
have relied in determining to serve or to continue to serve in his or her capacity with the
Company. Such right shall continue as long as the Indemnitee shall be subject to any possible
Proceeding, Any amendment to or repeal of this Article shall not adversely affect any right or
protection of an Indemnitee with respect to any acts or omissions of such Indemnitee occurring
prior to such amendment or repeal.

(b) Optional Insurance, Contracts, and Funding. The Company may purchase
and maintain insurance on behalf of an individual who is or was a director, officer, employee, or

Agent of the Company or, who, while a director, officer, employee, or Agent of the Company, is

Agent of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee
benefit plan, or other enterprise against Liability asserted against or incurred by the individual in

WES1\245950135.6 : 24

whether or not the Company would have power to indemnify the individual against such
Liability under RCW 23B.08.510 or 23B.08.520.

(c) Severability. If any provision or application of this Article shall be invalid
or unenforceable, the remainder of this Article and its remaining applications shall not be
affected thereby, and shall continue in full force and effect.

{d) Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit. If either (1) a claim under this Article
IV for indemnification is not paid in full by the Company within sixty (60) days after a written
claim has been received by the Company or (2) a claim under this Article IV for advancement of
expenses is not paid in full by the Company within twenty (20) days after a written claim has
been received by the Company, then the Indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against
the Company to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. To the extent successful in whole or in
part, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to also be paid the expense (to be proportionately prorated
if the Indemnitee is only partially successful) of prosecuting such claim. Neither (1) the failure
of the Company to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such Proceeding
that indemnification or reimbursement or advancement of expenses to the Indemnitee is proper
in the circumstances, nor (2) an actual determination by the Company that the Indemuaitee is not
entitled to indemnification or to the reimbursement or advancement of expenses, shall be a
defense to the Proceeding or create a presumption that the Indemnitee is not so entitled.

(ec) Nonexclusivity of Rights. The right to indemnification and the payment
of expenses incurred in defending a Proceeding in advance of its final disposition granted in this
Article ['V shall not be exclusive of any other right which any Indemnitee may have or hereafter
acquire under any statute, provision of this Article or the bylaws, agreement, vote of
shareholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise. The Company shali have the express right
to grant additional indemnity without seeking further approval or satisfaction by the
shareholders. All applicable indemnity provisions and any applicable law shall be interpreted
and applied so as to provide an Indemnitee with the broadest but nonduplicative indemnity to
which he or she is entitled,

4.14. Contribution. If the indemnification provided in Section 4.2 is not available to be paid
to Indemnitee for any reason other than those set forth in Sections 4.2(a), 4.2(b) or 4.2(c) (for
example, because indemnification is held to be against public policy even though otherwise
permitted under Section 4.2) then in respect of any Proceeding in which the Company is jointly
liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such Proceeding), the Company shall contribute
to the amount of loss paid or payable by Indemnitee in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect: the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Indemnitee on the
other hand from the transaction from which such Proceeding arose, and the relative fault of the
Company on the one hand and the Indemnitee on the other hand in connection with the events
which resulted in such loss, as well as any other relevant equitable consideration. The relative
benefits received by and fault of the Company on the one hand and the Indemnitee on the other
shall be determined by a court of appropriate jurisdiction (which may be the same court in which
the Proceeding took place) with reference to, among other things, the parties’ relative intent,
knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent the circumstances
resulting in such loss. The Company agrees that it would not be just and equitable if a

WEST245950135.6 , 25

contribution pursuant to this Article was determined by pro rata allocation or any other method
of allocation which does not take account of the foregoing equitable considerations,

4.15. Exceptions. Any other provision herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company
shall not be obligated pursuant to the terms of the Articles to indemnify or advance expenses to
Indemnitee with respect to any Proceeding: (a) initiated voluntarily by Indemnitee and not by
way of defense, unless (x) approved or authorized in advance by the Board of Directors, (y)
brought to establish or enforce a right to indemnification under the Articles or any other statute
or law or (z) as otherwise required under the statute; (b) instituted by Indemnitee to enforce or
interpret this Article, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that each of the material
assertions made by Indemnitee in such Proceeding was not made in good faith or was frivolous;
(c) for which any of the expenses or liabilities for indemnification is being sought have been paid
directly to Indemnitee by an insurance carrier under a policy of officers’ and directors’ liability
insurance maintained by the Company; or (d) if the Company is prohibited by applicable law as
then in effect from paying such indemnification and/or advancement of expenses.
