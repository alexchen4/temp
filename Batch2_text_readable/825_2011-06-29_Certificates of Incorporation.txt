2.3.3 Liquidation Preference.

(a) Preferential Amounts. In the event of any voluntary or involuntary
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company (each, a “Liquidation Transaction”), the
holders of shares of Series Preferred Stock then outstanding shall be entitled to receive, by
reason of their ownership thereof, prior and in preference to any distribution of the assets of the
Company to the holders of the Common Stock or any other series of Preferred Stock that ranks
junior in liquidation to the Series Preferred Stock, on a pari passu basis, as applicable:

{1) an amount per share of Series A Preferred Stock equal to (A) the
Series A Liquidation Value plus (B) all declared and unpaid dividends on such share of Series A
Preferred Stock, if any;

(2) an amount per share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock equal to (A) the
Series A-] Liquidation Value plus (B) all declared and unpaid dividends on such share of Series
A-1 Preferred Stock, if any;

(3) | an amount per share of Series A-2 Preferred Stock equal to (A) the
Series A-2 Liquidation Value plus (B) all declared.and unpaid dividends on such share of Series
A-2 Preferred Stock, if any;

(4) an amount per share of Series B Preferred Stock equal! to (A) the
Series B Liquidation Value plus (B) all declared and unpaid dividends on such share of Series B
Preferred Stock, if any; and

(5S) an amount per share of Series B-] Preferred Stock equal to (A) the
Series B-] Liquidation Value plus (B) all declared and unpaid dividends on such share of Series
B-1 Preferred Stock, if any.

If the amount of cash, securities or other property which a holder of any shares of Series
Preferred Stock would have been entitled to receive with respect to such shares if they had been
converted to Common Stock immediately prior to such Liquidation Transaction of the Company,
and had therefore become entitled to participate as shares of Common Stock in distributions
pursuant to Section 2.3.3(b) below, would be greater than the applicable preferential amount for
such shares as set forth in Sections 2.3.3(a)(1), 2.3,3(a)(2), 2.3.3(a)(3), 2.3.3(a)(4) or 2.3.3(a)(5)
above, as applicable, then such shares will automatically be entitled to such greater amount of
preferential distributions that would have been payable upon conversion under this Section
2,3.3(a}. If, upon any such Liquidation Transaction of the Company, the assets and funds
available for distribution to the holders of Series Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit

WEST\223481551.3 . 5
payment to the holders of Series Preferred Stock of the full preferential amounts described in this
Section 2,3.3(a), then the entire amount of assets and funds available for distribution shall be
distributed ratably among the holders of Series Preferred Stock in proportion to the preferential
amount each such holder is otherwise entitled to receive under this Section 2.3.3.

(b) Remaining Assets. After the payment of the full liquidation preference of
the Series Preferred Stock as set forth in Section 2.3.3(a) above, any remaining assets and funds
of the Company available for distribution shall be distributed ratably among the holders of
Common Stock.

(c) Certain Acquisitions.

(1) Deemed Liquidations. For purposes of this Section 2.3.3, a
Liquidation Transaction of the Company (unless otherwise determined by the holders of a
majority of the outstanding Series Preferred Stock) shall be deemed to include (and each holder

Company (or the successor or purchasing entity) in the aggregate amount specified herein that
such holder would have received upon a Liquidation Transaction in accordance with Sections
2.3,3(a} and 2.3.3(b) above): (A) the acquisition of shares of capital stock of the Company
representing a majority of the Company’s combined ordinary voting power by any Person, or
any “group” as defined in Regulation 13D under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, by means of any transaction or series of related transactions, including, without
limitation, any reorganization, merger or consolidation, but excluding (i) any bona fide financing
transaction (provided the proceeds of such financing are not intended to be used, in whole or in
part, by the Company to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire for value any of the capital stock
or other equity securities of the Company) or (ii) any such reorganization, merger or
consolidation involving the Company or a Subsidiary in which the shares of capital stock of the
Company outstanding immediately prior to such reorganization, merger or consolidation
comtinue to represent, or are converted into or exchanged for, shares of capital stock which
continue to represent, immediately following such reorganization, merger or consolidation, a
majority of the combined ordinary voting power of the outstanding capital stock of (x) the
surviving or resulting corporation, or, (y) if the surviving or resulting corporation is a wholly-
owned subsidiary of another corporation immediately following such reorganization, merger or
consolidation, of the parent corporation of such surviving or resulting corporation; and (B) a sale,
lease, transfer or other disposition, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, by the
Company or any Subsidiary of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, except where such sale, lease, transfer or other disposition is to a
wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company (each of (A) and (B) of this Subsection, a “Deemed
Liquidation”),

(2) . Valuation of Consideration. In the event of a Liquidation
Transaction as described in Section 2.3.3(a) or Section 2.3.3(c) above, if the consideration
received by the Company is in whole or in part other than cash, then the amounts payable to all
holders of shares of Series Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 2.3.3 shall be paid in the
same form of consideration that is paid to the other shareholders of the Company, with the value
of any such non-cash consideration (other than securities) determined as provided in the
definitive agreement(s) entered into in connection with any such Liguidation Transaction, or, if

WEST\223481551.3 6

the non-cash consideration consists of securities for which no value is established in such
definitive agreement(s), as follows:

(A) Freely Tradable Securities. The method of valuation of
securities not subject to investment letter or other similar restrictions on free marketability shall
be as follows:

National Market, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the
securities on such exchange over the thirty-day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing;

(ii) if actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall
be deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the
thirty-day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing; and

(iii) if there is no active public market, the value shall be
the fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(B) Restricted Securities. The method of valuation of securities
subject to investment letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions
arising solely by virtue of a shareholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to

market value thereof, as determined by the Board of Directors.

Section 2.3.4, any shares of Series Preferred Stock may, at the option of the holder, be converted

sale of Common Stock to the public that results in aggregate cash proceeds to the Company of
not less than $20,000,000 (net of underwriting discounts and commissions) or (B) the date
specified by written consent or agreement of the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding
shares of Series Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class (the time of such closing or the
date and time specified or the time of the event specified in such vote or written consent is
referred to herein as the “Mandatory Conversion Time”); provided, that automatic conversion of
the Series B Preferred Stock and the Series B-1 Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section
2.3.4(a)(1)(B) shalj require the written consent or agreement of the holders of a majority of the
then-outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock and Series B-1 Preferred Stock, voting
together as a single class, which majority shall include the approval of Sageview for so long as
Sageview continues to hold at least 9,090,909 shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock.

(2) The number of shares of Common Stock to which a holder of
Series Preferred Stock shal! be entitled upon conversion under this Section 2.3.4(a) shall be the

WEST\22348 1551.3 7

product obtained by multiplying the Applicable Conversion Rate (determined as provided in
Section 2.3.4(b) below) by the number of shares of Series Preferred Stock to be converted,

(b) Applicable Conversion Rate. The conversion rate in effect at any time
(the “Applicable Conversion Rate”) for each share of a particular series of Series Preferred Stock
shall be the quotient obtained by dividing the applicable original purchase price (the “Original
Purchase Price”) for that series of Series Preferred Stock, as set forth below, by the Conversion
Price applicable to such series, determined as hereinafter provided, in effect on the date the
certificate is surrendered for conversion, The Original Purchase Price for the Series A Preferred
Stock and the Series A-2 Preferred Stock is $0.888 per share; the Original Purchase Price for the
Series A-] Preferred Stock is $0.444 per share; the Original Purchase Price for the Series B
Preferred Stock is $0.94 per share; and the Original Purchase Price for the Series B-1] Preferred
Stock is $1.10 per share. As of the date of filing of these Amended Articles, the initial
Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series A-2 Preferred Stock is $0.888
per share; the initial Conversion Price for the Series A-! Preferred Stock is $0.444 per share: the
initial Conversion Price for the Series B Preferred Stock is $0.94 per share; and the initial
Conversion Price for the Series B-1 Preferred Stock is $1.10 per share, Each such initial
Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 2.3.4(d).

(c) Mechanics of Conversion.

(1) Optional Conversions. Before any holder of Series Preferred Stock
shail be entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock, such holder shal! surrender
the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed (or, if such holder alleges that such
certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit reasonably acceptable to
the Company), at the office of the Company or of any transfer agent for such Series Preferred
Stock, and shall give written notice to the Company at its principal corporate office, of the
election to convert the same and shall state therein the name or names in which the certificate or
certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued. The Company shall, as soon as
practicable thereafter, (i) issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Series Preferred Stock,
or to the nominee or nominees of such holder (subject to any applicable transfer restrictions), a
certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall
be entitled as aforesaid, (ii) pay in cash such amount as provided in Section 2.3.4(d)(7)(A) in lieu
of any fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion and (iii)
pay all declared but unpaid dividends on the shares of Series Preferred Stock being converted.
Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business
on the date of such surrender of the shares of Series Preferred Stock to be converted, the rights of
the holder of the shares of Series Preferred Stock converted as a holder of Series Preferred Stock
shall cease (except the right to receive the items provided for in the immediately preceding
sentence), and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable
upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such
shares of Common Stock as of such date. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if a
conversion of Series Preferred Stock is to be made in connection with a Liquidation Transaction,
an underwritten offering of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act or a share sale
transaction or another transaction affecting the Company or a holder of Series Preferred Stock,
the conversion of any shares of Series Preferred Stock may, at the election of the holders such
shares, be conditioned upon the consummation of such event or transaction, in which case such

WEST\223481551.3 : 8

conversion shall not be deemed to be effective until such event or transaction has been
consummated, Such converted Series Preferred Stock shall be retired and cancelled and may not
be reissued as shares of such series, and the Company may thereafter take such appropriate
action (without the need for stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized
number of shares of Series Preferred Stock accordingly.

(2) | Mandatory Conversions. All holders of record of shares of Series
Preferred Stock shall be sent written notice of the Mandatory Conversion Time and the place
designated for mandatory conversion of all such shares of Series Preferred Stock pursuant to
Section 2.3.4{a)(1). Such notice need not be sent in advance of the occurrence of the Mandatory
Conversion Time. Upon receipt of such notice, each holder of Series Preferred Stock shall
surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed (or, if such holder alleges that
such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit reasonably
acceptable to the Company), at the office of the Company or of any transfer agent for such Series
Preferred Stock. If so required by the Company, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be
endorsed or accompanied by written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to
the Company, duly executed by the registered holder or by his, her or its attorney duly authorized
in writing. The Company shall, as soon as practicable after the Mandatory Conversion Time and
the surrender of the certificate or certificates (or lost certificate affidavit) for Series Preferred
Stock, (i) issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Series Preferred Stock, or to the
nominee or nominees of such holder (subject to any applicable transfer restrictions), a certificate
or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled
as aforesaid, (ii) pay in cash such amount as provided in Section 2.3.4(d)(7)(A) in lieu of any
fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion and (iii) pay all
declared but unpaid dividends on the shares of Series Preferred Stock being converted. Such
conversion shall be deemed to have been made at the Mandatory Conversion Time
(notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender the certificates at or
prior to such time), the rights of the holder of the shares of Series Preferred Stock converted as a
holder of Series Preferred Stock shall cease (except the right to receive the items provided for in
the immediately preceding sentence), and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record
holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock as of the Mandatory Conversion Time. Such
converted Series Preferred Stock shall be retired and cancelled and may not be reissued as shares
of such series, and the Company may thereafter take such appropriate action (without the need
for stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Series
Preferred Stock accordingly.

(d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Series Preferred Stock for Certain
Dilutive Issuances, Splits and Combinations, The applicable Conversion Price of the Series
Preferred Stock shail be subject to adjustment from time to time after the date hereof, as follows:

(1) — Issuance of Additional Stock below Purchase Price.
(A) — Issuances of Additional Stock. If the Company shall issue,

any Additional Stock (as defined below) for consideration per share less than the Conversion
Price applicable to a series of Series Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to the issuance

WEST\223481551.3 9

of such Additional Stock, such Conversion Price shall automatically be adjusted as set forth in
this Section 2.3.4(d)(1), unless otherwise provided in this Section 2.3.4(d)(1).

(B) Adjustment Formula, Whenever the Conversion Price is
adjusted pursuant to Section 2.3.4(d)(1)(A), the new Conversion Price shall be determined by
multiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional
Stock by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Outstanding
Common Stock (as defined below) immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares
of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received by the Company for the total
number of shares of Additional Stock so issued would purchase at the Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such issuance and (ii) the denominator of which shal] be the number of
shares of Outstanding Common Stock immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of
shares of such Additional Stock so issued. For purposes of the foregoing calculation, the term
“Outstanding Common Stock” shall mean the number of shares of Common Stock actually
issued and outstanding at the time of determination plus the number of shares of Common Stock
deemed issued at such time pursuant to Section 2.3.4(d)(1)(F) below.

(C) Definition of “Additional Stock”. For purposes of this
Section 2.3.4(d)(1), “Additional Stock” shall mean any. shares of Common Stock issued (or
deemed to have been issued pursuant to Section 2,3.4(d)(1)(F)) by the Company on or after the
date of these Amended Articles other than:

(i) Shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible

(5) below;

(ii} Shares of Common Stock and/or options, warrants
or other Common Stock purchase rights, and the Common Stock issued pursuant to such options,
warrants or other rights (in each case as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits,
recapitalizations and the like) issued or issuable to employees, officers, advisors, consultants,
directors or service providers of the Company and/or any Subsidiary, as approved from time to
time’by the Board of Directors;

(iii) Shares of Common Stock or convertible securities
issued or issuable upon exercise of or conversion of any warrants, options, or other convertible
securities, in each case that are outstanding as of the date of these Amended Articles (provided
that each such issuance is pursuant to the terms of such securities);

(iv) Shares of Common Stock issued or issuable upon
the conversion of shares of Series Preferred Stock;

(v) Shares of Common Stock issued or issuable in a

public offering prior to or in connection with which all outstanding shares of Series Preferred

series the number of shares of stock or other securities, cash or property, to which a holder of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such series immediately prior to such
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, merger or consolidation would have been
entitled to receive pursuant to such transaction. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall
be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 2.3.4 with respect to the rights of the
holders of such series of Series Preferred Stock after each such transaction to the end that the
provisions of this Section 2.3.4 (including adjustment of the Conversion Price then in effect and

in the circumstances, nor (2) an actual determination by the Company that the Indemnitee is not
entitled to indemnification or to the reimbursement or advancement of expenses, shall be a
defense to the Proceeding or create a presumption that the Indemnitee is not so entitled.

{e)  Nonexclusivity of Rights. The right to indemnification and the payment
of expenses incurted in defending a Proceeding in advance of its final disposition granted in this
Article IV shall not be exclusive of any other right which any Indemnitee may have or hereafier
acquire under any statute, provision of this Article or the bylaws, agreement, vote of
sharcholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise. The Company shall have the express right
to grant additional indemnity without seeking further approval or satisfaction by the
shareholders. All applicable indemnity provisions and any applicable law shall be interpreted
and applied so as to provide an Indemnitee with the broadest but nonduplicative indemnity to
which he or she is entitled.

4.14. Contribution. If the indemnification provided in Section 4.2 is not available to be paid
to Indemnitee for any reason other than those set forth in Sections 4.2(a), 4.2(b) or 4.2(c) (for
example, because indemnification is held to be against public policy even though otherwise
permitted under Section 4.2) then in respect of any Proceeding in which the Company is jointly
liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such Proceeding), the Company shall! contribute
to the amount of loss paid or payable by Indemnitee in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect: the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Indemnitee on the
other hand from the transaction from ‘which such Proceeding arose, and the relative fault of the
Company on the one hand and the Indemnitee on the other hand in connection with the events
which resulted in such loss, as well as any other relevant equitable consideration. The relative
benefits received by and fault of the Company on the one hand and the Indemnitee on the other
shall be determined by a court of appropriate jurisdiction (which may be the same court in which
the Proceeding took place) with reference to, among other things, the parties’ relative intent,
knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent the circumstances
resulting in such loss. The Company agrees that it would not be just and equitable if a
contribution pursuant to this Article was determined by pro rata allocation or any other method
of allocation which does not take account of the foregoing equitable considerations.

4,15, Exceptions. Any other provision herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company
shal] not be obligated pursuant to the terms of the Articles to indemnify or advance expenses to
Indemnitee with respect to any Proceeding: {a) initiated voluntarily by Indemnitee and not by
way of defense, unless (x) approved or authorized in advance by the Board of Directors, (y)
brought to establish or enforce a right to indemnification under the Articles or any other statute

WEST\W223481551,3 21

or law or (z) as otherwise required under the statute; (b) instituted by Indemnitee to enforce or
interpret this Article, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that each of the material
assertions made by Indemnitee in such Proceeding was not made in good faith or was frivolous;
(c) for which any of the expenses or liabilities for indemnification is being sought have been paid
directly to Indemnitee by an insurance carrier under a policy of officers’ and directors’ liability
insurance maintained by the Company; or (d) if the Company is prohibited by applicable law as
then in effect from paying such indemnification and/or advancement of expenses.

holders of shares of Series Preferred Stock then outstanding shall be entitled to receive, by
reason of their ownership thereof, prior and in preference to any distribution of the assets of the
Company to the holders of the Common Stock or any other series of Preferred Stock that ranks

Series A Liquidation Value plus (B) all declared and unpaid dividends on such share of Series A
Preferred Stock, if any;

(2) an amount per share of Series A-] Preferred Stock equal to (A) the
Series A-] Liquidation Value plus (B) all dectared and unpaid dividends on such share of Series

If the amount of cash, securities or other property which a holder of any shares of Series
Preferred Stock would have been entitled to receive with respect to such shares if they had been
converted to Common Stock immediately prior to such Liquidation Transaction of the Company,
and had therefore become entitled to participate as shares of Common Stock in distributions
pursuant to Section 2.3.3(b} below, would be greater than the applicable preferential amount for
such shares as set forth in Sections 2.3,3(a)(1), 2.3.3(a)(2), 2.3.3(a)(3), 2.3.3(a)(4) or 2.3.3(a)(5)
above, as applicable, then such shares will automatically be entitled to such greater amount of
preferential distributions that would have been payable upon conversion under this Section
2.3.3(a). If, upon any such Liquidation Transaction of the Company, the assets and funds
available for distribution to the holders of Series Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit

WEST\223481551.3 5

payment to the holders of Series Preferred Stock of the full preferential amounts described in this
Section 2.3.3(a), then the entire amount of assets and funds available for distribution shall be
distributed ratably among the holders of Series Preferred Stock in proportion to the preferential
amount each such holder is otherwise entitled to receive under this Section 2.3.3.

(b) Remaining Assets. After the payment of the full liquidation preference of
the Series Preferred Stock as set forth in Section 2.3,3(a) above, any remaining assets and funds
of the Company available for distribution shall be distributed ratably among the holders of
Common Stock,

Company (or the successor or purchasing entity) in the aggregate amount specified herein that
such holder would have received upon a Liquidation Transaction in accordance with Sections
2.3.3(a) and 2.3.3(b) above); (A) the acquisition of shares of capital stock of the Company
representing a majority of the Company’s combined ordinary voting power by any Person, or
any “group” as defined in Regulation 13D under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, by means of any transaction or series of related transactions, including, without
limitation, any reorganization, merger or consolidation, but excluding (i) any bona _ fide financing
transaction (provided the proceeds of such financing are not intended to be used, in whole or in
part, by the Company to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire for value any of the capital stock
or other equity securities of the Company) or (ii) any such reorganization, merger or
consolidation involving the Company or a Subsidiary in which the shares of capital stock of the
Company outstanding immediately prior to such reorganization, merger or consolidation
continue to represent, or are converted into or exchanged for, shares of capital stock which
continue to represent, immediately following such reorganization, merger or consolidation, a
majority of the combined ordinary voting power of the outstanding capital stock of (x) the
surviving or resulting corporation, or, (y) if the surviving or resulting corporation is a wholly-
owned subsidiary of another corporation immediately following such reorganization, merger or
consolidation, of the parent corporation of such surviving or resulting corporation; and (B) a sale,
lease, transfer or other disposition, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, by the
Company or any Subsidiary of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, except where such sale, lease, transfer or other disposition is to a
wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company (each of (A) and (B) of this Subsection, a “Deemed
Liquidation”).

(2) Valuation of Consideration. In the event of a Liquidation
Transaction as described in Section 2.3.3(a) or Section 2.3.3(c) above, if the consideration
received by the Company is in whole or in part other than cash, then the amounts payable to all
holders of shares of Series Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 2.3.3 shall be paid in the
same form of consideration that is paid to the other shareholders of the Company, with the value
of any such non-cash consideration (other than securities) determined as provided in the
definitive agreement(s) entered into in connection with any such Liquidation Transaction, or, if

WEST\223481551.3 : 6

the non-cash consideration consists of securities for which no value is established in such
definitive agreement(s), as follows:

securities not subject to investment letter or other similar restrictions on free marketability shall

specified by written consent or agreement of the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding
shares of Series Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class (the time of such closing or the
date and time specified or the time of the event specified in such vote or written consent is
referred to herein as the “Mandatory Conversion Time”); provided, that automatic conversion of
the Series B Preferred Stock and the Series B-] Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section
2,3,4(a)(1)(B) shail require the written consent or agreement of the holders of a majority of the

WEST\223481551.3 7

product obtained by multiplying the Applicable Conversion Rate (determined as provided in
Section 2,3.4(b) below) by the number of shares of Series Preferred Stock to be converted.

(b) Applicable Conversion Rate. The conversion rate in effect at any time
(the “Applicable Conversion Rate”) for each share of a particular series of Series Preferred Stock
shall be the quotient obtained by dividing the applicable original purchase price (the “Original
Purchase Price”) for that series of Series Preferred Stock, as set forth below, by the Conversion
Price applicable to such series, determined as hereinafter provided, in effect on the date the
certificate is surrendered for conversion, The Original Purchase Price for the Series A Preferred

(c) Mechanics of Conversion.

(1)  Qptional Conversions. Before any holder of Series Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender
the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed (or, if such holder alleges that such
certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit reasonably acceptable to
the Company), at the office of the Company or of any transfer agent for such Series Preferred
Stock, and shall give written notice to the Company at its principal corporate office, of the
election to convert the same and shall state therein the name or names in which the certificate or
certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued. The Company shall, as soon as
practicable thereaftei, (i) issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Series Preferred Stock,
or to the nominee or nominees of such holder (subject to any applicable transfer restrictions), a
certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall
be entitled as aforesaid, (ii) pay in cash such amount as provided in Section 2.3.4(d)(7)(A) in lieu
of any fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion and (iii)
pay all declared but unpaid dividends on the shares of Series Preferred Stock being converted.
Such conversion shal] be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business
on the date of such surrender of the shares of Series Preferred Stock to be converted, the rights of
the holder of the shares of Series Preferred Stock converted as a holder of Series Preferred Stock
shall cease (except the right to receive the items provided for in the immediately preceding
sentence), and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable
upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such
shares of Common Stock as of such date. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if a
conversion of Series Preferred Stock is to be made in connection with a Liquidation Transaction,
an underwritten offering of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act or a share sale
transaction or another transaction affecting the Company or a holder of Series Preferred Stock,
the conversion of any shares of Series Preferred Stock may, at the election of the holders such
shares, be conditioned upon the consummation of such event or transaction, in which case such

WEST\223481551.3 8

conversion shall not be deemed to be effective until such event or transaction has been
consummated. Such converted Series Preferred Stock shall be retired and cancelled and may not
be reissued as shares of such series, and the Company may thereafter take such appropriate
action (without the need for stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized
number of shares of Series Preferred Stock accordingly.

(2) Mandatory Conversions. . All holders of record of shares of Series
Preferred Stock shall be sent written notice of the Mandatory Conversion Time and the place
designated for mandatory conversion of all such shares of Series Preferred: Stock pursuant to
Section 2,3,4(a)(1), Such notice need not be sent in advance of the occurrence of the Mandatory
Conversion Time. Upon receipt of such notice, each holder of Series Preferred Stock shall
surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed (or, if such holder alleges that
such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit reasonably
acceptable to the Company), at the office of the Company or of any transfer agent for such Series
Preferred Stock. If so required by the Company, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be
endorsed or accompanied by written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to
the Company, duly executed by the registered holder or by his, her or its attorney duly authorized
in writing. The Company shall, as soon as practicable after the Mandatory Conversion Time and
the surrender of the certificate or certificates (or lost certificate affidavit) for Series Preferred
Stock, (i) issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Series Preferred Stock, or to the
nominee or nominees of such holder (subject to any applicable transfer restrictions), a certificate
or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled
as aforesaid, (ii) pay in cash such amount as provided in Section 2.3.4(d)(7)(A) in lieu of any
fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion and (iii) pay all
declared but unpaid dividends on the shares of Series Preferred Stock being converted. Such
conversion shall be deemed to have been made at the Mandatory Conversion Time
(notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender the certificates at or
prior to such time), the rights of the holder of the shares of Series Preferred Stock converted as a
holder of Series Preferred Stock shall cease (except the right to receive the items provided for in
the immediately preceding sentence), and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record
holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock as of the Mandatory Conversion Time. Such
converted Series Preferred Stock shall be retired and cancelled and may not be reissued as shares
of such series, and the Company may thereafter take such appropriate action (without the need
for stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Series
Preferred Stock accordingly.

(d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Series Preferred Stock for Certain
Dilutive Issuances, Splits and Combinations. The applicable Conversion Price of the Series

Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time after the date hereof, as follows:

(1) Issuance of Additional Stock below Purchase Price.

(A) — Issuances of Additional Stock. If the Company shall issue,
any Additional Stock (as defined below) for consideration per share less than the Conversion
Price applicable to a series of Series Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to the issuance

WES1\223481551,3 9

of such Additional Stock, such Conversion Price shall automatically be adjusted as set forth in
this Section 2.3.4(d)(1), unless otherwise provided in this Section 2.3.4(d)(1).

(B) Adjustment Formula. Whenever the Conversion Price is
adjusted pursuant to Section 2.3,4(d)(1)(A), the new Conversion Price shall be determined by
multiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional
Stock by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Outstanding
Common Stock (as defined below) immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares
of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received by the Company for the total
number of shares of Additional Stock so issued would purchase at the Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such issuance and (ii) the denominator of which shall be the number of
shares of Outstanding Common Stock immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of
shares of such Additional Stock so issued. For purposes of the foregoing calculation, the term
“Outstanding Common Stock” shall mean the number of shares of Common Stock actually
issued and outstanding at the time of determination plus the number of shares of Common Stock
deemed issued at such time pursuant to Section 2.3.4(d)(1)(F) below,

{C) Definition of “Additional Stock”. For purposes of this
Section 2,3.4(d)(1), “Additional Stock” shall mean any shares of Common Stock issued (or
deemed to have been issued pursuant to Section 2.3.4(d)(1)(F)) by the Company on or after the
date of these Amended Articles other than:

directors or service providers of the Company and/or any Subsidiary, as approved from time to
time by the Board of Directors;

(iii) Shares of Common Stock or convertible securities

(x) | Shares of Common Stock or convertible securities
issued or issuable to any other persons or entities in connection with the acquisition by the

Directors; and

(xi) Shares of Common Stock or convertible securities
excluded from the definition of Additional Stock by thé affirmative vote or written consent of:

1) — a majority of those holders of Series Preferred
Stock that otherwise would be entitled to an antidilution adjustment as a result of the issuance of
such Common Stock (including shares deemed to have been issued pursuant to
Section 2.3.4¢d)(1)(F));

2) if the holders of SeriesB Preferred Stock

together as a single class.

Conversion Price for the Series Preferred Stock shall be made in an amount less than $0.001 per

WEST\223481551.3 1)

share, and any adjustments of less than one cent shall be carried forward and aggregated with
any future adjustments until such aggregate adjustments are equal to at least one cent.

{E) Determination of Consideration. In the case of the issuance
of Common Stock for cash, the consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid
therefor before deducting any reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed,
paid or incurred by the Company for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the
issuance and sale thereof, In the case of the issuance of the Common Stock for consideration in
whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be deemed to be the fair
value thereof as determined by the Board of Directors irrespective of any accounting treatment.

(F) Deemed Issuances of Common Stock. In the case of the
issuance (whether before, on or after the date hereof) of options to purchase or rights to subscribe
for Common Stock, securities by their terms convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for

such convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof shall
be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or such options or rights
were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration, if any, received by the Company
for any such securities and related options or rights, plus the minimum additional consideration,
if any, to be received by the Company (without taking into account potential antidilution
adjustments) upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or the exercise of any related
options or rights (the consideration in each case to be determined in the manner provided in
Section 2.3.4(d)(1)(E)).

(iii) In the event of any change in the number of shares
of Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to the Company upon exercise of
such options or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such convertible or exchangeable
securities, including, but not limited to, a change resulting from the antidilution provisions
thereof, the Conversion Price of a series of Series Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way

WEST\223481551,3 12

affected by or computed using such options, rights or securities, shall be recomputed to reflect
such change, but no further adjustment shall be made for the actual issuance of Common Stock
or any payment of such consideration upon the exercise of any such options or rights or the
conversion or exchange of such securities.

(iv) Upon the expiration of any such options or rights,
the termination of any such rights to convert or exchange, or the expiration of any options or
rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Conversion Price of a series of
Series Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such options,

shareholders to consider the action be given to nonvoting shareholders, to all nonvoting
shareholders}, in writing, describing with reasonable clarity the general nature of the action, and

shareholders of the Company for which the Act requires (unless the Articles provide otherwise,
in which case the Articles shall control) the approval of two-thirds of the votes of each voting
group entitled to be cast thereon, the approval of a majority, rather than two-thirds, of the votes
of each voting group entitled to be cast on such matter shall be sufficient for such matter to be

to the extent not inconsistent with the Act, amendments to the Articles, mergers and share

WEST\223481551.3 . 17

exchanges, sales of assets other than in the ordinary course of business, and dissolution. The
provisions of this Section 3.5 are specifically intended to reduce the voting requirements
otherwise prescribed under RCW 23B.10.030, 23B.11.030, 23B.12.020 and 23B.14.020, in
accordance with RCW 23B.07.270, ,

4.6. Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the Company, The Company may, by
action of its Board of Directors from time to time, provide indemnification and pay expenses in
advance of the final disposition of a Proceeding to Employees and Agents of the Company who
are not also Directors, in each case to the same extent as to a Director with respect to the
indemnification and advancement of expenses pursuant to rights granted under, or provided by,
the Act or otherwise.

4.7. Partial Indemnification. If an Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification by the
Company for some or a portion of expenses, liabilities, or losses actually and reasonably incurred
by Indemnitee in an investigation, defense, appeal or settlement but not, however, for the total
amount thereof, the Company shail nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee for the portion of such
expenses, liabilities or losses to which Indemnitee is entitled.

4.8. Procedure for Seeking Indemnification and/or Advancement of Expenses. The
following procedures shall apply in the absence of (or at the option of the Indemnitee, in addition
thereto) specific procedures otherwise applicable to an Indemnitee pursuant to a contract, trust
agreement, or general or specific action of the Board of Directors:

4.9. Notification and Defense of Claim. Indemnitee shal] promptly notify the Company in
writing of any Proceeding for which indemnification could be sought under this Article. In
addition, Indemnitee shall. give the Company such information and cooperation as it may
reasonably require and as shall be within Indemnitee’s power. With respect to any such
Proceeding as to which Indemnitee has notified the Company: (a) the Company will be entitled
to participate therein at its own expense; and (b) except as otherwise provided below, to the
extent that it may wish, the Company, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly
notified, will be entitled to assume‘the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to Indemnitee.
Indemnitee’s consent to such counsel may not be unreasonably withheld. After notice from the
Company to Indemnitee of its election to assume the defense, the Company will not be liable to
Indemnitee under this Article for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by
Indemnitee in connection with such defense, However, Indemnitee shall continue to have the
right to employ its counsel in such Proceeding, at Indemnitee’s expense; and if (i) the
employment of counsel by Indemnitee has been authorized by the Company, (ii) Indemnitee
shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest between the Company
and Indemnitee in the conduct of such defense, or (iii) the Company shall not in fact have
employed counsel to assume the defense of such Proceeding, then the fees and expenses of
Indemnitee’s counsel shall be at the expense of the Company. The Company shall not be
entitled to assume the defense of any Proceeding brought by or on behalf of the Company or as
to which Indemnitee shall reasonably have made the conclusion that a conflict of interest may
exist between the Company and the Indemnitee in the conduct of the defense.

4.10, Information to be Submitted and Method of Determination and Authorization of
Indemnification. For the purpose of pursuing rights to indemnification under this Article, the
Indemnitee shall submit to the Board of Directors a sworn statement requesting indemnification
and reasonable evidence of all amounts for which such indemnification is requested (together,
the sworn statement and the evidence constitute an “Indemnification Statement”). Submission of
an Indemnification Statement to the Board of Directors shall create a presumption that the
Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification hereunder, and the Company shall, within sixty (60)

WEST\223481551.3 19

calendar days thereafter, make the payments requested in the Indemnification Statement to or for
the benefit of the Indemnitee, unless, within such sixty (60) calendar day period the Company
shall notify the Indemnitee in writing that the Company has determined, based upon clear and
convincing evidence, that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under this Article.
Any determination that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification, and any failure to make
the payments requested in the Indemnification Statement, shall be subject to judicial review by
any court of competent jurisdiction.

4.11, Special Procedure Regarding Advances for Expenses. An Indemnitee seeking
payment of expenses in advance of a final disposition of the Proceeding must furnish to the
Company, as part of the Indemnification Statement: (a) a written affirmation of the Indemnitee’s
good faith belief that the Indemnitee has met the standard of conduct required to be eligible for
indemnification; and (b) a written undertaking, constituting an unlimited general obligation of
the Indemnitee, to repay the advance if it is ultimately determined that the Indemnitee did not
meet the required standard of conduct. Upon satisfaction of the foregoing the Indemnitee shall]
have a contractual right to the prompt payment of such expenses by the Company within ten (10)
calendar days thereafter.

4.12. Settlement. The Company shall not be liable to indemnify Indemnitee for any amounts
paid in settlement of any Proceeding without the Company's written consent. The Company
shall not settle any Proceeding in any manner which would impose any penalty or limitation on
Indemnitee without Indemnitee’s written consent. Neither the Company nor Indemnitee may
unreasonably withhold its consent to a proposed settlement,

4.13. Contract and Related Rights.

(a) Contract Rights, The right of an Indemnitee to indemnification and
advancement of expenses is a contract right upon which the Indemnitee shall be presumed to
have relied in determining to serve or to continue to serve in his or her capacity with the
Company. Such right shall continue as long as the Indemnitee shall be subject to any possible
Proceeding. Any amendment to or repeal of this Article shall not adversely affect any right or
protection of an Indemnitee with respect to any acts or omissions of such Indemnitee occurring
prior to such amendment or repeal.

(b) Optional Insurance, Contracts, and Funding. The Company may purchase
and maintain insurance on behalf of an individual who is or was a director, officer, employee, or

Agent of the Company or, who, while a director, officer, employee, or Agent of the Company, is
or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, or
Agent of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee
benefit plan, or other enterprise against Liability asserted against or incurred by the individual in
that capacity or arising from the individual’s status as a director, officer, employee, or Agent,
whether or not the Company would have power to indemnify the individual against such
Liability under RCW 23B.08.510 or 23B.08.520.

(c) Severability. If any provision or application of this Article shall be invalid

or unenforceable, the remainder of this Article and its remaining applications shall not be
affected thereby, and shal! continue in full force and effect.

WESTW223481551.3 , 20

(d) Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit. If either (1) a claim under this Article
IV for indemnification is not paid in full by the Company within sixty (60) days after a written
claim has been received by the Company or (2) a claim under this Article IV for advancement of
expenses is not paid in full by the Company within twenty (20) days after a written claim has
been received by the Company, then the Indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against
the Company to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. To the extent successful in whole or in
part, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to also be paid the expense (to be proportionately prorated
if the Indemnitee is only partially successful) of prosecuting such claim, Neither (1) the failure
of the Company to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such Proceeding
that indemnification or reimbursement or advancement of expenses to the Indemnitee is proper
in the circumstances, nor (2) an actual determination by the Company that the Indemnitee is not
entitled to indemnification or to the reimbursement or advancement of expenses, shall be a
defense to the Proceeding or create a presumption that the Indemnitee is not so entitled.

(e) Nonexclusivity of Rights. The right to indemnification and the payment
of expenses incurred in defending a Proceeding in advance of its final disposition granted in this
Article IV shall not be exclusive of any other right which any Indemnitee may have or hereafter
acquire under any statute, provision of this Article or the bylaws, agreement, vote of
shareholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise. The Company shall have the express right
to grant additional indemnity without seeking further approval or satisfaction by the
shareholders. All applicable indemnity provisions and any applicable law shall be interpreted
and applied so as to provide an Indemnitee with the broadest but nonduplicative indemnity to
which he or she is entitled.

4.14, Contribution. If the indemnification provided in Section 4.2 is not available to be paid
to Indemnitee for any reason other than those set forth in Sections 4.2(a), 4.2(b) or 4.2(c) (for
example, because indemnification is held to be against public policy even though otherwise
permitted under Section 4.2) then in respect of any Proceeding in which the Company is jointly
liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such Proceeding), the Company shal! contribute
to the amount of loss paid or payable by Indemnitee in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect: the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Indemnitee on the
other hand from the transaction from which such Proceeding arose, and the relative fault of the
Company on the one hand and the Indemnitee on the other hand in connection with the events
which resulted in such loss, as well as any other relevant equitable consideration. The relative
benefits received by and fautt of the Company on the one hand and the Indemnitee on the other
shall be determined by a court of appropriate jurisdiction (which may be the same court in which
the Proceeding took place) with reference to, among other things, the parties’ relative intent,
knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent the circumstances
resulting in such loss. The Company agrees that it would not be just and equitable if a
contribution pursuant to this Article was determined by pro rata allocation or any other method
of allocation which does not take account of the foregoing equitable considerations.

4,15. Exceptions. Any other provision herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company
shal! not be obligated pursuant to the terms of the Articles to indemnify or advance expenses to
Indemnitee with respect to any Proceeding: (a) initiated voluntarily by Indemnitee and not by
way of defense, unless (x) approved or authorized in advance by the Board of Directors, (y)
brought to establish or enforce a right to indemnification under the Articles or any other statute

WEST\223481551.3 2)

or law or (z) as otherwise required under the statute; (b) instituted by Indemnitee to enforce or
interpret this Article, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that each of the material
assertions made by Indemnitee in such Proceeding was not made in good faith or was frivolous;
(c)} for which any of the expenses or liabilities for indemnification is being sought have been paid
directly to Indemnitee by an insurance carrier under a policy of officers’ and directors’ liability
insurance maintained by the Company; or (d) if the Company is prohibited by applicable law as
then in effect from paying such indemnification and/or advancement of expenses,
