RESOLVED, that the Prior Restated Certificate of this corporation be amended and

Incorporation”):

ARTICLE I
The name of this corporation shall be “Alimera Sciences, Inc.” (the “Corporation”).

The purpose for which the Corporation is organized is to engage in any lawful act or

ARTICLE IV

The Corporation shall have the authority to issue 156,571,694 shares of capital stock,
$0.01 par value per share, of which 90,000,000 shares shall be designated Common Stock (the
“Common Stock”) and 66,571,694 shares shall be designated Preferred Stock (the “Preferred
Stock”), of which 22,524,545 shares of Preferred Stock shall be designated Series A Preferred

GDSVF&H\
Stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock’’), 24,302,903 shares of Preferred Stock shall be designated
Series B Preferred Stock (the “Series B Preferred Stock”) and 19,744,246 shares of Preferred
Stock shall be designated Series C Preferred Stock (the ‘‘Series C Preferred Stock’’). The Series
A Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock shall have the
rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions set forth below in Article V.

ARTICLE V

The rights, preferences, privileges, restrictions and other matters relating to the Series A
Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock are as follows.

A. Dividends.

1. Dividend Accruals and Payments. The holder of each share of Series A
Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock shall be entitled,
consistent with Delaware law, to receive, out of the assets of the Corporation legally available
therefor, cumulative dividends at an annual rate of eight percent (8.0%) on the Series A Original
Price (as defined in Section E below), the Series B Original Price (as defined in Section E below)
or the Series C Original Price (as defined in Section E below), as applicable (subject in each case
to adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other similar
recapitalization affecting such shares). Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the failure or
inability of the Corporation to redeem any shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred
Stock or Series C Preferred Stock when due pursuant to Section C below, whether as a result of
legal restrictions or otherwise, the annual dividend rate on such Series A Preferred Stock, Series
B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock shall thereafter be increased to twelve percent
(12.0%). All such dividends shall be calculated based on a 365-day year, shall be cumulative
and shall accrue, whether or not declared, on each share of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock. Such dividends shall be due and payable with
respect to a share of Preferred Stock (i) when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation, (ii) upon a Liquidating Event (as defined below), or (iii) upon redemption of such
share of Preferred Stock pursuant to Section C below. The Board of Directors of the Corporation
may fix in advance a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Preferred Stock
entitled to receive payment of any dividend thereon, which record date shall be no more than
thirty (30) calendar days and no less than ten (10) calendar days prior to the date fixed for the
payment thereof.

No cash dividend or other distribution (other than a stock dividend giving rise to an
adjustment under Section F hereof and made in accordance with the provisions of this Restated
Certificate of Incorporation) shall be paid, or declared and set apart for payment, on any share of
Common Stock, nor shall any share of Common Stock be repurchased or redeemed by the
Corporation (other than acquisitions of Common Stock by the Corporation pursuant to
agreements which permit the Corporation to repurchase such shares at cost (or the lesser of cost
or fair market value) upon termination of services to the Corporation) unless (i) all accrued but
unpaid dividends on all shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to the first paragraph of this
Subsection A.1 as of the date of such dividend or other distribution have been paid in full, and
(ii) a pro rata cash dividend or other distribution is paid, or declared and set apart for payment,
with respect to all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock based on the number of shares of

GDSVF&H\ 2
Common Stock into which such shares of Preferred Stock are then convertible pursuant to
Section E hereof as of the record date for determination of the holders of capital stock of the
Corporation entitled to such dividend or distribution; provided, however, that in determining the
Series A Conversion Ratio for the aforesaid calculation each share of Series A Preferred Stock
shall first be deemed to have been paid a dividend payment in the amount of the applicable
Convertible Dividend.

2. Ratable Allocation of Dividends. If at any time the Corporation pays a
dividend or distribution on the Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of
dividends then accrued or declared and payable with respect to all shares of Preferred Stock,
such payment will be distributed ratably among the holders of shares of Preferred Stock pro rata
in proportion to the accrued or declared dividends that are then unpaid for the shares of Preferred
Stock held by each such holder up to the aggregate amount of all dividends accrued or otherwise
payable on such Preferred Stock.

B. Preference on Liquidation.

1. Upon the occurrence of any Liquidating Event, before any payment shall
be made in respect of the Corporation’s Common Stock, (i) each holder of Series A Preferred
Stock then outstanding shall be paid, out of the assets of the Corporation available for
distribution to its stockholders, an amount equal to the Series A Original Price per share of Series
A Preferred Stock, plus accrued or declared dividends that are then unpaid for each share of
Series A Preferred Stock then held by them (the “Series A Preference Amount”), (ii) each holder
of Series B Preferred Stock then outstanding shall be paid, out of the assets of the Corporation
available for distribution to its stockholders, an amount equal to the Series B Original Price per
share of Series B Preferred Stock, plus accrued or declared dividends that are then unpaid for
each share of Series B Preferred Stock then held by them (the “Series B Preference Amount”)
and (iit) each holder of Series C Preferred Stock then outstanding shall be paid, out of the assets
of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders, an amount equal to the Series C
Original Price per share of Series C Preferred Stock, plus accrued or declared dividends that are
then unpaid for each share of Series C Preferred Stock then held by them (the “Series C
Preference Amount”), subject in each case to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock
dividend, stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization affecting such shares. If, upon
the occurrence of a Liquidating Event, the assets and funds distributed among the holders of
Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full aforesaid
Series A Preference Amount, Series B Preference Amount and Series C Preference Amount, as
applicable, then the entire assets and funds of the Corporation legally available for distribution
shall be distributed ratably among the holders of Preferred Stock in proportion to the aggregate
of the Series A Preference Amount, the Series B Preference Amount and the Series C Preference
Amount (collectively, the “Preference Amount”) each such holder is entitled to receive. After
payment has been made to the holders of Preferred Stock of the full Preference Amount to which
they shall be entitled as aforesaid, any remaining assets of the Corporation legally available for
distribution, if any, shall be distributed ratably among the holders of the Corporation’s Common
Stock and Preferred Stock as if such shares of Preferred Stock had been converted voluntarily
into Common Stock immediately prior to such Liquidating Event; provided, however, that in
determining the Series A Conversion Ratio for the aforesaid calculation each share of Series A

GDSVF&M\ 3
Preferred Stock shall first be deemed to have been paid a dividend payment in the amount of the
applicable Convertible Dividend.

2. Written notice of any such Liquidating Event stating a payment date, the
place where such payment shall be made, the amount of each payment in liquidation and the
amount of dividends to be paid shall be given by first class mail, postage prepaid, not less than
ten (10) days prior to the payment date stated therein, to each holder of record of the Preferred
Stock at such holder’s address as shown in the records of the Corporation; provided, that such
ten (10) day notice period may be shortened or waived upon the affirmative vote or written
consent of the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock,
consenting or voting separately as a single class; and, provided further, that, to the extent not
waived, any holder of Preferred Stock may convert its shares of Preferred Stock to Common
Stock during such ten (10) day (or lesser) notice period at any time prior to the payment date
stated in such notice.

3. A “Liquidating Event’ shall mean (a) any liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation, either voluntary or involuntary, or (b) a transaction or series of
related transactions resulting in any of the following: (1) a sale, lease, transfer, exchange or
other disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Corporation, (2) a merger,
consolidation, sale or reorganization as a result of which stockholders of the Corporation
immediately prior to such merger, consolidation, sale or reorganization either (A) possess less
than 50% of the voting power of the acquiring, surviving or successor entity immediately
following such merger, consolidation, sale or reorganization or (B) do not possess the voting
power of the acquiring, surviving or successor entity immediately following such merger,
consolidation, sale or reorganization in substantially the same proportions as such stockholders
possessed immediately prior thereto, or (3) the transfer by one or more stockholders of the
Corporation of securities of the Corporation representing 50% or more of the combined voting
power of the then outstanding securities of the Corporation; provided, however, if the holders of
a majority of the shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding so elect by giving written notice to
the Corporation before the effective date of a merger, consolidation, sale or reorganization that
would otherwise be a Liquidating Event as defined herein, such merger, consolidation, sale or
reorganization shall not be deemed a Liquidating Event and the provisions of Subsection E.7
shall apply, and provided further, that a “Liquidating Event” shall not include any transaction or
series of related transactions principally undertaken for bona fide equity financing purposes in
which cash is received by the Corporation or any successor or indebtedness of the Corporation is
cancelled or converted, or a combination thereof. Upon the occurrence of any Liquidating Event
that would involve the distribution of assets other than cash with respect to the outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock, the amount of such distribution shall be the fair market value thereof
at the time of such distribution as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation, and any securities to be distributed in such event shall be valued as follows.

(a) Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar
restrictions on free marketability covered by subsection (ii) hereof:

(i) if traded on a securities exchange or through the Nasdaq
Global Market or Nasdaq Capital Market, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the

GDSVF&H\ 4
closing prices of the securities on such exchange over the 30 day period ending three (3) business
days prior to the closing;

(ii) if actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the 30
day period ending three (3) business days prior to the closing; and

(iii) if there is no active public market, the value shall be the
fair market value thereof, as reasonably determined by the Board of Directors of the Corporation
in good faith.

(b) The method of valuation of securities subject to investment letter
or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of a
stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount
from the market value determined as provided in clauses (A), (B) or (C) of subsection (i) hereof,
to reflect the adjusted fair market value thereof, as reasonably determined by the Board of
Directors of the Corporation in good faith.

C. Redemption.

1. At any time following the fifth (Sth) anniversary of the date of the filing of
this Restated Certificate, to the extent all shares of Preferred Stock have not been previously
redeemed or converted, the holders of a majority of the shares of Preferred Stock then
outstanding (the “Electing Holders”), voting together as a single class, may require the
Corporation, to the extent that it may lawfully do so, to redeem, subject to the provisions of this
Subsection C.1, all of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock in three (3) annual
installments (each date on which such redemption occurs, a “Redemption Date”); provided that
the Corporation shall receive written notice (the “Redemption Notice”) from the Electing
Holders requesting such redemption in accordance with this Section C. The number of shares of
Preferred Stock that the Corporation shall be required to redeem on any one Redemption Date
shall be equal to the amount determined by dividing (A) the aggregate number of shares of
Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Redemption Date by (B) the number of
remaining Redemption Dates (including the Redemption Date to which such calculation applies).
Shares subject to redemption pursuant to this Section C.1 shall be redeemed from each holder of
Preferred Stock on a pro rata basis, based on the number of shares of Preferred Stock then held.
Promptly following receipt by the Corporation of the Redemption Notice (but in no event later
than thirty (30) days following receipt by the Corporation of the Redemption Notice), the
Electing Holders and the Corporation shall set the initial Redemption Date, such initial
Redemption Date to occur within one hundred eighty (180) days following receipt by the
Corporation of the Redemption Notice. The Corporation shall redeem such shares of Preferred
Stock at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) the Series A Preference Amount, the Series
B Preference Amount or the Series C Preference Amount, as applicable, as of the applicable
Redemption Date, or (ii) the fair market value per share of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock or the Series C Preferred Stock, as applicable, as of the applicable Redemption
Date (the determination of the current fair market value of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock, as applicable, as of the applicable Redemption Date
(without any discount for minority ownership interest, illiquidity or otherwise) to be based on a

GDSVF&H\ 5
valuation of the Corporation as finally determined by an independent third party appraiser
mutually acceptable to the Board of Directors (excluding those members of the Board of
Directors elected solely by the holders of Preferred Stock pursuant to Subsection D.3) and the
holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock) as of the
applicable Redemption Date (such greater amount with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock,
Series B Preferred Stock or the Series C Preferred Stock, as applicable, the “Redemption Price’),
from any source of funds legally available therefor, until all shares of Preferred Stock for which
redemption has been so requested have been redeemed or converted. If no funds or insufficient
funds are legally available at the time of any Redemption Date to redeem all of the shares of
Preferred Stock then due to be redeemed, then the Corporation shall redeem shares of Preferred
Stock from holders thereof pro rata based upon the aggregate Redemption Price of the shares to
be redeemed, and shall redeem the remaining shares to be redeemed as soon as sufficient funds
are legally available. Shares of Preferred Stock that are subject to redemption but that have not
been redeemed and the Redemption Price paid or set aside with respect thereto due to
insufficient legally available funds shall continue to be entitled to the dividend, conversion and
other rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of such Preferred Stock until such shares
have been redeemed and the Redemption Price has been paid or set aside thereto.

2. At least twenty (20) calendar days but not more than sixty (60) calendar
days prior to each Redemption Date, written notice (the “Company Redemption Notice’’) shall be
mailed, postage prepaid, by the Corporation to each holder of Preferred Stock to be redeemed on
such Redemption Date at its post office address last shown on the records of the Corporation,
specifying the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price, the place at which payment may be
obtained and the date on which such holder’s conversion rights as to such shares terminate, and
calling upon such holder to surrender to the Corporation, in the manner and at the place
designated, his, her or its certificate or certificates representing the shares of Preferred Stock to
be redeemed on the next Redemption Date. On a Redemption Date, the Redemption Price of
such shares shall be payable to the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or
certificates as the owner thereof and each surrendered certificate shall be cancelled. In the event
less than all the shares represented by such certificates are redeemed, a new certificate shall be
issued representing the unissued shares. From and after a Redemption Date, unless there shall
have been a default in payment of the Redemption Price, all dividends on the Preferred Stock
redeemed on such Redemption Date shall cease to accrue, all rights of the holders of such shares
as holders of Preferred Stock of the Corporation (except the right to receive the Redemption
Price upon surrender of their certificate or certificates) shall cease with respect to such shares,
and such shares shall not thereafter be transferred on the books of the Corporation or be deemed
to be outstanding for any purpose whatsoever. Each holder of shares of Preferred Stock to be
redeemed on such Redemption Date shall surrender the certificate or certificates representing
such shares to the Corporation at the Corporation’s principal executive office on or before the
applicable Redemption Date, and thereupon the Corporation shall pay the Redemption Price for
such shares to be paid as described in Subsection C.1 in immediately available funds, by wire
transfer to an account designated by the holder of such shares or by certified or bank check
payable to the order of such holder. Each stock certificate surrendered for redemption shall be
canceled and retired.

3. On or prior to each Redemption Date, the Corporation shall deposit the
Redemption Price of all shares of Preferred Stock designated for redemption in the Company

GDSVF&H\ 6
Redemption Notice and not yet converted with a bank or trust company having aggregate capital
and surplus in excess of $25,000,000 as a trust fund for the benefit of the holders of the shares
designated for redemption. Any moneys deposited by the Corporation pursuant to this
Subsection C.3 for the redemption of shares that are thereafter converted into shares of Common
Stock pursuant to Section E hereof shall be returned to the Corporation forthwith upon such
conversion. The balance of any moneys deposited by the Corporation pursuant to this
Subsection C.3 remaining unclaimed at the expiration of ninety (90) days following the third and
final Redemption Date shall thereafter be returned to the Corporation upon its request expressed
in a resolution of its Board of Directors, after which the holders of such shares called for
redemption shall be entitled only to receive payment of the Redemption Price from the
Corporation.

D. Voting.

l, General Rights. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or as
required by law, the holder of each share of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to the number of
votes equal to the number of shares of Common Stock into which such share of Preferred Stock
could then be converted and shall have voting rights and powers equal to the voting rights and
powers of the Common Stock (except as otherwise expressly provided herein or as required by
law, voting together with the Common Stock as a single class) and shall be entitled to notice of
any stockholders’ meeting in accordance with the Bylaws of the Corporation. Fractional votes
shall not, however, be permitted and any fractional voting rights resulting from the above
formula (after aggregating all shares of Common Stock into which shares of Preferred Stock held
by each holder could be converted) shall be reduced to the nearest whole number.

2. Protective Provisions.

this Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Corporation shall not, without first obtaining the

of the Corporation’s business and upon fair and reasonable terms at least as fair as could have

Corporation;

(xili) cause the Corporation to become subject to any agreement

with the issuance of shares of Preferred Stock;

take any of the following actions (whether by merger, consolidation, recapitalization or

GDSVF&H\ 9

rights of the Series A Preferred Stock under Section F.3 below.

3. Election of Directors. The number of directors of the Corporation shall be
set in accordance with the Corporation’s Bylaws. For so long as any shares of Preferred Stock
remain outstanding, at each meeting of the stockholders held for the election of directors, or
upon the taking of a written consent of stockholders for such purpose, the holders of Preferred
Stock shall be entitled, voting as a separate class, to elect five (5) members of the Board of
Directors of the Corporation. All remaining directors of the Corporation shall be elected by the
holders of Common Stock and Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class on an as-
converted basis. In the case of any vacancy (other than a vacancy caused by removal by vote of
the stockholders in accordance with applicable law or this Restated Certificate of Incorporation)
in the office of a director occurring among the directors elected by the holders of Preferred Stock
pursuant to this Subsection C.3, the remaining directors so elected by the Preferred Stock may,
by affirmative vote of a majority thereof (or the remaining director so elected if there be but one,
or if there are no such directors remaining, by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of
the shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class on an as-converted basis), elect a
successor or successors to hold office for the unexpired term of the director or directors whose
place or places shall be vacant. Any director who shall have been elected by the holders of
Preferred Stock or by any directors so elected as provided in the immediately preceding sentence
hereof may be removed during the aforesaid term of office, either with or without cause, by, and
only by, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Preferred Stock, in
accordance with the Bylaws of the Corporation, given either at a special meeting of such
stockholders duly called for that purpose or pursuant to a written consent of stockholders, and
any vacancy thereby created may be filled by the holders of a majority of the shares of the
Preferred Stock represented at a meeting or pursuant to written consent.

E. Conversion Rights. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible at the
option of the holder thereof, at any time after the issuance of such share, into fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock of the Corporation. The number of shares of Common
Stock into which each share of the Series A Preferred Stock may be converted shall be
determined by multiplying each share of Series A Preferred Stock by a fraction (the “Series A
Conversion Ratio”) (1) the numerator of which is the sum of (a) $1.18565 plus (b) an amount
(which shall not be less than zero) equal to the Convertible Dividend (as defined below) for such
share of Series A Preferred Stock minus the amount of the Convertible Dividend that previously
has been paid with respect to such share of Series A Preferred Stock, and (2) the denominator of

GDSVF&H\ 10
which is the Series A Conversion Price (determined as hereinafter provided) in effect at the time
of the conversion. The “Convertible Dividend” means, with respect to each share of Series A
Preferred Stock, the amount of the accrued and unpaid dividends on such share of Series A
Preferred Stock from the original issuance date of such share through November 17, 2005. The
number of shares of Common Stock into which each share of the Series B Preferred Stock may
be converted shall be determined by multiplying each share of Series B Preferred Stock by a
fraction (the “Series B Conversion Ratio”) (1) the numerator of which is $1.31084 and (2) the
denominator of which is the Series B Conversion Price (determined as hereinafter provided) in
effect at the time of the conversion. The number of shares of Common Stock into which each
share of the Series C Preferred Stock may be converted shall be determined by multiplying each
share of Series C Preferred Stock by a fraction (the “Series C Conversion Ratio”) (1) the
numerator of which is $ $1.51943 and (2) the denominator of which is the Series C Conversion
Price (determined as hereinafter provided) in effect at the time of the conversion. For avoidance
of doubt, any accrued and unpaid dividend (other than the Convertible Dividend) with respect to
any share of Preferred Stock shall be disregarded upon conversion of such share Preferred Stock
and upon such conversion the right of the holder of such share of Preferred Stock to receive such
accrued and unpaid dividend shall terminate.

For purposes of determining the Series A Conversion Ratio, dividends paid on any share
of Series A Preferred Stock shall be applied first to the payment of all unpaid dividends on such
share of Series A Preferred Stock that have accrued after November 21, 2005 and then to the
payment of the Convertible Dividend with respect to such share of Series A Preferred Stock.

1. Conversion Price. Before any adjustment pursuant to Section F hereof,
the Series A Conversion Price shall be equal to $1.18565 (the “Series A Original Price”), the
Series B Conversion Price shall be equal to $1.31084 (the “Series B Original Price’) and the
Series C Conversion Price shall be equal to $ $1.51943 (the “Series C Original Price”).

2. Mechanics of Conversion. The holder of any shares of Preferred Stock
may exercise the conversion rights as to such shares or any part thereof by delivering to the
Corporation during regular business hours, at the office of any transfer agent of the Corporation
for the Preferred Stock, or at the principal office of the Corporation or at such other place as may
be designated by the Corporation, the certificate or certificates for the shares to be converted,
duly endorsed for transfer to the Corporation or accompanied by a written instrument or
instruments of transfer (if required by it), accompanied by written notice stating that the holder
elects to convert all or a number of such shares represented by the certificate or certificates.
Such notice shall also state such holder’s name or the names of the nominees in which such
holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued.
Conversion shall be deemed to have been effected on the date when such delivery is made, and
such date is referred to herein as the “Conversion Date.” As promptly as practicable thereafter
the Corporation shall issue and deliver to such holder, at such office or other place designated by
the Corporation, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock to
which such holder is entitled and a check for cash with respect to any fractional interest in a
share of Common Stock as provided in Subsection E.3 below. All shares of Preferred Stock
which shal] have been surrendered for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed
to be outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares, including the rights, if any, to receive
notices and to vote, shall immediately cease and terminate upon the Conversion Date, except

GDSVF&H\ 11
only the right of the holder thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor.
The holder shall be deemed to have become a stockholder of record with respect to the shares of
Common Stock on the applicable Conversion Date. Upon conversion of only a portion of the
number of shares of Preferred Stock represented by a certificate surrendered for conversion, the
Corporation shall issue and deliver to the holder of the certificate so surrendered for conversion,
at the expense of the Corporation, a new certificate covering the number of shares of Preferred
Stock representing the unconverted portion of the certificate so surrendered.

3. Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock or scrip shall be
issued upon conversion of shares of Preferred Stock. If more than one share of Preferred Stock
shall be surrendered for conversion at any one time by the same holder, the number of full shares
of Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the
aggregate number of shares of Preferred Stock so surrendered. Instead of any fractional shares
of Common Stock that would otherwise be issuable upon conversion of any shares of Preferred
Stock, the Corporation shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fractional interest equal to
the fair market value of such fractional interest as determined in good faith by the Corporation’s
Board of Directors.

4. Payment of Taxes. The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and
transfer taxes that may be payable in respect of any issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock
on conversion of the Preferred Stock pursuant hereto. The Corporation shall not, however, be
required to pay any tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue and
delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in which the Preferred Stock so
converted was registered, and no such issue or delivery shall be made unless and until the person
requesting such issue has paid to the Corporation the amount of any such tax or has established,
to the satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax has been paid.

5. Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at
all times reserve and keep available, out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock, solely for

the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Preferred Stock, the full number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable upon the conversion of all the Preferred Stock from time to time
outstanding. The Corporation shall from time to time use its best effort to obtain necessary
director and stockholder approvals, in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, to
increase the authorized amount of its Common Stock if at any time the authorized amount of its
Common Stock remaining unissued shall not be sufficient to permit the conversion of all of the
shares of Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, and shall take all such actions as are necessary
to increase such authorized amount of Common Stock upon obtaining such approvals. Before
taking any action that would cause an adjustment reducing the Series A Conversion Price, the
Series B Conversion Price or the Series C Conversion Price below the then-par value of the
shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, the
Series B Preferred Stock or the Series C Preferred Stock, as applicable, the Corporation will take
any corporate action that may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the
Corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock
at such adjusted Series A Conversion Price, the Series B Conversion Price or Series C
Conversion Price, as applicable.

GDSVF&H\ 12
6. Adjustment _for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. If the
Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be changed into the

same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by capital
reorganization, reclassification, or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares
or stock dividend provided for in Subsection F.1), then and in each such event the holder of each
share of Preferred Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such share into the kind and
amount of shares of stock and other securities and property receivable upon such reorganization,
reclassification, or other change, by holders of the number of shares of Common Stock into
which such shares of Preferred Stock might have been converted immediately prior to such
reorganization, reclassification, or change.

7. Reorganizations, Mergers or Consolidations. In case of any consolidation
or merger of the Corporation with or into another corporation (other than a consolidation, merger

or sale treated as a Liquidating Event pursuant to Subsection B.3 above), each share of Preferred
Stock shall thereafter be convertible into the kind and amount of shares of stock or other
securities or property to which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the
Corporation deliverable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred
Stock or the Series C Preferred Stock, as applicable, would have been entitled upon such
consolidation, merger or sale; and in such case, appropriate adjustment (as determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation) shall be made in the application of the
provisions of Sections E and F with respect to the rights and interest thereafter of the holders of
Preferred Stock, to the end that the provisions set forth in Sections E and F shall thereafter be
applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any shares of stock or other property
thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock.

8. Listing of Shares Issuable Upon Conversion. If any shares of Common
Stock to be reserved for the purpose of conversion of shares of Preferred Stock require

registration or listing with, or approval of, any governmental authority, stock exchange or other
regulatory body under any federal or state law or regulation or otherwise, before such shares may
be validly issued or delivered upon conversion, the Corporation will in good faith and as
expeditiously as possible endeavor to secure such registration, listing or approval, as the case
may be.

9. Valid Issuance. All shares of Common Stock that may be issued upon
conversion of the shares of Preferred Stock will, upon issuance by the Corporation, be validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free from all taxes, liens and charges with respect to the
issuance thereof.

10. No Dilution or Impairment. The Corporation will not, without first
obtaining any vote(s) required by Section D.2 of this Article V, by amendment of this Restated
Certificate of Incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation,
merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to
avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder
by the Corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all of the
provisions of Sections E and F and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or
appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holders of Preferred Stock against
impairment.

GDSVF&H\ 13
F. Adjustment of Conversion Price. The Conversion Price from time to time in
effect shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows.

1. Stock Splits, Dividends and Combinations. In case the Corporation shall
at any time subdivide the outstanding shares of Common Stock or shall issue a dividend in
Common Stock on its outstanding Common Stock without a corresponding subdivision of or
dividend on the Preferred Stock, the Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred Stock, the
Series B Preferred Stock and the Series C Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such
subdivision or the issuance of such dividend shall be proportionately decreased, and in case the
Corporation shall at any time combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a lesser
number of shares of Common Stock without a corresponding combination of the Preferred Stock,
the Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock or the Series
C Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such combination shall be proportionately
increased, concurrently with the effectiveness of such subdivision, dividend or combination, as
the case may be.

2. Noncash Dividends, Stock Purchase Rights, Capital Reorganizations and
Dissolutions. In case:

(a) the Corporation shall take a record of the holders of its Common
Stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend or any other distribution, payable
otherwise than in cash; or

(b) the Corporation shall take a record of the holders of its Common
Stock for the purpose of entitling them to subscribe for or purchase any shares of stock of any
class or to receive any other rights; or

(c) of any capital reorganization of the Corporation, reclassification of
the capital stock of the Corporation (other than a subdivision or combination of its outstanding
shares of Common Stock), consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into another
Corporation that is not a Liquidating Event or conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets
of the Corporation to another corporation that is not a Liquidating Event;

then, and in any such case, the Corporation shall cause to be mailed to the transfer agent for the
Preferred Stock and to the holders of record of the outstanding Preferred Stock, at least ten (10)
days prior to the date hereinafter specified, a notice stating the date on which (i) a record is to be
taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or rights, or (ii) such reclassification,
reorganization, consolidation, merger, conveyance, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is to
take place and the date, if any is to be fixed, as of which holders of Common Stock of record
shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock for securities or other property
deliverable upon such reclassification, reorganization, consolidation, merger, conveyance,
dissolution, liquidation or winding up.

3. Issuances at Less Than the Conversion Price. Upon the issuance or sale
by the Corporation of:

GDSVF&H\ 14
(a) Common Stock for a consideration per share less than any Series A
Conversion Price, any Series B Conversion Price or any Series C Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to the time of such issue or sale; or

(b) any Stock Purchase Rights (as hereinafter defined) where the
consideration per share for which shares of Common Stock may at any time thereafter be
issuable upon exercise thereof (or, in the case of Stock Purchase Rights exercisable for the
purchase of Convertible Securities (as hereinafter defined), upon the subsequent conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities) shall be less than any Series A Conversion Price, Series
B Conversion Price or Series C Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the time of the
issue or sale of such Stock Purchase Rights; or

(c) any Convertible Securities where the consideration per share for
which shares of Common Stock may at any time thereafter be issuable pursuant to the terms of
such Convertible Securities shall be less than any Series A Conversion Price, Series B
Conversion Price or Series C Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the time of the
issue or sale of such Convertible Securities;

other than an issuance of Common Stock pursuant to Subsections F.] or F.6 hereof (any such
issuance shall be referred to hereinafter as a “Dilutive Issuance”), then, if such Dilutive Issuance
occurs prior to February 26, 2010 with respect to the Series C Preferred Stock, forthwith upon
such issue or sale, the Series C Conversion Price, shall be reduced concurrently with such issue
to a price equal to the lowest per share consideration actually received by the Corporation for
such Common Stock or Common Stock underlying such Stock Purchase Rights or Convertible
Securities in such Dilutive Issuance. If a Dilutive Issuance occurs on or after July 7, 2007 with
respect to the Series A Preferred Stock, November 22, 2007 with respect to the Series B
Preferred Stock or February 26, 2010 with respect to the Series C Preferred Stock, then forthwith
upon such issue or sale, the Series A Conversion Price, the Series B Conversion Price or the
Series C Conversion Price, as applicable, shall be reduced concurrently with such issue in order
to increase the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Series A Preferred Stock,
Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock, as applicable, is convertible to a price
(calculated to the nearest cent) determined by the following formula:

cp! =cp+Nt©
N+AS
where:
CP' = the Conversion Price as so adjusted;
CP = the former Conversion Price immediately prior to the Dilutive Issuance;
N = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to

such issuance (or deemed issuance) assuming exercise or conversion of all
outstanding Convertible Securities and Stock Purchase Rights;

C = the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration
received or deemed to be received by the Corporation for the total number

GDSVF&H\ 15
of additional securities so issued or deemed to be issued would purchase if
the purchase price per share were equal to CP; and

AS = the number of shares of Common Stock so issued or deemed to be issued.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Conversion Price shall at such time be reduced if such
reduction would be an amount less than $.01, but any such amount shall be carried forward and
deduction with respect thereto made at the time of and together with any subsequent reduction
that, together with such amount and any other amount or amounts so carried forward, shall
aggregate $.01 or more.

4, Defined Terms. For purposes of this Section F, the following provisions
will be applicable.

(a) “Convertible Securities” shall mean evidences of indebtedness,
shares of stock (including, without limitation, the Preferred Stock) or other securities that are
convertible into or exchangeable for, with or without payment of additional consideration, shares
of Common Stock.

(b) “Stock Purchase Rights” shall mean any warrants, options or other
rights to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of Common Stock or any
Convertible Securities.

(c) Convertible Securities and Stock Purchase Rights shall be deemed
outstanding and issued or sold at the time of such issue or sale.

5. Determination of Consideration. The “consideration actually received” by
the Corporation for the issuance, sale, grant or assumption of shares of Common Stock, Stock
Purchase Rights or Convertible Securities, irrespective of the accounting treatment of such
consideration, shall be valued as follows:

(a) in the case of cash, the net amount received by the Corporation
after deduction of any accrued interest or dividends and before deducting any expenses paid or
incurred and any underwriting commissions or concessions paid or allowed by the Corporation
in connection with such issue or sale;

(b) in the case of consideration other than cash, the fair market value
of such consideration, which shall not include the value of any Convertible Securities being
converted or exchanged, as determined by the Board of Directors of the Corporation in good
faith, after deducting any accrued interest or dividends; and

(c) with respect to the issuance of Stock Purchase Rights and
Convertible Securities, the total consideration, if any, received by the Corporation as
consideration for the issuance of the Stock Purchase Rights or the Convertible Securities, as the
case may be, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to
the Corporation upon the exercise of such Stock Purchase Rights or upon the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, as the case may be, in each case after deducting any
accrued interest or dividends.

GDSVF&H\ 16
In the event of any change in (i) the consideration, if any, payable upon exercise of any Stock
Purchase Rights or upon the conversion or exchange of any Convertible Securities, or (ii) the rate
at which any Convertible Securities are convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Common
Stock, the Conversion Price as computed upon the original issue thereof shall forthwith be
readjusted to the Conversion Price that would have been in effect at such time had such Stock
Purchase Rights or Convertible Securities provided for such changed purchase price,
consideration or conversion rate, as the case may be, at the time initially granted, issued or sold.
On the expiration of any Stock Purchase Rights not exercised or of any right to convert or
exchange under any Convertible Securities not exercised, the Conversion Price then in effect
shall forthwith be increased to the Conversion Price that would have been in effect at the time of
such expiration had such Stock Purchase Rights or Convertible Securities never been issued. No
readjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this paragraph shall (A) increase the
Conversion Price by an amount in excess of the adjustment originally made to the Conversion
Price in respect of the issue, sale or grant of the applicable Stock Purchase Rights or Convertible
Securities, or (B) require any adjustment to the amount paid or number of shares of Common
Stock received by any holder of Preferred Stock upon any conversion of any share of Preferred
Stock prior to the date upon which such readjustment to the Conversion Price shall occur.

6. Exclusions for Adjustment for Issuances at Less Than the Conversion
Price. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Corporation shall not be required to

make any adjustment of any Conversion Price in the case of: (a) the issuance of shares of
Common Stock upon exercise of stock options issued or issuable pursuant to that certain Alimera
Sciences, Inc. 2004 Incentive Stock Plan adopted on July 7, 2004, or that certain Alimera
Sciences, Inc. 2005 Incentive Stock Plan adopted on November 21, 2005, and as in effect from
time to time, (b) the issuance of securities in a Qualified Public Offering; (c) the issuance of
shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of Preferred Stock or upon exercise of
Convertible Securities or Stock Purchase Rights outstanding on the date this Restated Certificate
of Incorporation is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware; (d) the issuance of
shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock issued by way of dividend or other comparable
distribution on the Preferred Stock; (e) the issuance of shares of Common Stock, or securities
exercisable for or convertible into Common Stock, in the aggregate not to exceed 1,000,000
shares, as adjusted for any stock dividend, split, combination or other similar recapitalization
affecting such shares, of Common Stock, issued to banks or equipment lessors pursuant to
equipment or other financing arrangements (and not principally for the purposes of raising
capital) approved by a majority of the directors selected by the holders of Preferred Stock
pursuant to Subsection D.3 hereof (and if no such directors are in office, each such issuance that
is approved by holders of at least a majority of the outstanding Preferred Stock voting together as
a single class on an as-converted basis); or (f) the issuance of shares of Common Stock, or
securities exercisable for or convertible into Common Stock, in the aggregate not to exceed
1,000,000 shares, as adjusted for any stock dividend, split, combination or other similar
recapitalization affecting such shares, of Common Stock, issued pursuant to a strategic or
collaborative relationship with, or the acquisition of, another company by the Corporation
pursuant to a plan, agreement or other arrangement (and not principally for the purposes of
raising capital) approved by each of the directors selected by the holders of the Preferred Stock
pursuant to Subsection D.3 hereof (and if no such directors are in office, each such issuance that
is approved by holders of a majority of the outstanding Preferred Stock, voting together as a

GDSVF&H\ 17
single class on an as-converted basis). The issuances or sales described in this Subsection F.6
shall be ignored for purposes of calculating any adjustment to any Conversion Price

7. Certificate of Adjustment. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Series A Conversion Price, the Series B Conversion Price or Series C
Conversion Price pursuant to this Section F, the Corporation at its expense shall promptly
compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms thereof, and prepare and
furnish to each holder of Preferred Stock affected thereby a certificate setting forth such
adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or
readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon the written notice at any time of any affected
holder of Preferred Stock furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting
forth (a) such adjustment or readjustment, (b) the Conversion Price at the time in effect, and (c)
the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property that at the time
would be received upon the conversion of such holder’s shares.

G. Mandatory Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be
converted into shares of Common Stock at the then-applicable conversion rate upon the
occurrence of a closing of an underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration
statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, covering the offer and sale of Common
Stock of the Corporation to the public where the Corporation receives proceeds of more than
$50,000,000 (net of underwriters discounts and commissions), and the price per share to the
public is not less than five (5) times the Series A Original Price, subject to adjustment in the
event of any stock dividends, stock splits or the like (a “Qualified Public Offering”). In addition,
each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at
the then applicable conversion rate upon the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority
of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting separately as a single class. All holders
of record of shares of Preferred Stock will be given at least thirty (30) days prior written notice
of the date fixed for mandatory conversion of the Preferred Stock and the event causing the
mandatory conversion of the Preferred Stock into Common Stock. Such notice shall be sent by
first class mail, postage prepaid, to each holder of record of Preferred Stock at such holder’s
address as shown in the records of the Corporation. On or before the date so fixed for
conversion, each holder of shares of the Preferred Stock shall surrender the certificate or
certificates for all such shares to the Corporation at the place designated in such notice and shall
thereafter receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled. All certificates evidencing shares of Preferred Stock which are required to be
surrendered for conversion on such date shall, from and after such date, be deemed to have been
retired and cancelled and the shares of Preferred Stock represented thereby converted into
Common Stock for all purposes, notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to
surrender such certificates on or prior to such date. The mechanics for conversion and other
provisions relating to conversion of Preferred Stock into Common Stock set forth elsewhere in
this Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall apply to the mandatory conversion of the
Preferred Stock.
