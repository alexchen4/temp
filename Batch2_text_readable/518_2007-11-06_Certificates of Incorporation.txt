the Company’s stockholders for the election of directors, and to remove from office such
directors and to fill any vacancy caused by the resignation, death or removal of such directors.

shares entitled to vote for that director as provided above; provided, however, that unless the
entire Board is removed, no individual director may be removed when the votes cast against such
director’s removal, or not consenting in writing to such removal, would be sufficient to elect that
director if voted cumulatively at an election which the same total number of votes were cast (or,
if such action is taken by written consent, all shares entitled to vote were voted) and the entire
number of directors authorized at the time of such director’s most recent election were then being
elected.

consideration) shall be distributed among the holders of SeriesA Preferred at the time
outstanding, ratably in proportion to the full amounts to which they would otherwise be

(b) After payment in full of the Series B Liquidation Preference and
Series A Liquidation Preference, the remaining assets of the Company legally available for

shares of Common Stock in order to participate in any distribution, or series of distributions, as

559892 v7/SD 6.
shares of Common Stock, without first foregoing participation in the distribution, or series of
distributions, as shares of Series Preferred. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a
Liquidation Event, a holder of Series Preferred shall be entitled to receive, for each share of

amount of cash, securities or other property to which such holder would be entitled to receive in
a Liquidation Event pursuant to (i) Section 3(a) above or (ii) the amount of cash, securities or
other property to which such holder would be entitled to receive in a Liquidation Event with
respect to such shares if such shares had been converted to Common Stock immediately prior to
such Liquidation Event.

(a) In the event that the Company is a party to an Acquisition or Asset
Transfer, then each holder of Series Preferred shall be entitled to receive, for each share of Series
Preferred then held, out of the proceeds of such Acquisition or Asset Transfer, the amount of

entity or person, or any other corporate reorganization, other than any such consolidation, merger
or reorganization in which the stockholders of the Company immediately prior to such
consolidation, merger or reorganization, continue to hold at least a majority of the voting power
of the surviving entity in substantially the same proportions (or, if the surviving entity is a wholly
owned subsidiary, its parent) immediately after such consolidation, merger or reorganization; or
(B) any transaction or series of related transactions to which the Company is a party in which in
excess of 50% of the Company’s voting power is transferred; provided that an Acquisition shal]
not include any transaction or series of transactions principally for bona fide equity financing
purposes in which cash is received by the Company or any successor or indebtedness of the
Company is cancelled or converted or a combination thereof; and (ii) “Asset Transfer” shall
mean a sale of al] or substantially all of the assets of the Company or the exclusive license of
substantially all of the rights to substantially all of the intellectual property of the Company
material to its business.

its fair market value as determined in good faith by the Board on the date such determination is
made.

$59892 v7/SD 7.
5. CONVERSION RIGHTS.

The holders of the Series Preferred shall have the following rights with
respect to the conversion of the Series Preferred into shares of Common Stock (the “Conversion
Rights"):

{a) Optional Conversion. Subject to and in compliance with the
provisions of this Section 5, any shares of Series Preferred may, at the option of the holder, be
converted at any time into fully-paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock. The number
of shares of Common Stock to which a holder of Series Preferred shall be entitled upon
conversion shall be the product obtained by multiplying the applicable “Series Preferred
Conversion Rate” then in effect (determined as provided in Section 5(b)) by the number of shares
of Series Preferred being converted.

(b) Series Preferred Conversion Rate, The conversion rate in effect
at any time for the conversion of the Series Preferred (the “Series Preferred Conversion Rate”)
shall be the quotient obtained by dividing the applicable Original Issue Price of the Series
Preferred by the applicable “Series Preferred Conversion Price,” calculated as provided in
Section 5(c).

(c) Series Preferred Conversion Price. The conversion price for the
Series A Preferred shall initially be the Original Issue Price of the Series A Preferred and the
conversion price of the Series B Preferred shall initially be the Original Issue Price of the Series
B Preferred (each such conversion price, the “Series Preferred Conversion Price”). Such initial
Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be adjusted from time to time in accordance with this
Section 5. All references to the Series Preferred Conversion Price herein shall mean the Series
Preferred Conversion Price as so adjusted.

(d) Mechanics of Conversion. Each holder of Series Preferred who
desires to convert the same into shares of Common Stock pursuant to this Section 5 shall
surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Company or
any transfer agent for the Series Preferred, and shall give written notice to the Company at such
office that such holder elects to convert the same. Such notice shall state the number of shares of
Series Preferred being converted. Thereupon, the Company shall promptly issue and deliver at
such office to such holder a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock
to which such holder is entitled and shall promptly pay (i) in cash or, to the extent sufficient
funds are not then legally available therefor, in Common Stock (at the Common Stock’s fair
market value determined by the Board as of the date of such conversion), any declared and
unpaid dividends on the shares of Series Preferred being converted and (ii) in cash (at the
Common Stock’s fair market value determined by the Board as of the date of conversion) the
value of any fractional share of Common Stock otherwise issuable to any holder of Series
Preferred. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made at the close of business on the
date of such surrender of the certificates representing the shares of Series Preferred to be
converted, and the person entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such
conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such shares of Common Stock
on such date.

$59892 v7/SD 8.
(e) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If at any time
or from time to time on or after the date that the first share of Series B Preferred is issued (the
“Original Issue Date”) the Company effects a subdivision of the outstanding Common Stock
without a corresponding subdivision of the Series Preferred, the Series Preferred Conversion
Price for such series in effect immediately before that subdivision shall be proportionately
decreased. Conversely, if at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date the
Company combines the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares
without a corresponding combination of the Series Preferred, the Series Preferred Conversion
Price for such series in effect immediately before the combination shall be proportionately
increased. Any adjustment under this Section 5(e) shall become effective at the close of business
on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective.

(f) Adjustment for Common Stock Dividends and Distributions.
If at any time or from time to time on or after the Original Issue Date the Company pays to
holders of Common Stock a dividend or other distribution in additional shares of Common Stock
without a corresponding dividend or other distribution to holders of Preferred Stock, the Scries
Preferred Conversion Price for such series then in effect shall be decreased as of the time of such
issuance, as provided below:

(i) The Series Preferred Conversion Price for such series shall
be adjusted by multiplying the Series Preferred Conversion Price for such series then in effect by
a fraction equal to:

(A) _ the numerator of which is the total number of shares
of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance, and

(B) the denominator of which is the total number of
shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance
plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or
distribution;

(ii) If the Company fixes a record date to determine which
holders ‘of Common Stock are entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution, the Series
Preferred Conversion Price for each series of Series Preferred shall be fixed as of the close of
business on such record date and the number of shares of Common Stock shall be calculated
immediately prior to the close of business on such record date; and

(iii) If such record date is fixed and such dividend is not fully
paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the Series Preferred
Conversion Price for each series of Series Preferred shall be recomputed accordingly as of the
close of business on such record date and thereafter the Series Preferred Conversion Price for
each series of Series Preferred shall be adjusted pursuant to this Section 5(f) to reflect the actual
payment of such dividend or distribution.

(g) Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange, Substitution,
Reorganization, Merger or Consolidation. If at any time on or after the Original Issue Date

§59892 v7/SD 9.
the Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of a series of the Series Preferred is changed
into the same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by
recapitalization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or otherwise (other than an Acquisition or
Asset Transfer as defined in Section 4 or a subdivision or combination of shares or stock
dividend provided for elsewhere in this Section 5), in any such event each holder of such series
of Series Preferred shall then have the right to convert such stock into the kind and amount of
stock and other securities and property receivable upon such recapitalization, reclassification,
merger, consolidation or other change by holders of the maximum number of shares of Common
Stock into which such shares of Series Preferred could have been converted immediately prior to
such recapitalization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or change, all subject to further
adjustment as provided herein or with respect to such other securities or property by the terms
thereof. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the
provisions of this Section 5 with respect to the rights of the holders of such series of Series
Preferred after the capital reorganization to the end that the provisions of this Section 5
(including adjustment of the Series Preferred Conversion Price for such series of Series Preferred
then in effect and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of such series of Series
Preferred) shall be applicable after that event and be as nearly equivalent as practicable.

(h) —_ Sale of Shares Below Series Preferred Conversion Price.

(i) Series B Preferred on or prior to a Qualified Financing.
If at any time or from time to time on or prior to the closing of a financing that is not led or
priced by stockholders or corporate strategic investors of the Company existing immediately
prior to such closing and in which (i) the gross cash proceeds to the Company (before any
discounts, commissions and fees) are at least $15,000,000, (ii) at least $7,500,000 is raised from
investors that are not, and are not affiliated with, securityholders of the Company immediately
prior to such closing and (iii) any adjustment of the Series Preferred Conversion Price of the
Series B Preferred pursuant to this Section S(h) is not waived (a “Qualified Financing”), the
Company issues or sells, or is deemed by the express provisions of this Section 5(h) to have
issued or sold, Additiona) Shares of Common Stock (as defined below) other than as provided in
Sections 5(e), 5(f) or 5(g) above or in connection with an Unauthorized Option Pool Increase (as
defined below), for an Effective Price (as defined below) less than the then effective Series
Preferred Conversion Price for the Series B Preferred (a “Qualifying Dilutive Issuance”), then
and in each such case, the then existing Series Preferred Conversion Price for the Series B
Preferred shall be reduced, as of the opening of business on the date of such issue or sale, to a
price equal to such Effective Price.

(ii) Series B Preferred after a Qualified Financing or Series
A Preferred. If at any time or from time to time: (i) solely with respect to the Series B Preferred,
either (x) in connection with an Unauthorized Option Pool Increase prior to the earlier of a
Qualified Financing or a Non-Dilutive Financing (as defined below) or (y) after a Qualified
Financing; or (ii) solely with respect to the Series A Preferred, after the Original issue Date, the
Company issues or sells, or is deemed by the express provisions of this Section 5(h) to have
issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock, other than as provided in Section 5(e), 5(f)
or 5(y) above, for an Effective Price less than the then effective Series Preferred Conversion
Price for a series of Series Preferred (also a “Qualifying Dilutive Issuance”), then and in each

559892 v7/SD 10.
such case, the then existing Series Preferred Conversion Price for such scries of Series Preferred
shall be reduced, as of the opening of business on the date of such issue or sale, to a price
determined by multiplying the Series Preferred Conversion Price for such series in effect
immediately prior to such issuance or sale by a fraction equal to:

(A) the numerator of which shall be (A) the number of
shares of Common Stock deemed outstanding (as determined below) immediately prior to such
issue or sale, plus (B) the number of shares of Common Stock which the Aggregate
Consideration (as defined below) received or deemed received by the Company for the total
number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued would purchase at such then-existing
Series Preferred Conversion Price, and

(B) the denominator of which shall be the number of
shares of Common Stock deemed outstanding (as determined below) immediately prior to such
issue or Sale plus the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued.

For the purposes of the preceding sentence, the number of shares of Common Stock
deemed to be outstanding as of a given date shall be the sum of (A) the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding, (B) the number of shares of Common Stock into which the then
outstanding shares of Series Preferred could be converted if fully converted on the day
immediately preceding the given date and (C) the number of shares of Common Stock which are
issuable upon the exercise or conversion of all other rights, options and convertible securities
outstanding on the day immediately preceding the given date.

(iii) No adjustment shall be made to the Series Preferred
Conversion Price for any series of Series Preferred in an amount less than $0.01 per share. Any
adjustment required by this Section 5(h) shall be rounded to the nearest $0.01 per share, Any
adjustment otherwise required by this Section 5(h) that is not required to be made due to the
preceding two sentences shall be included in any subsequent adjustment to the Series Preferred
Conversion Price for such series of Series Preferred.

(iv) For the purpose of making any adjustment required under
this Section 5(h), the aggregate consideration received by the Company for any issue or sale of
securities (the “Aggregate Consideration”) shall be defined as: (A) to the extent it consists of
cash, be computed at the gross amount of cash received by the Company before deduction of any
underwriting or similar commissions, compensation or concessions paid or allowed by the
Company in connection with such issue or sale and without deduction of any expenses payable
by the Company, (B) to the extent it consists of property other than cash, be computed at the fair
value of that property as determined in good faith by the Board, and (C) if Additional Shares of
Common Stock, Convertible Securities (as defined below) or rights or options to purchase either
Additional Shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities are issued or sold together with
other stock or securities or other assets of the Company for a consideration which covers both, be
computed as the portion of the consideration so received that may be reasonably determined in
good faith by the Board to be allocable to such Additional Shares of Common Stock, Convertible
Securities or rights or options.

559892 v7/SD iH.
(v) For the purpose of the adjustment required under this
Section 5(h), if the Company issues or sells (x) Preferred Stock or other stock, options, warrants,
purchase rights or other securities convertible into, Additional Shares of Common Stock (such
convertible stock or securities being herein referred to as “Convertible Securities”) or (y) rights
or options for the purchase of Additional Shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities and
if the Effective Price of such Additional Shares of Common Stock is Iess than the Series
Preferred Conversion Price for any series of Series Preferred, in each case the Company shall be
deemed to have issued at the time of the issuance of such rights or options or Convertible
Securities the maximum number of Additional Shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise
or conversion thereof and to have received as consideration for the issuance of such shares an
amount equal to the total amount of the consideration, if any, received by the Company for the
issuance of such rights or options or Convertible Securities plus:

(A) _ in the case of such rights or options, the minimum
amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon the exercise of such rights or
options; and

(B) _ in the case of Convertible Securities, the minimum
amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon the conversion thereof (other
than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities);
provided that if the minimum amounts of such consideration cannot be ascertained, but are a
function of antidilution or similar protective clauses, the Company shall be deemed to have
received the minimum amounts of consideration without reference to such clauses.

(C) If the minimum amount of consideration payable to
the Company upon the exercise or conversion of rights, options or Convertible Securities is
reduced over time or on the occurrence or non-occurrence of specified events other than by
reason of antidilution adjustments, the Effective Price shall be recalculated using the figure to
which such minimum amount of consideration is reduced; provided further, that if the minimum
amount of consideration payable to the Company upon the exercise or conversion of such rights,
options or Convertible Securities is subsequently increased, the Effective Price shall be again
recalculated using the increased minimum amount of consideration payable to the Company upon
the exercise or conversion of such rights, options or Convertible Securities.

(@) No further adjustment of the Series Preferred
Conversion Price for a series of Series Preferred, as adjusted upon the issuance of such rights,
options or Convertible Securities, shall be made as a result of the actual issuance of Additional
Shares of Common Stock or the exercise of any such rights or options or the conversion of any
such Convertible Securities. If any such rights or options or the conversion privilege represented
by any such Convertible Securities shall expire without having been exercised, the Series
Preferred Conversion Price for such series as adjusted upon the issuance of such rights, options
or Convertible Securities shall be readjusted to the Series Preferred Conversion Price for such
series which would have been in effect had an adjustment been made on the basis that the only
Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued were the Additional Shares of Common Stock, if
any, actually issued or sold on the exercise of such rights or options or rights of conversion of
such Convertible Securities, and such Additional Shares of Common Stock, if any, were issued

559892 v7/SD 12.
or sold for the consideration actually received by the Company upon such exercise, plus the
consideration, if any, actually received by the Company for the granting of all such rights or
options, whether or not exercised, plus the consideration received for issuing or selling the
Convertible Securities actually converted, plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the
Company (other than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible
Securities) on the conversion of such Convertible Securities, provided that such readjustment
shall not apply to prior conversions of Series Preferred.

(vi) For the purpose of making any adjustment to the
Conversion Price of the Series Preferred required under this Section 5(h), “Additional Shares of
Common Stock” shall mean all shares of Common Stock issued by the Company or deemed to
be issued pursuant to this Section 5(h) (including shares of Common Stock subsequently
reacquired or retired by the Company), other than:

(A) shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of
the Series Preferred; provided that such Series Preferred was initially issued at a price no less
than the Original Issuance Price applicable to such Series Preferred;

(B) _ shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities
issued after the Original Issue Date to employees, officers or directors of, or consultants or
advisors to, the Company or any subsidiary pursuant to stock purchase or stock option plans or
other arrangements that are approved by the Board; provided, however, that prior to the earlier of
a Qualified Financing or a Non-Dilutive Financing, the exception from the definition of
Additional Shares of Common Stock provided under this subsection B shall not exceed up to an
aggregate of 1,677,752 shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities (as adjusted for any
stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like after the filing date hereof,
and excluding any shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities that are approved by at
least two of the three Series B Directors and are intended to be or in fact are issued or issuable
solely to employees, officers or directors of, or consultants or advisors to, the Company that, as
of the filing date hereof, (A) are not employed or engaged by the Company and (B) do not hold
any Common Stock or securities of the Company pursuant to which Common Stock is issuable);
provided further, however, that such amount shall be increased to reflect any shares of Common
Stock (i) not issued pursuant to the rights, agreements, options or warrants previously counted
against such amount (“Unexercised Options”) as a result of the termination of such Unexercised
Options and (ii) reacquired by the Company from employees, directors or consultants at cost (or
the lesser of cost or fair market value) pursuant to agreements which permit the Company to
repurchase such shares upon termination of services to the Company;

(C) shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to the
exercise of Convertible Securities outstanding as of the Original Issue Date;

(D) _ shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities
issued for consideration other than cash pursuant to a merger, consolidation, acquisition, strategic
alliance or similar business combination; provided that the issuance of shares therein has been
approved by the Board;

559892 v7/SD 13.
(E) shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities
issued pursuant to any equipment loan or leasing arrangement, real property leasing arrangement
or debt financing from a bank or similar financial institution; provided that the issuance of shares
therein has been approved by the Board;

(F) shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities
issued to third-party service providers in exchange for or as partial consideration for services
rendered to the Company; provided that the issuance of shares therein has been approved by the
Board; and

(G) any Common Stock or Convertible Securities issued
in connection with strategic transactions involying the Company and other entities, including,
without limitation, (i) joint ventures, manufacturing, marketing or distribution arrangements or
(ii) technology transfer or development arrangements; provided that the issuance of shares
therein has been approved by the Board;

provided, however, that the total number of shares excluded from the definition of Additional
Shares of Common Stock pursuant to subsections (d), (e), (f) and (g) above shall not exceed
3,000,000 shares in the aggregate (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits,
recapitalizations and the like with respect to such shares after the filing date hereof).

References to Common Stock in the subsections of this clause (vi) above shall
mean all shares of Common Stock issued by the Company or deemed to be issued pursuant to
this Section 5(h). The “Effective Price” of Additional Shares of Common Stock shall mean the
quotient determined by dividing the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock issued
or sold, or deemed to have been issued or sold by the Company under this Section 5(h), into the
Aggregate Consideration received, or deemed to have been received by the Company for such
issue under this Section 5(h), for such Additional Shares of Common Stock. In the event that the
number of shares of Additional Shares of Common Stock or the Effective Price cannot be
ascertained at the time of issuance (other than by virtue of antidilution provisions contained
therein that have not yet been invoked), such Additional Shares of Common Stock shall be
deemed issued immediately upon the occurrence of the first event that makes such number of
shares or the Effective Price, as applicable, ascertainable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
case of an Unauthorized Option Pool Increase for which an adjustment under this Section 5(h) is
required, for the purposes of such adjustment, all shares issued or reserved for issuance in
connection with such Unauthorized Option Pool Increase shall be deemed to be outstanding and
issued at the fair market value of the Common Stock at the time of such Unauthorized Option
Pool Increase, as reasonably determined by the Board acting in good faith, including at least two
of the three Series B Directors. For the purposes hereof, “Non-Dilutive Financing” shall mean
the receipt by the Company in a financing of gross cash proceeds of at least $15,000,000 by .
means other than the contingent or actual incurrence of a debt obligation (provided that
forgiveness of indebtedness shal] be deemed a Non-Dilutive Financing) or the issuance of equity
securities (except with respect to the portion of the issuance price thereof that is in excess of the
fair market value for such securities as reasonably determined by the Board acting in good faith,
including at least two of the three Series B Directors). For the purposes hereof, “Unauthorized
Option Pool Increase” shall mean any increase after the Original Issue Date in the number of

$59892 v7/SD 14,
shares reserved for issuance to employees, officers or directors of, or consultants or advisors to,

the Company or any subsidiary pursuant to stock purchase or stock option plans or other
arrangements.

(vii) In the event that the Company issues or sells, or is deemed
to have issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock in a Qualifying Dilutive Issuance
(the “First Dilutive Issuance”), then in the event that the Company issues or sells, or is deemed
to have issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock in a Qualifying Dilutive Issuance
other than the First Dilutive Issuance as a part of the same transaction or series of related
transactions as the First Dilutive Issuance (a “Subsequent Dilutive Issuance”), then and in each
such case upon a Subsequent Dilutive Issuance the Conversion Price shall be reduced to the
Conversion Price that would have been in effect had the First Dilutive Issuance and each
Subsequent Dilutive Issuance all occurred on the closing date of the First Dilutive Issuance.
Qualifying Dilutive Issuances occurring within three months of each other shall be deemed to be
part of the same transaction for the purposes of this subsection (vii).

(i) Certificate of Adjustment. In each case of an adjustment or
readjustment of the Series Preferred Conversion Price for the number of shares of Common
Stock or other securities issuable upon conversion of the Series Preferred, if such series of Series
Preferred is then convertible pursuant to this Section 5, the Company, at its expense, shall
compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the provisions hereof and shall,
upon request, prepare a certificate showing such adjustment or readjustment, and shall mail such
certificate, by first class mail, postage prepaid, to each registered holder of such Series Preferred
sO requesting at the holder’s address as shown in the Company’s books. The certificate shall set
forth such adjustment or readjustment, showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or
readjustment is based, including a statement of (i) the consideration received or deemed to be
received by the Company for any Additional Shares of Common Stock issued or sold or deemed
to have been issued or sold, (ii) the Series Preferred Conversion Price for such series at the time
in effect, (iii) the number of Additional Shares of Common Stock and (iv) the type and amount,
if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon conversion of such series of
Series Preferred. Failure to request or provide such notice shall have no effect on any such
adjustment.

Gj) Notices of Record Date. Upon (i) any taking by the Company of a
record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof
who are entitled to receive any dividend or other distribution, or (ii) any Acquisition (as defined
in Section4) or other capital reorganization of the Company, any reclassification or
recapitalization of the capital stock of the Company, any merger or consolidation of the Company
with or into any other corporation, or any Asset Transfer (as defined in Section 4), or any
voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company, the Company
shall mail to each holder of Series Preferred at least 10 days prior to (a) the record date, if any,
specified therein; or (b) if no record date is specified, the date upon which such action is to take
effect (or, in either case, such shorter period approved by the holders of a majority of the
outstanding Series Preferred) a notice specifying (A) the date on which any such record is to be
taken for the purpose of such dividend or distribution and a description of such dividend or
distribution, (B) the date on which any such Acquisition, reorganization, reclassification,

559892 v7/SD 15.
transfer, consolidation, merger, Asset Transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected
to become effective, and (C) the date, if any, that is to be fixed as to when the holders of record
of Common Stock (or other securities) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common
Stock (or other securities) for securities or other property deliverable upon such Acquisition,
reorganization, reclassification, transfer, consolidation, merger, Asset Transfer, dissolution,
liquidation or winding up.

(k) Automatic Conversion.

{i) Each share of Series Preferred shall automatically be
converted into shares of Common Stock, based on the then-effective Series Preferred Conversion
Price for the applicable series, (A) at any time upon the affirmative election of the holders of at
least a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series Preferred, voting together as a single class
on an as-if-converted basis, or (B) immediately upon the closing of a firmly underwritten public
offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, covering the offer and sale of Common Stock for the account of the Company in which
(i) the per share price is at least two and one half times the Original Issue Price of the Series B
Preferred, (as adjusted for stock splits, dividends, recapitalizations and the like after the filing
date hereof) and (ii) the gross cash proceeds to the Company (before underwriting discounts,
commissions and fees) are at least $30,000,000 (a “Qualified IPO”). Upon such automatic
conversion, any declared and unpaid dividends shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of
Section 5(d).

(ii) | Upon the occurrence of either of the events specified in
Section 5(k)(i) above, the outstanding shares of Series Preferred shall be converted automatically
without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates
representing such shares are surrendered to the Company or its transfer agent; provided, however,
that the Company shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common
Stock issuable upon such conversion unless the certificates evidencing such shares of Series
Preferred are either delivered to the Company or its transfer agent as provided below, or the
holder notifies the Company or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or
destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Company to indemnify the Company
from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates. Upon the occurrence of such
automatic conversion of the Series Preferred, the holders of Series Preferred shall surrender the
certificates representing such shares at the office of the Company or any transfer agent for the
Series Preferred. Thereupon, there shall be issued and delivered to such holder promptly at such
office and in its name as shown on such surrendered certificate or certificates, a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Series Preferred
surrendered were convertible on the date on which such automatic conversion occurred, and any
declared and unpaid dividends shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of Section 5(d).

@ Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall
be issued upon conversion of Series Preferred. Al) shares of Common Stock (including fractions
thereof) issuable upon conversion of more than one share of Series Preferred by a holder thereof
shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the conversion would result in the
issuance of any fractional share. If, after the aforementioned aggregation, the conversion would

$§9892 v7/SD 16.
result in the issuance of any fractional share, the Company shall, in lieu of issuing any fractional
share, pay cash equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by the fair market value of one
share of Common Stock (as determined by the Board) on the date of conversion.

(m) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Company
shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common
Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Series Preferred,
such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding shares of the Series Preferred. If at any time the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all then outstanding shares of the Series Preferred, the Company will take such corporate
action as may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to
such number of shares as shal! be sufficient for such purpose.

(n) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Section 5
shall be in writing and shall be deemed effectively given: (i) upon personal delivery to the party
to be notified, (ii) when sent by confirmed electronic mail or facsimile if sent during normal
business hours of the recipient; if not, then on the next business day, (iii) five days after having
been sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid or (iv) one day
after deposit with a nationally recognized overnight courier, specifying next day delivery, with
verification of receipt. All notices shall be addressed to each holder of record at the address of
such holder appearing on the books of the Company.

(0) Payment of Taxes. The Company will pay all taxes (other than
taxes based upon income) and other governmental charges that may be imposed with respect to
the issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of shares of Series Preferred,
excluding any tax or other charge imposed in connection with any transfer involved in the issue
and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in which the shares of Series
Preferred so converted were registered.

6. No REISSUANCE OF SERIES PREFERRED.

No shares or shares of Series Preferred acquired by the Company by reason of
redemption, purchase, conversion or otherwise shall be reissued.

V.

A. To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL as the same exists or as may
hereafter be amended, a director of the Company shall not be personally liable to the Company or
its stockholders for monetary damages for a breach of fiduciary duty as a director.

B. The Company may indemnify to the fullest extent permitted by law any person
made or threatened to be made a party to an action or proceeding, whether criminal, civil,
administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he, his testator or intestate is or was a
director, officer or employee of the Company or any predecessor of the Company or serves or

$59892 v7/SD 17.
served at any other enterprise as a director, officer or employee at the request of the Company or
any predecessor to the Company.

Cc. The Company is authorized to provide indemnification of agents (as defined in
Section 317 of the CGCL) for breach of duty to the Company and its stockholders through bylaw
provisions or through agreements with the agents, or through stockholder resolutions, or
otherwise, in excess of the indemnification otherwise permitted by Section 317 of the CGCL,
subject, at any time or times that the Company is subject to Section 2115(b) of the CGCL, to the
limits on such excess indemnification set forth in Section 204 of the CGCL.

D. Any repeal or modification of this Article V shall only be prospective and shall
not affect the rights under this Article V in effect at the time of the alleged occurrence of any
action or omission to act giving rise to liability.

E. In the event that a member of the Board who is also a partner or employee of an
entity that is a holder of Preferred Stock and that is in the business of investing and reinvesting in
other entities, or an employee of an entity that manages such an entity (each, a “Funtd”) acquires
knowledge of a potential transaction or other matter in such individual's capacity as a partner or
employee of the Fund or the manager or general partner of the Fund (and other than directly in
connection with such individual’s service as a member of the Board) and that may be an
opportunity of interest for both the Company and such Fund (a “Corporate Opportunity’), then
the Company (i) renounces any expectancy that such director or Fund offer an opportunity to
participate in such Corporate Opportunity to the Company and (ii) to the fullest extent permitted
by law, waives any claim that such opportunity constituted a Corporate Opportunity that should
have been presented by such director or Fund to the Company or any of its affiliates; provided,
however, that such director acts in good faith.

Vi.

For the management of the business and for the conduct of the affairs of the Company,
and in further definition, limitation and regulation of the powers of the Company, of its directors
and of its stockholders or any class thereof, as the case may be, it is further provided that:

A. The management of the business and the conduct of the affairs of the Company
shall be vested in its Board. The number of directors which shal] constitute the whole Board
shall be fixed by the Board in the manner provided in the Bylaws, subject to any restrictions
which may be set forth in this Restated Certificate.

B. The Board is expressly empowered to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the
Company. The stockholders shall also have the power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of
the Company; provided however, that, in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or serics
of stock of the Company required by law or by this Certificate of Incorporation, the affirmative
vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares
of the capital stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting
together as a single class, shall be required to adopt, amend or repeal any provision of the Bylaws
of the Company.
