2. Dividend Rights.

2.1 Preferred Stock. In each calendar year, the holders of the then-outstanding
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board, out of any funds and
assets of the Corporation legally available therefor, noncumulative dividends at the annual Dividend Rate
for each such series of Preferred Stock, prior and in preference to the payment of any dividends on the
Common Stock in such calendar year (other than a Common Stock Dividend). No dividends (other than a
Common Stock Dividend) shall be paid with respect to the Common Stock during any calendar year
unless dividends in the total amount of the annual Dividend Rate for each such series of Preferred Stock
shall have first been paid or declared and set apart for payment to the holders of each such series of
Preferred Stock, respectively, during that calendar year; provided, however, that this restriction shall not
apply to Permitted Repurchases. Payments of any dividends to the holders of each such series of
Preferred Stock shall be paid pro rata, on an equal priority, pari passu basis according to their respective
Dividend Rates as set forth herein. Dividends on the Preferred Stock shall not be mandatory or
cumulative, and no rights or interest shall accrue to the holders of the Preferred Stock by reason of the
fact that the Corporation shall fail to declare or pay dividends on the Preferred Stock in the amount of the
respective annual Dividend Rate for each such series or in any other amount in any calendar year or any
fiscal year of the Corporation, whether or not the earnings of the Corporation in any calendar year or
fiscal year were sufficient to pay such dividends in whole or in part.

2.2 Participation Rights. If, after dividends in the full preferential amounts specified
in subsection 2.1 for the Preferred Stock have been paid or declared and set apart in any calendar year of
the Corporation, the Board shall declare additional dividends out of funds legally available therefor in that
calendar year, then such additional dividends shall be declared pro rata on the Common Stock and the
Preferred Stock on a pari passu basis according to the number of shares of Common Stock held by such
holders, where each holder of shares of Preferred Stock is to be treated for this purpose as holding the
greatest whole number of shares of Common Stock then issuable upon conversion of all shares of
Preferred Stock held by such holder pursuant to Section 5.

2.3 Non-Cash Dividends. Whenever a dividend provided for in this Section 2 shall
be payable in property other than cash, the value of such dividend shall be determined as set forth in
Section 3.4 below.

3. Liquidation Rights. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, the funds and assets of the Corporation that may be
legally distributed to the Corporation’s stockholders (the “Available Funds and Assets”) shall be
distributed to stockholders in the following manner:

3,1 Preferred Stock. The holders of each share of Preferred Stock then outstanding
shall be entitled to be paid, out of the Available Funds and Assets, and prior and in preference to any
payment or distribution (or any setting apart of any payment or distribution) of any Available Funds and
Assets on any shares of Common Stock, an amount per share equal to the Original Issue Price for each
such series of Preferred Stock, respectively, plus all declared but unpaid dividends thereon. If upon any
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the Available Funds and Assets shall be
insufficient to permit the payment to holders of the Preferred Stock of their full preferential amounts
described ‘in this subsection, then all of the Available Funds and Assets shall be distributed among the
holders of the then-outstanding Preferred Stock pro rata, on an equal priority, pari passu basis,
proportionately according to their respective liquidation preferences as set forth herein.

3.2 Series D Participation Rights. If there are any Available Funds and Assets
remaining after the payment or distribution (or the setting aside for payment or distribution) to the holders
of the Preferred Stock of their full preferential amounts described above in subsection 3.1, then all such
remaining Available Funds and Assets shall be distributed among the holders of the then-outstanding

2 22628/00013/SF/5210465.4
Common Stock and the Series D Preferred Stock pro rata according to the number of shares of Common
Stock held by such holders, where, for this purpose, holders of shares of Series D Preferred Stock will be
deemed to hold the greatest whole number of shares of Common Stock then issuable upon conversion in
full of such shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 5 until such time as each holder of then-
outstanding Series D Preferred Stock shall have received, in distributions made under subsection 3.1 and
this subsection 3.2, an aggregate amount equal to three times the Original Issue Price for each share of
Series D Preferred Stock held by each such holder (such amount in the aggregate the “Series D
Participation Cap”). If there are any Available Funds and Assets remaining after the holders of the
Series D Preferred Stock have received an amount equal to the Series D Participation Cap, then all such
remaining Available Funds and Assets shall be distributed among the holders of then-outstanding
Common Stock pro rata according to the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock then held by
each of them.

3.3 Merger or Sale of Assets. Any (i) consolidation, merger or similar transaction of
the Corporation with or into any other corporation or corporations or other entity or entities in which the
holders of the Corporation’s outstanding shares immediately before such consolidation, merger or similar
transaction do not immediately after such consolidation, merger or similar transaction retain stock, or
other corresponding ownership interest, representing a majority of the voting power of the surviving
corporation, or other entity, of such consolidation, merger or similar transaction, or the parent corporation
of such surviving corporation or entity, as a result of their shareholdings in the Corporation immediately
prior to the consolidation, merger or similar transaction or (ii) sale, transfer or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, shall be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation as those terms are used in this Section 3.

3.4 Non-Cash Consideration, If any Available Funds and Assets of the Corporation
distributed to stockholders in connection with any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the
Corporation are other than cash, then the value of such assets shall be their fair market value as mutually
determined by the Board and the holders of a majority of the Preferred Stock then outstanding, except that
any securities to be distributed to stockholders in a liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the
Corporation shall be valued as follows:

(a) The method of valuation of securities not subject to investment letter or
other similar restrictions on free marketability shall be as follows:

(i) if the securities are then traded on a national securities exchange
or the Nasdaq National Market (or a similar national quotation system), then the value shall be deemed to
be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange or system over the 30-day period
ending 3 days prior to the distribution;

(ii) if actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be deemed to
be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the 30-day period ending 3
days prior to the distribution; and

(iii) if there is no active public market, then the value shall be the fair
market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board of the Corporation and the holders of a
majority of the Preferred Stock then outstanding.

(b) The method of valuation of securities subject to investment letter or other
restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of a stockholder’s status
as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount from the market value
determined as above in subparagraphs (a)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this subsection to reflect the approximate fair
market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board.

AASCAOINANADIOTIESANALE A
(c) Notwithstanding the above, for purposes of determining the amount each
holder of shares of Preferred Stock is entitled to receive with respect to a liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation, each such holder of shares of a series of Preferred Stock shall be deemed
to have converted (regardless of whether such holder actually converted) such holder’s shares of such
series into shares of Common Stock immediately prior to the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation if, as a result of an actual conversion, such holder would receive, in the aggregate, an amount
greater than the amount that would be distributed to such holder if such holder did not convert such series
of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock. If any such holder shall be deemed to have converted
shares of Preferred Stock into Common Stock pursuant to this paragraph, then such holder shall not be
entitled to receive any distribution that would otherwise be made to holders of Preferred Stock that have
not converted (or have not been deemed to have converted) into shares of Common Stock.

4, Voting Rights,

4.1 Common Stock. Each holder of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to one
(1) vote for each share thereof held. The number of authorized shares of Common Stock may be

5. Conversion Rights, The outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be convertible into
- Common Stock as follows:

2 AASADINARADIATUISNANALE A
5.1 Optional Conversion.

(a) At the option of the holder thereof, each share of Preferred Stock shall be
convertible into fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as provided herein.

(b) Each holder of Preferred Stock who elects to convert the same into
shares of Common Stock shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office
of the Corporation or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock or Common Stock, and shall give written
notice to the Corporation at such office that such holder elects to convert the same and shall state therein
the number of shares of Preferred Stock being converted. Thereupon the Corporation shall promptly issue
and deliver at such office to such holder a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common
Stock to which such holder is entitled upon such conversion. Such conversion shall be deemed to have
been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the certificate or
certificates representing the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person entitled to receive
the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record
holder of such shares of Common Stock on such date. If a conversion election under this subsection 5.1
is made in connection with an underwritten offering of the Corporation’s securities pursuant to the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (which underwritten offering does not cause an automatic conversion
pursuant to subsection 5.2 to take place) the conversion may, at the option of the holder tendering shares
of Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of the
Corporation’s securities pursuant to such offering, in which event the holders making such elections who
are entitled to receive Common Stock upon conversion of their Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to
have converted such shares of Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of the
Corporation’s securities in the offering,

5.2 Automatic Conversion.

(a) Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into fully
paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock, as provided herein, immediately prior to the closing of
a Qualified IPO. In addition, prior to the closing of a Qualified IPO, each share of Preferred Stock shall
automatically be converted into fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock, as provided
herein, upon the Corporation’s receipt of the written consent of the holders of not less than two thirds
(2/3) of the then-outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class and on an as
converted basis, to the conversion of all then-outstanding Preferred Stock under this Section 5.

(b) Upon the occurrence of an event specified in subparagraph 5.2(a) above,
the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted into Common Stock automatically without
the need for any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates
representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent; provided, however, that
the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion unless the certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are either
delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent as provided below, or the holder notifies the Corporation
or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement
reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in
connection with such certificates. Upon the occurrence of such automatic conversion of the Preferred
Stock, the holders of Preferred Stock shall surrender the certificates representing such shares at the office
of the Corporation or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock or Common Stock. Thereupon, there
shall be issued and delivered to such holder promptly at such office and in such holder’s name as shown
on such surrendered certificate or certificates, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of
Common Stock into which the shares of Preferred Stock surrendered were convertible on the date on
which such automatic conversion occurred.
5.3 Conversion Price. Each share of outstanding Preferred Stock shall be convertible
in accordance with subsection 5.1 or subsection 5.2 above into the number of fully paid and nonassessable
shares of Common Stock that results from dividing the Original Issue Price of such series of Preferred
Stock by the conversion price for such series of Preferred Stock that is in effect at the time of conversion
(the “Conversion Price”), The initial Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock shall be the
Original Issue Price for each such series of Preferred Stock, and shall be subject to adjustment from time
to time as provided below.: Following each adjustment of the Conversion Price, such adjusted Conversion
Price shall remain in effect until a further adjustment of such Conversion Price hereunder.

5.4 Adjustment Upon Common Stock Event. Upon the happening of a Common
Stock Event (as hereinafter defined), the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock shall,
simultaneously with the happening of such Common Stock Event, be adjusted by multiplying the
Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such Common Stock
Event by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to such Common Stock Event, and (ii) the denominator of which shall
be the number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately after such Common Stock
Event, and the product so obtained shall thereafter be the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred
Stock. The Conversion Price for a series of Preferred Stock shall be readjusted in the same manner upon
the happening of each subsequent Common Stock Event. As used herein, the term the “Common Stock
Evenf’ shall mean at any time or from time to time after the Effective Date, (i) the issue by the
Corporation of a Common Stock Dividend, (ii) a subdivision or split of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, or (iii) a combination of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock.

5.5 Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. If at any time or from time
to time after the Effective Date, the Corporation pays a dividend or makes another distribution to the
holders of the Common Stock payable in securities of the Corporation or otherwise, other than an event
constituting a Common Stock Event or pursuant to Section 3 or elsewhere in this Section 5, then in each
such event provision shall be made so that the holders of each series of Preferred Stock shall receive upon
conversion thereof, in addition to the number of shares of Common Stock receivable upon conversion
thereof, the amount of securities of the Corporation or otherwise that they would have received had their
Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event (or such record date, as
applicable) and had they thereafter, during the period from the date of such event (or such record date, as
applicable) to and including the conversion date, retained such securities receivable by them as aforesaid
during such period, subject to all other adjustments called for during such period under this Section 5 with
respect to the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock or with respect to such other securities by their
terms.

5.6 Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. If at any time or
from time to time after the Effective Date, the Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of each series
of Preferred Stock is changed into the same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of
stock, whether by recapitalization, reclassification or otherwise (other than by a Common Stock Event or
a stock dividend, reorganization, merger, or consolidation provided for elsewhere in this Section 5 or in
Section 3), then in any such event each holder of Preferred Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert
such stock into the kind and amount of stock and other securities and property receivable upon such
recapitalization, reclassification or other change by holders of the number of shares of Common Stock
into which such shares of Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately prior to such
recapitalization, reclassification or change, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein or with
respect to such other securities or property by the terms thereof. In any such case, appropriate adjustment
shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 5 with respect to the rights of the holders
of the Preferred Stock after the reclassification, exchange or substitution to the end that the provisions of
this Section 5 (including adjustment of the Conversion Price then in effect and number of shares issuable
upon conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event and be as nearly equivalent to
the provisions hereof as may be practicable.

5.7 Reorganizations, Mergers and Consolidations. If at any time or from time to
time after the Effective Date, there is a reorganization of the Corporation (other than a recapitalization,
subdivision, combination, reclassification or exchange of shares provided for elsewhere in this Section 5)
or a merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into another corporation (except an event that is
governed under Section 3), then, as a part of such reorganization, merger or consolidation, provision shall
be made so that the holders of each series of Preferred Stock thereafter shall be entitled to receive, upon
conversion of such Preferred Stock, the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the
Corporation, or of such successor corporation resulting from such reorganization, merger or
consolidation, to which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of
Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately prior to such reorganization, merger or
consolidation deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled on such reorganization, merger or
consolidation. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions
of this Section 5 with respect to the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock after the reorganization,
merger or consolidation to the end that the provisions of this Section 5 (including adjustment of the
Conversion Price then in effect and number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock)
shall be applicable after that event and be as nearly equivalent to the provisions hereof as may be
practicable. This subsection 5.7 shall similarly apply to successive reorganizations, mergers and
consolidations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5, if any
reorganization, merger or consolidation is approved by the vote of stockholders required by Section 6
hereof, then such transaction and the rights of the holders of Preferred Stock and Common Stock pursuant
to such reorganization, merger or consolidation will be governed by the documents entered into in
connection with such transaction and not by the provisions of this Section 5.7.

5.8 Sale of Shares Below Conversion Price. )

(a) Adjustment Formula. If at any time or from time to time after the
Effective Date, the Corporation issues or sells, or is deemed by the provisions of this subsection 5.8 to
have issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock (as hereinafter defined), otherwise than in
connection with a Common Stock Event as provided in subsection 5.4, a dividend or distribution as
provided in subsection 5.5 or a recapitalization, reclassification or other change as provided in subsection
5.6, or a reorganization, merger or consolidation as provided in subsection 5.7, for an Effective Price (as
hereinafter defined) that is less than the Conversion Price for a series of Preferred Stock in effect
immediately prior to such issue or sale (or deemed issue or sale), then, and in each such case, the
Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock shall be reduced, as of the close of business on the
date of such issue or sale, to the price obtained by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction:

to any additional or similar protective or antidilution clauses) is less than the Conversion Price then in
effect for a series of Preferred Stock, then the Corporation shall be deemed to have issued, at the time of
the issuance of such Rights, Options or Convertible Securities, that number of Additional Shares of
Common Stock that is equal to the maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise
and/or conversion or exchange (assuming satisfaction of any conditions to exercisability or conversion or

Options or Convertible Securities, plus, in the case of such Rights or Options, the minimum amounts of
consideration, if any, payable to the Corporation upon the exercise in full of such Rights or Options, plus,
in the case of Convertible Securities, the minimum amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the
Corporation (other than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible
Securities) upon the conversion or exchange thereof; provided that:

(i) if the minimum amounts of such consideration cannot be
ascertained, but are a function of antidilution or similar protective clauses, then the Corporation shall be
deemed to have received the minimum amounts of consideration without reference to such clauses;

(ii) if the minimum amount of consideration payable to the
Corporation upon the exercise of Rights or Options or the conyersion or exchange of Convertible
Securities is reduced over time or upon the occurrence or non-occurrence of specified events other than
by reason of antidilution or similar protective adjustments, then the Effective Price shall be recalculated
using the figure to which such minimum amount of consideration is reduced; and

11 2OK7R/0NN 1 3/SF/5210465.4
(iii) if the minimum amount of consideration payable to the
Corporation upon the exercise of such Rights or Options or the conversion or exchange of Convertible
Securities is subsequently increased, then the Effective Price shall again be recalculated using the
increased minimum amount of consideration payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such Rights
or Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities (but such Effective Price shall
not result in a recalculation above the Conversion Price which would then be in effect for a series of
Preferred Stock if not for the adjustment made for such Rights or Options).

No further adjustment of the Conversion Price, adjusted upon the issuance of such Rights or Options or
Convertible Securities, shall be made as a result of the actual issuance of shares of Common Stock on the
exercise of any such Rights or Options or the conversion or exchange of any such Convertible Securities.
If any such Rights or Options or the conversion or exchange rights represented by any such Convertible
Securities shall expire without having been fully exercised, then the Conversion Price as adjusted upon
the issuance of such Rights or Options or Convertible Securities shall be readjusted to the Conversion
Price that would have been in effect had an adjustment been made on the basis that the only shares of
Common Stock so issued were the shares of Common Stock, if any, that were actually issued or sold on
the exercise of such Rights or Options or rights of conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities,
and such shares of Common Stock, if any, were issued or sold for the consideration actually received by
the Corporation upon such exercise, plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the Corporation
for the granting of all such Rights or Options, whether or not exercised, plus the consideration received
for issuing or selling all such Convertible Securities actually converted or exchanged, plus the
consideration, if any, actually received by the Corporation (other than by cancellation of liabilities or
obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities) on the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, provided that such readjustment shall not apply to prior conversions of Preferred Stock.

5.9 Certificate of Adjustment. In each case of an adjustment or readjustment of the
Conversion Price for a series of Preferred Stock, the Corporation, at its expense, shall cause its Chief
Financial Officer to compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the provisions hereof
and prepare a certificate showing such adjustment or readjustment, and shall mail such certificate, by first
class mail, postage prepaid, to each registered holder of the Preferred Stock at the holder’s address as
shown in the Corporation’s books.

5.10 Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon
any conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional share to which the holder would otherwise be
entitled, the Corporation shall pay the holder cash equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by the
Common Stock’s fair market value as determined in good faith by the Board as of the date of conversion.
Whether or not fractional shares would be issuable upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis
of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock the holder is at the time converting into Common Stock
and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion.

5.11 Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at all
times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock, solely for
the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock, such number of its shares of
Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares
of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock
shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then-outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, the
Corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase
its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for
such purpose. ,

5.12 Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Certificate of
Incorporation to be given to the holders of shares of the Preferred Stock shall be deemed given upon the
earlier of actual receipt or deposit in the United States mail, by certified or registered mail, return receipt

5.13. No Impairment. Without first obtaining such approvals as are required under
applicable law and Article V, Section 6 hereof, the Corporation shall not avoid or seek to avoid the
observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the
Corporation, but shall at all times in good faith assist in carrying out all such action as may be reasonably
necessary or appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock
against impairment.
