of stock) that they would have been entitled to receive had they converted their Series B-2
Preferred Stock into Common Stock immediately before such event.

number of shares of Common Stock determined by multiplying the number of outstanding shares
of Series C Preferred Stock to be converted by $90.32 and dividing the result by its then effective
conversion price (the “Series C Conversion Price”). The initial Series C Conversion Price shall
be $90.32. Such Series C Conversion Price shall be automatically adjusted upon any stock
dividend, stock split, combination, reorganization or other recapitalization so that the holders of

they would have been entitled to receive had they converted their Series C Preferred Stock into
Common Stock immediately before such event.

the number of shares of Common Stock determined by multiplying the number of outstanding
shares of Series C-1 Preferred Stock to be converted by $50.00 and dividing the result by its then

(iii) “Convertible Securities’ means any evidences of
indebtedness and all rights or options for the purchase of, or stock or other securities convertible
into, shares of Preferred Stock, Additional Shares of Common or other Convertible Securities,

(vi) If an adjustment has been made under this Section 2.4(1) as

exercise or conversion of the original Convertible Security.

(vii) Subject to Section 2.4(i)(i) above, if the purchase price
provided for in any Convertible Security, or the rate at which any Convertible Securities is
convertible shall change, or a different purchase price or rate under such provisions shall become
effective at any time or from time to time, then, upon the change becoming effective, the Series
C Conversion Price for each particular share of Series C Preferred Stock then in effect and the
Series C-1 Conversion Price for each particular share of Series C-! Preferred Stock then in effect
shall each forthwith be increased or decreased to the Series C Conversion Price or Series C-1
Conversion Price, as applicable, that would then be in effect had such Convertible Security
originally been issued with such changed terms (without affecting shares of Common Stock
already issued upon the conversion of any shares of Series C Preferred Stock or Series C-1
Preferred Stock already converted).

(viii) For purposes of the operation of Section 2.4(i), the
consideration received by the Corporation for any issue or sale of securities shall: (A) to the

Corporation, (B) to the extent it consists of property other than cash, be computed at the fair
value of that property as determined in good faith by the Board, and (C) to the extent Additional
Shares of Common or Convertible Securities are issued or sold together with other stock or

Certificate, the Corporation shall make a certificate signed by its Chief Financial Officer or

prepaid) to each holder of affected Preferred Stock within a reasonable time after each
adjustment.

(k) All shares of Common Stock issued upon the conversion of any
Preferred Stock (which is itself fully paid and non-assessable) will, upon issuance, be fully paid
and non-assessable. The Corporation will pay such amounts and will take such other action as
may be necessary from time to time so that all shares of Common Stock which shall be issued
upon the conversion of any Preferred Stock will, upon issuance and without cost to the recipient,
be free from all pre-emptive rights, taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issue thereof.

ARTICLE VI: BY-LAWS

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by statute, the Board is
expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal the By-laws of the Corporation.

ARTICLE VII: MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS

Meetings of Stockholders may be held within or without the State of Delaware, as the
By-laws may provide. The books of the Corporation may be kept (subject to any provisions
contained in the statutes) outside the State of Delaware at such place or places as may be
designated from time to time by the Board or in the By-laws of the Corporation. Written ballots
shall not be required for any vote taken by the Stockholders of the Corporation.

ARTICLE VUI: LIABILITY

The liability of the directors for monetary damages shall be eliminated to the fullest
extent under the Delaware General Corporation Law. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, a director of
the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary
damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability: (i) for any breach of the
director’s duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders; (ii) for acts or omissions not in
good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; (iii) for any
matter in respect of which such director shall be liable under Section 174 of Title 8 of the
Delaware General Corporation Law or any amendment thereto or successor provision thereto; or
(iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. If the
Delaware General Corporation Law is amended to authorize corporate action further eliminating
or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation
shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General
Corporation Law, as so amended.

{a} The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened
to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative by reason of the fact that the person is or was a
director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise (each such person, an “Indemnity Claimant”), against expenses
(including attomeys’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and
reasonably incurred by the Indemnity Claimant in connection with such action, suit or
proceeding if the Indemnity Claimant acted in good faith and in a manner the Indemnity
Claimant reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation,
and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the
Indemnity Claimant’s conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding
by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent,
shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the Indemnity Claimant did not act in good faith and
in a manner which the Indemnity Claimant reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the
best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had
reasonable cause to believe that the Indemnity Claimant’s conduct was unlawful.

14
(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this Article VIII, the Corporation shall
indemnify any Indemnity Claimant who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to
any threatened, pending or completed action, suit by or in the nght of the Corporation to procure
a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that the Indemnity Claimant is or was a director,
officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and
reasonably incurred by the Indemnity Claimant in connection with the defense or settlement of
such action or suit (and any investigation related thereto) if the Indemnity Claimant acted in
good faith and in a manner the Indemnity Claimant reasonably believed to be in or not opposed
to the best interests of the Corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made in
respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which the Indemnity Claimant shall have been
adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery
or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that,
despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, the
Indemnity Claimant is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the
Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.

(c) Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding shall
(in the case of any action, suit or proceeding against a director or officer of the Corporation) or
may (in the case of any action, suit or proceeding against a, trustee, employee or agent) be paid
by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding as
authorized by the Board of Directors upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the
indemnified person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not
entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article VIII. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no advance shall be made by the Corporation if a determination is reasonably and
promptly made at a meeting duly held by a majority vote of disinterested directors that, based
upon the facts known to such disinterested directors at the time such determination is made,
either (i) the Indemnity Claimant did not act in good faith and in a manner which the Indemnity
Claimant reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, (11)
with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, the Indemnity Claimant had reasonable cause
to believe that the Indemnity Claimant’s conduct was unlawful, or (iii) as a result of the alleged
actions by the Indemnity Claimant, it is more likely than not that it will ultimately be determined
that Indemnity Claimant is not entitled to indemnification.

(d) ‘The right to indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted
pursuant to this Article VIII shall not exclude or be exclusive of any other rights to which any
person may be entitled under the bylaws of the Corporation, any contract or agreement between
the Corporation and any officer, director, employee or agent of the Corporation, vote of
stockholders or otherwise. If any officer, director or other person indemnified by the Company
has any right to indemnification from any third party or entity with respect to matters
indemnified by the Company, upon written notice to Company of such right to indemnification
from any such third party or entity, the indemnification of the Company shall be first and
primary, and the Company shall not be entitled to request or cause such officer, director or other
person to seek indemnification from such third party or entity.

15
(3) Neither the amendment nor repeal of this Article VIII, nor the adoption of any
provision of this Certificate inconsistent with this Article VIII, shall eliminate or reduce the
effect of this Article VIII in respect of any matter occurring before such amendment, repeal or
adoption of an inconsistent provision or in respect of any cause of action, suit or claim relating to
any such matter which would have given rise to a right of indemnification or right to receive
expenses pursuant to this Article VIII if such provision had not been so amended or repealed or
if a provision inconsistent therewith had not been so adopted. Notwithstanding any other
provision herein, any right or protection provided under this Article VIII shall be deemed to vest
at the time the act or omission occurred, irrespective of when and whether a proceeding
challenging such act or omission is first threatened or commenced.

ARTICLE IX: SECTION 203

The Corporation expressly elects not to be governed by Section 203 of the Delaware
General Corporation Law.

ARTICLE X: CERTAIN COMPROMISES

Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed between this Corporation and its
creditors or any class of them and/or between this Corporation and its stockholders or any class
of them, any court of equitable jurisdiction within the State of Delaware may, on the application
in a summary way of this Corporation or of any creditor or stockholder thereof or on the
application of any receiver or reccivers appointed for this Corporation under the provisions of
Section 291 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code or on the application of trustees in dissolution or of
any receiver or receivers appointed for this Corporation under the provisions of Section 279 of
Title 8 of the Delaware Code, order a meeting of the creditors or class of creditors and/or of the
stockholders or class of stockholders of this Corporation, as the case may be, to be summoned in
such manner as the said court directs. If a majority in number representing three-fourths in value
of the creditors or class of creditors and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of this
Corporation, as the case may be, agree to any compromise or arrangement and to any
reorganization of this Corporation as consequence of such compromise or arrangement, said
compromise or arrangement and said reorganization shall, if sanctioned by the court to which the
said application has been made, be binding on all the creditors or class of creditors, and/or on all
the stockholders or class of stockholders, of this Corporation, as the case may be, and also on this
Corporation.

ARTICLE XJ]: AMENDMENT OF CERTIFICATE
The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision
contained in this Certificate, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights

conferred upon stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.
