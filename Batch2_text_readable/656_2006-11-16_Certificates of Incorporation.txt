Common Stock held at all meetings of stockholders (and written actions in lieu of meetings); provided,
however, that, except as otherwise required by law, holders of Common Stock, as such, shall not be
entitled to vote on any amendment to this Certificate of Incorporation that relates solely to the terms of
one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either

expressly granted to the Board of Directors from time to time to issue the Preferred Stock in one or more

_ Preferred Stock are as set forth below in this Article Fourth (C).

The holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive dividends, when, as
and if declared by the Board of Directors of the Corporation, out of any assets legally available therefor,
prior and in preference to any declaration or payment of any dividend (payable other than in Common
Stock or other securities and rights convertible into or entitling the holder thereof to receive, directly or
indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock of the Corporation) at the rate of $0.0688 per share (as
adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, reorganizations and like transactions) per annum
on each outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock. Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock and the
Common Stock shall not be mandatory or cumulative and no rights or interest shall accrue to the holders
of Series A Preferred Stock by reason of the fact that the Corporation shall fail to declare or pay dividends
on the Series A Preferred Stock or the Common Stock in any calendar year or any fiscal year of the

sufficient to pay such dividends in whole or in part.

its stockholders (on a pari passu basis with the holders of any class or series of stock ranking on
liquidation on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock), and before any payment shall be made to the
holders of Common Stock or any other class or series of stock ranking on liquidation junior to the
Series A Preferred Stock (such Common Stock and other stock being collectively referred to as “Junior
Stock”) by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount equal to $0.86022 (the “Series A Original Issue
Price”), plus any dividends declared but unpaid thereon (the amount payable pursuant to this sentence is
hereinafter referred to as the “Series A Liquidation Amount”). If upon any such liquidation, dissolution
or winding up of the Corporation the remaining assets available for distribution to its stockholders shall
be insufficient to pay the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and any class or series of stock
ranking on liquidation on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock the full Series A Liquidation Amount
to which they shall be entitled, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and any class or series of
stock ranking on liquidation on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock shall share ratably in any
distribution of the remaining assets available for distribution in proportion to the respective amounts
which would otherwise be payable in respect of the shares held by them upon such distribution if all
amounts payable on or with respect to such shares were paid in full.

Liquidation Amount, the holders of shares of Junior Stock then outstanding shall be entitled to receive

(1) the surviving or resulting corporation or (2) if the surviving or resulting corporation is a wholly
owned subsidiary of another corporation immediately following such merger or consolidation, the parent

majority of the outstanding shares of the class or series entitled to elect such director shall constitute a
quorum for the purpose of electing such director. A vacancy in any directorship filled by the holders of

class or series or by any remaining director or directors elected by the holders of such class or series

thereof or other than as approved by the Board of Directors; or

(v) increase or decrease the authorized number of directors constituting the
Board of Directors from five (5).

4, Optional Conversion.

The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as follows (the
“Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at
the option of the holder thereof, at any time and from time to time, and without the payment of
additional consideration by the holder thereof, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares
of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Series A Original Issue Price (i.e. $0.86022) by the
Series A Conversion Price (as defined below) in effect at the time of conversion. The “Series A
Conversion Price” shall initially be equal to the Series A Original Issue Price. Such initial Series A
Conversion Price, and the rate at which shares of Series A Preferred Stock may be converted into shares
of Common Stock, shall be subject to adjustment as provided below.

In the event of a notice of redemption of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to
Section 6 hereof, the Conversion Rights of the shares designated for redemption shall terminate at the
close of business on the last full day preceding the date fixed for redemption, unless the redemption price
is not paid on such redemption date, in which case the Conversion Rights for such shares shall continue
until such price is paid in full. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation
or a Deemed Liquidation Event, the Conversion Rights shall terminate at the close of business on the last
full day preceding the date fixed for the payment of any such amounts distributable on such event to the
holders of Series A Preferred Stock.

(b) Fractional Shares, No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon
conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would
otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair market
value of a share of Common Stock as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation. Whether or not fractional shares would be issuable upon such conversion shall be
determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock the holder is at the time

Page 6 of 18
MP2 15310033.4
converting into Common Stock and the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such
conversion.

{c) Mechanics of Conversion.

(i) In order for a holder of Series A Preferred Stock to voluntarily convert
shares of Series A Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the
certificate or certificates for such shares of Series A Preferred Stock (or, if such registered holder alleges
that such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement
reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be
made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate), at the
office of the transfer agent for the Series A Preferred Stock (or at the principal office of the Corporation if
the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent), together with written notice that such holder elects to
convert all or any number of the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock represented by such certificate or
certificates and, if applicable, any event on which such conversion is contingent. Such notice shall state
such holder's name or the names of the nominees in which such holder wishes the certificate or
certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued. If required by the Corporation, certificates
surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of
transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or his, her or its
attorney duly authorized in writing. The close of business on the date of receipt by the transfer agent of
such certificates (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement) and notice (or by the Corporation if the
Corporation serves as its own transfer agent) shall be the time of conversion (the “Conversion Time’),
and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the shares represented by such certificate
shail be deemed to be outstanding of record as of such date. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable
after the Conversion Time, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Series A Preferred Stock, or
to his, her or its nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which
such holder shall be entitled, together with cash in lieu of any fraction of a share.

(ii) The Corporation shall at all times when the Series A Preferred Stock shail
be outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued stock, for the purpose of
effecting the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, such number of its duly authorized shares of
Common Stock as shail from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding Series A
Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall
not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, the
Corporation shall take such corporate action as may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including,
without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary
amendment to this Certificate of Incorporation.

(iii) All shares of Series A Preferred Stock which shall have been surrendered
for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights with respect
to such shares, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and to voie, shall immediately cease and
terminate at the Conversion Time, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive shares of
Common Stock in exchange therefor and to receive payment of any dividends declared but unpaid
thereon. Any shares of Series A Preferred Stock so converted shall be retired and cancelled and shail not
be reissued as shares of such series, and the Corporation (without the need for stockholder action) may
from time to time take such appropriate action as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of
shares of Series A Preferred Stock accordingly.

Page 7 of 18
MP2 15310033.4
(iv) | Upon any such conversion, no adjustment to the Series A Conversion
Price shail be made for any declared but unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock surrendered
for conversion or on the Common Stock delivered upon conversion.

(v) The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and other similar taxes that
may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of
shares of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4. The Corporation shall not, however, be
required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and
delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in which the shares of Series A Preferred
Stock so converted were registered, and no such issuance or delivery shall be made unless and until the
person or entity requesting such issuance has paid to the Corporation the amount of any such tax or has
established, to the satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax has been paid.

(d) Adjustments to Series A Conversion Price for Diluting Issues.

(i) Special Definitions. For purposes of this Section4 the following
definitions shall apply:

(A) “Option” shall mean rights, options or warrants to subscribe for,
purchase or otherwise acquire Common Stock or Convertible Securities.

(ii) No Adjustment of Series A Conversion Price. No adjustment in the

Series A Conversion Price shall be made as the result of the issuance of Additional Shares of Common
Stock if: (a) the consideration per share (determined pursuant to Subsection 4{d)(v)) for such Additional
Shares of Common Stock issued or deemed to be issued by the Corporation is equal to or greater than the
applicable Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the issuance or deemed issuance of
such Additional Shares of Common Stock, or (b) prior to such issuance or deemed issuance, the
Corporation receives written notice from the holders of at least two-thirds of the then outstanding shares
of Preferred Stock agreeing that no such adjustment shail be made as the result of the issuance or
deemed issuance of such Additional Shares of Common Stock.

(iii) Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock.

(A) If the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the
Series A Original Issue Date shall issue any Options or Convertible Securities (excluding Options or
‘Convertible Securities which, upon exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, would entitle the holder
thereof to receive Exempted Securities pursuant to Subsections 4(d)(i)(D)(1), (ID), (Ill), or (IV) or shall fix a
record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive any such Options
or Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set forth in the
instrument relating thereto, assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to exercisability, convertibility or
exchangeability but without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of
such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities and
Options therefor, the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to be
Additional Shares of Common Stock issued as of the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shall
have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date.

{B) If the terms of any Option or Convertible Security, the issuance
of which resulted in an adjustment to the Series A Conversion Price pursuant to the terms of Subsection
4(d)(iv) below, are revised (either automatically pursuant to the provisions contained therein or as a
result of an amendment to such terms) to provide for either (1) any increase or decrease in the number of
shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any such Option or
Convertible Security or (2) any increase or decrease in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon
such exercise, conversion or exchange, then, effective upon such increase or decrease becoming effective,
the Series A Conversion Price computed upon the original issue of such Option or Convertible Security
(or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto) shall be readjusted to such Series A
Conversion Price as would have obtained had such revised terms been in effect upon the original date of
issuance of such Option or Convertible Security. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment pursuant
to this clause (B) shall have the effect of increasing the Series A Conversion Price to an amount which
exceeds the lower of (i) the Series A Conversion Price on the original adjustment date, or (ii) the Series A

Page 9 of 18
MP2 15310033.4
Conversion Price that would have resulted from any issuances of Additional Shares of Common Stock
between the original adjustment date and such readjustment date.

(C) If the terms of any Option or Convertible Security (excluding
Options or Convertible Securities which, upon exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, would entitle the

holder thereof to receive Exempted Securities pursuant to Subsections 4(d)(i)(D)(D. (I), (i), or (LV), the

issuance of which did not result in an adjustment to the Series A Conversion Price pursuant to the terms
of Subsection 4fd){iv) below (either because the consideration per share (determined pursuant to
Subsection 4(d)(v) hereof) of the Additional Shares of Common Stock subject thereto was equal to or
greater than the Series A Conversion Price then in effect, or because such Option or Convertible Security
was issued before the Series A Original Issue Date), are revised after the Series A Original Issue Date
(either automatically pursuant to the provisions contained therein or as a result of an amendment to such
terms) to provide for either (1) any increase or decrease in the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any such Option or Convertible Security or (2) any
increase or decrease in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion or
exchange, then such Option or Convertible Security, as so amended, and the Additional Shares of
Common Stock subject thereto (determined in the manner provided in Subsection 4(d){iii)(A) above) shall
be deemed to have been issued effective upon such increase or decrease becoming effective.

(D) Upon the expiration or termination of any unexercised Option or
unconverted or unexchanged Convertible Security which resulted (either upon its original issuance or
upon a revision of its terms) in an adjustment to the Series A Conversion Price pursuant to the terms of
Subsection 4(d){iv) below, the Series A Conversion Price shall be readjusted to such Series A Conversion
Price as would have obtained had such Option or Convertible Security never been issued.

(iv) Adjustment of Series A Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional

Shares of Common Stock. In the event the Corporation, at any time after the Series A Original Issue Date,
issues Additional Shares of Common Stock {including Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to be
issued pursuant to Subsection 4(d)(iii)), without consideration or for a consideration per share less than
the applicable Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issue, then the Series A
Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest one-
hundredth of a cent) determined in accordance with the following formula:

CP2=CPi* (A+B) +(A+C)
For purposes of the foregoing formula, the following definitions shall apply:

immediately after such issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock

(B) CP: shall mean the Series A Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock;

Options outstanding immediately prior to such issue or upon conversion of Convertible Securities
{including the Series A Preferred Stock) outstanding immediately prior to such issue);

Page 10 of 18

‘MP2 15310033.4
(D) “B” shall mean the number of shares of Common Stock that
would have been issued if such Additional Shares of Common Stock had been issued at a price per share
equal to CP; (determined by dividing the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation in respect
of such issue by CP:); and

{E) “C” shall mean the number of such Additional Shares of
Common Stock issued in such transaction.

(v) Determination of Consideration, For purposes of this Subsection 4(d),

issued together with other shares or securities or other
assets of the Corporation for consideration which covers
both, be the proportion of such consideration so

Directors of the Corporation.

(B) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per share

received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued
pursuant to Subsection 4(d)(iii), relating to Options and Convertible Securities, shall be determined by
dividing

subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon
the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities.

(e) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If the Corporation shail at any

time or from time to time after the Series A Original Issue Date effect a subdivision of the outstanding
Common Stock without a comparable subdivision of the Series A Preferred Stock or combine the
outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock without a comparable combination of the Common Stock,
the Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately before that subdivision or combination shall be
proportionately decreased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each
share of such series shall be increased in proportion to such increase in the aggregate number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding. Lf the Corporation shall at any time or from time to time after the Series A
Original Issue Date combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock without a comparable combination
of the Series A Preferred Stock or effect a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred
Stock without a comparable subdivision of the Common Stock, the Series A Conversion Price in effect
immediately before the combination or subdivision shall be proportionately increased so that the number
of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be decreased in
proportion to such decrease in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. Any
adjustment under this subsection shall become effective at the close of business on the date the
subdivision or combination becomes effective.

(f) Adjustment for Certain Dividends and Distributions. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Series A Original Issue Date shall make or issue, or

fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or
other distribution payable on the Common Stock in additional shares of Common Stock, then and in each
such event the Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately before such event shall be decreased as of
the time of such issuance or, in the event such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of
business on such record date, by multiplying the Series A Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction:

(1) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of business on such
record date, and

(2) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of business on such
record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or
distribution;

provided, however, that if such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend is not fully paid or if
such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the Series A Conversion Price shall be
recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record date and thereafter the Series A
Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this subsection as of the time of actual payment of such

Page 12 of 18
MP2 153100334
dividends or distributions; and provided further, however, that no such adjustment shall be made if the
holders of Series A Preferred Stock simultaneously receive (i) a dividend or other distribution of shares of
Common Stock in a number equal to the number of shares of Common Stock as they would have
received if all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock on
the date of such event or (ii) a dividend or other distribution of shares of Series A Preferred Stock which
are convertible, as of the date of such event, into such number of shares of Common Stock as is equal to
the number of additional shares of Common Stock being issued with respect to each share of Common
Stock in such dividend or distribution.

(g) Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. In the event the

Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Series A Original Issue Date shall make or issue, or
fix a record date for the determination of holders of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to receive, a
dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the Corporation (other than a distribution of shares
of Common Stock in respect of outstanding shares of Common Stock) or in other property and the
provisions of Section (C)(1) do not apply to such dividend or distribution, then and in each such event the
holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall receive, simultaneously with the distribution to the holders of
such capital stock, a dividend or other distribution of such securities or other property in an amount
equal to the amount of such securities or other property as they would have received if all outstanding
shares of Series A Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event.

(h) Adjustment for Merger or Reorganization, etc. Subject to the provisions of

Subsection 2(c), if there shall occur any reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or
merger involving the Corporation in which the Common Stock (but not the Series A Preferred Stock) is
converted into or exchanged for securities, cash or other property (other than a transaction covered by
‘Subsections {e), (f) or (g) of this Section 4), then, following any such reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, consolidation or merger, each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall thereafter be
convertible in lieu of the Common Stock into which it was convertible prior to such event into the kind
and amount of securities, cash or other property which a holder of the number of shares of Common
Stock of the Corporation issuable upon conversion of one share of Series A Preferred Stock immediately
prior to such reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger would have been
entitled to receive pursuant to such transaction; and, in such case, appropriate adjustment (as determined
in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation) shall be made in the application of the
provisions in this Section 4 with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the holders of the Series A
Preferred Stock, to the end that the provisions set forth in this Section 4 (including provisions with
respect to changes in and other adjustments of the Series A Conversion Price) shall thereafter be
applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any securities or other property thereafter
deliverable upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock.

(i) Certificate as to Adjustments, The Corporation shall, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the written request at any time of any holder of Series A Preferred Stock (but in any
event not later than ten (10) days thereafter), furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a certificate
setting forth (i) the Series A Conversion Price then in effect, and (ii) the number of shares of Common
Stock and the amount, if any, of other securities, cash or property which then would be received upon the
conversion of Series A Preferred Stock.

Page 13 of 18
MP2 15310033.4
(j) Notice of Record Date. In the event:

(i) the Corporation shall take a record of the holders of its Common Stock
(or other stock or securities at the time issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock) for the
purpose of entitling or enabling them to receive any dividend or other distribution, or to receive any right
to subscribe for or purchase any shares of stock of any class or any other securities, or to receive any other

right; or

(ii) of any capital reorganization of the Corporation, any reclassification of
the Common Stock of the Corporation, or any Deemed Liquidation Event; or

(iii) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of
the Corporation,

then, and in each such case, the Corporation will send or cause to be sent to each holder of the Series A
Preferred Stock a notice specifying, as the case may be, (i) the record date for such dividend, distribution
or right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right, or (ii) the effective date on
which such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or
winding-up is proposed to take place, and the time, if any is to be fixed, as of which the holders of record
of Common Stock (or such other stock or securities at the time issuable upon the conversion of the Series
A Preferred Stock) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock (or such other stock or
securities) for securities or other property deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification,
consolidation, merger, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, and the amount per share and
character of such exchange applicable to the Series A Preferred Stock and the Common Stock. Such
notice shall be sent at least ten (10) days prior to the record date or effective date for the event specified in
such notice. Any notice required by the provisions hereof to be given to a holder of shares of Preferred
Stock shall be deerned sent to such holder if deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, and
addressed to such holder at his, her or its address appearing on the books of the Corporation.

recapitalizations affecting such shares), in a firm-commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to
an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, resulting in at least
$30,000,000 of proceeds, net of the underwriting discount and commissions, to the Corporation (a
“Qualifying Public Offering”) or (B) a date specified by vote or written consent of the holders of at least
two-thirds of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (the “Mandatory Conversion Date”), (i) all
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock, at
the then effective conversion rate and (ii) such shares may not be reissued by the Corporation as shares of
such series.

{b)} All holders of record of shares of Preferred Stock shall be given written notice of
the Mandatory Conversion Date and the place designated for mandatory conversion of all such shares of
Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 5. Such notice need not be given in advance of the occurrence of
the Mandatory Conversion Date. Such notice shall be sent by first class or registered mail, postage
prepaid, or given by electronic communication in compliance with the provisions of the General

Page 14 of 18
MP2 15310033.4
Corporation Law, to each record holder of Preferred Stock. Upon receipt of such notice, each holder of
shares of Preferred Stock shall surrender his, her or its certificate or certificates for all such shares to the
Corporation at the place designated in such notice, and shall thereafter receive certificates for the number
of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Section 5. On the Mandatory
Conversion Date, all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have been converted into
shares of Common Stock, which shall be deemed to be outstanding of record, and all rights with respect
to the Preferred Stock so converted, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and vote (other than as
a holder of Common Stock), will terminate, except only the rights of the holders thereof, upon surrender
of their certificate or certificates therefor, to receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock
into which such Preferred Stock has been converted, and payment of any declared but unpaid dividends
thereon. If so required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or
accompanied by written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation,
duly executed by the registered holder or by his, her or its attorney duly authorized in writing. As soon
as practicable after the Mandatory Conversion Date and the surrender of the certificate or certificates for
Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall cause to be issued and delivered to such holder, or on his, her or its
written order, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable on such
conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof and cash as provided in Subsection 4(b) in respect of
any fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion.

(c) All certificates evidencing shares of Preferred Stock which are required to be
surrendered for conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof shail, from and after the Mandatory
Conversion Date, be deemed to have been retired and cancelled and the shares of Preferred Stock
represented thereby converted into Common Stock for all purposes, notwithstanding the failure of the
holder or holders thereof to surrender such-certificates on or prior to such date. Such converted Preferred

‘Stock may not be reissued as shares of the series from which it was converted, and the Corporation may

thereafter take such appropriate action (without the need for stockholder action) as may be necessary to
reduce the authorized number of shares of the applicable series of Preferred Stock accordingly.

6. Redemption.

(a) Redemption. Shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be redeemed by the
Corporation out of funds lawfully available therefor at a price equal to the Series A Liquidation Amount
(the “Redemption Price”), in three annual installments commencing 60 days after receipt by the
Corporation at any time on or after the fourth anniversary of the date on which the first share of Series A
Preferred Stock was issued, from the holders of at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the then
outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, of written notice requesting redemption of all shares of
Series A Preferred Stock (the date of each such installment being referred to as a “Redemption Date”).
On each Redemption Date, the Corporation shall redeem, on a pro rata basis in accordance with the

Series A Preferred Stock determined by dividing (i) the total number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such Redemption Date by (ii) the number of remaining Redemption
Dates (including the Redemption Date to which such calculation applies). If the Corporation does not
have sufficient funds legally available to redeem on any Redemption Date all shares of Series A Preferred
Stock and of any other class or series of stock to be redeemed on such Redemption Date, the Corporation
shall redeem a pro rata portion of each holder's redeemable shares of such stock out of funds legally
available therefor, based on the respective amounts which would otherwise be payable in respect of the
shares to be redeemed if the legally available funds were sufficient to redeem all such shares, and shall

Page 15 of 18
‘MP2 $5310033.4
redeem the remaining shares to have been redeemed as soon as practicable after the Corporation has
funds legally available therefor.

Redemption Notice. Written notice of the mandatory redemption (the
“Redemption Notice’) shall be mailed, postage prepaid, to each holder of record of Series A Preferred
Stock, at its post office address last shown on the records of the Corporation, or given by electronic
communication in compliance with the provisions of the General Corporation Law, not less than 40 days

Redemption Date specified in the Redemption Notice;

(II) the Redemption Date and the Redemption Price;

(I) the date upon which the holder’s right to convert such
shares terminates (as determined in accordance with

Section 4(a)); and

(IV) that the holder is to surrender to the Corporation, in the
manner and at the place designated, his, her or its
certificate or certificates representing the shares of Series
A Preferred Stock to be redeemed.

(c) Surrender of Certificates; Payment. On or before the applicable Redemption

Date, each holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such Redemption Date, unless

the place designated in the Redemption Notice, and thereupon the Redemption Price for such shares shall
be payable to the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner
thereof, and each surrendered certificate shal} be canceled and retired. In the event less than all of the
shares of Series A Preferred Stock represented by a certificate are redeemed, a new certificate
representing the unredeemed shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall promptly be issued to such holder.

(d) Rights Subsequent to Redemption. If the Redemption Notice shall have been
duly given, and if on the applicable Redemption Date the Redemption Price payable upon redemption of
the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such Redemption Date is paid or tendered for
payment or deposited with an independent payment agent so as to be available therefor, then
notwithstanding that the certificates evidencing any of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock so called for
redemption shall not have been surrendered, dividends with respect to such shares of Preferred Stock
shall cease to accrue after such Redemption Date and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith
after the Redemption Date terminate, except only the right of the holders to receive the Redemption Price
without interest upon surrender of their certificate or certificates therefor.

(e) Redeemed or Otherwise Acquired Shares. Any shares of Preferred Stock which

are redeemed or otherwise acquired by the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries shall be automatically
and immediately canceled and shail not be reissued, sold or transferred and the Corporation may
