from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates). Thereupon, there shall be
issued and delivered to such holder promptly at such office and in its name as shown on such
surrendered certificate or certificates (or as set forth in the indemnity agreement), a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Preferred Stock
surrendered were convertible on the date on which such automatic conversion occurred and any

be the number of shares of Common.Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to such’
Common Stock Event, and (ii) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately after such Common Stock Event, and the

product so obtained shall thereafter be the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock.

the happening of each subsequent Common Stock Event. As used herein, the term the

“Common Stock Event? shall mean at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue

Date, (i) the issue by the Corporation of additional shares of Common Stock as a dividend o1

other distribution on outstanding Common Stock, (ii) a subdivision of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, or (iii) a combination of the

outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock

time to time after the Original Issue Date the Corpotation pays a dividend or makes another
distribution to the holders of the Common Stock payable in securities of the Corporation, other
than an event constituting a Common Stock Event, then in each such event provision shall be
made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock shall receive upon conversion thereof, in addition
to the number of shares of Common Stock receivable upon conversion thereof, the amount of
securities of the Corporation which they would have reccived had their Preferred Stock been
converted into Common Stock on the date of such event (or such record date, as applicable) and
had they thereaftc:, during the period fiom the date of such event (or such record date, as
applicable) to and including the conversion date, retained such securities receivable by them as
aforesaid during such period, subject to all other adjustments called for during such period under
this Section 6 with respect to the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock or with respect to

time or fiom time to time after the Original Issue Date the Common Stock issuable upon the

conversion of the Preferred Stock is changed into the same or a different number of shares of any
class or classes of stock, whether by recapitalization, reclassification or otherwise (other than by
a Common Stock Event or a stock dividend, reorganization, merger, o1 consolidation provided
for elsewhere in this Section 6), then in any such evént each holder of Preferred Stock shall have
the right thereafter to convert such stock into the kind and amount of stock and other securities
and property receivable upon such recapitalization, reclassification or other change by holders of
the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Preferred Stock could have
been converted immediately prior to such recapitalization, reclassification or change, all subject

recapitalization, subdivision, combination, reclassification or exchange of shares provided for
elsewhere in this Section 6) or a merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into another
corporation (except an event which is governed under Section 3.3), then, as a part of such
reorganization, merger or consolidation, provision shall be made so that the holders of the
Preferred Stock thereafter shall be entitled to receive, upon conversion of the Preferred Stock, the
number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the Corporation, or of such successor
corporation resulting from such reorganization, merger or consolidation, to which a holder of
Common Stock deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled on such reorganization,
merge: or consolidation. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the
application of the provisions of this Section 6 with respect to the rights of the holders of the
Preferred Stock after the reorganization, merger or consolidation to the end that the provisions of
this Section 6 (including adjustment of the Conversion Price then in effect and number of shares
issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event and be as
nearly equivalent to the provisions hereof as may be practicable. This Section 6 7 shall similarly
apply to successive reorganizations, mergers and consolidations. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Section 6, if any reorganization, merge: or consolidation is approved
by the vote of stockholders required by Section 7 hereof, then such transaction and the rights of
the holders of Preferred Stock and Common Stock pursuant to such reorganization, merger or
consolidation will be governed by the documents entered into in connection with such
transaction and not by the provisions of this Section 6.7.

14
24223/00010/D0CS/1913493 9
exercised, then the Conversion Price as adjusted upon the issuance of such Rights or Options or
Convertible Securities shall be readjusted to the Conversion Price which would have been in
effect had an adjustment been made on the basis that the only shares of Common Stock so issued
were the shares of Common Stock, if any, that were actually issued or sold on the exercise of
such Rights or Options or rights of conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, and
such shares of Common Stock, if any, were issued or sold for the consideration actually received
by the Corporation upon such exercise, plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the
Corporation for the granting of all such Rights or Options, whether or not exercised, plus the
consideration received for issuing or selling all such Convertible Securities actually converted or

upon any conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional share to which the holder
would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay the holder cash equal to the product of
such fraction multiplied by the Common Stock’s fair market value as determined in good faith
by the Board as of the date of conversion.

612 Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at
all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock,

solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock, such
number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate
action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shal! be sufficient for such purpose.

613 Notices of Record Date. In the event that the Corporation shall propose at
