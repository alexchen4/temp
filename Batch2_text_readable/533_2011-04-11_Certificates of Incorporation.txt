shall be valued as follows:

similar restrictions on free marketability:

(1) _ If traded on a securities exchange or The
Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”), the value shall be based on the formula specified in the

of such securities shall be based on a formula approved by the Board of Directors and derived
from the closing prices of the securities on such exchange or Nasdaq over a specified time
period;

(2) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value
shall be based on the formula specified in the definitive agreements for the Liquidation
Transaction or, if no such formula exists, then the value of such securities shall be based on a
formula approved by the Board of Directors and derived from the closing bid or sales prices
(whichever is applicable) of such securities over a specified time period; and

-6-

918478 v6/HN
(3) If there is no active public market, the value
shall be the fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(B) The method of valuation of securities subject to
investment letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely
by virtue of a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an
appropriate discount from the market value determined as specified above in Section 2(c)(ii)(A)
to reflect the approximate fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors.

(iii) Notice of Transaction. The Corporation shall give each
holder of record of Series A-1, Series B, Series C, Series D, Series E and Series F Preferred

transaction shall in no event take place sooner than 20 days after the Corporation has given the
first notice provided for herein or sooner than 10 days after the Corporation has given notice of
any material changes provided for herein, whichever is later. Unless otherwise stated in this

shortened or waived, either before or after the action for which notice is required, upon the
written consent of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares that are

this Section 2(c) are not complied with, the Corporation shall forthwith either cause the closing
of the Liquidation Transaction to be postponed until the applicable requirements of this Section 2

preferences, privileges and restrictions of the holders of Series A-1, Series B, Series C, Series D,

Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, respectively, to be redeemed shall surrender to the
Corporation the certificate or certificates representing such shares, in the manner and at the place
designated by the Corporation, and thereupon the Redemption Price of such shares shall be

-10-

918478 v6/HN
payable to the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the
owner thereof and each surrendered certificate shall be cancelled. In the event less than all the
shares represented by any such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued
representing the unredeemed shares.

(d) Effect of Redemption; Insufficient Funds. From and after each
Series F Redemption Date, Series E Redemption Date, Series D Redemption Date or Series B
Redemption Date, unless there shall have been a default in payment of the Redemption Price for
the applicable series, all rights of the holders of shares of Series F Preferred Stock, Series E
Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, respectively, designated
for redemption on each such date (except the right to receive the Redemption Price for the
applicable series without interest upon surrender of their certificate or certificates) shall cease
with respect to such shares, and such shares shall not thereafter be transferred on the books of the
Corporation or be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose whatsoever. Ifthe funds of the
Corporation legally available for redemption of shares of Series F Preferred Stock, Series E
Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock on any Series F
Redemption Date, Series E Redemption Date, Series D Redemption Date or Series B
Redemption Date, respectively, are insufficient to redeem the total number of shares of Series F
Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock
to be redeemed on such dates, those funds which are legally available will be used to redeem the
maximum possible number of such shares, and shares of Series F Preferred Stock, Series E
Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock shall be redeemed ratably
in respective proportion to the full amounts to which they would be entitled to if the total number
of shares of Series F Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock or
Series B Preferred Stock were redeemed. The shares of Series F Preferred Stock, Series E
Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock not redeemed shall remain
outstanding and entitled to all the rights and preferences provided herein. At any time thereafter
when additional funds of the Corporation are legally available for the redemption of shares of
Series F Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock or Series B
Preferred Stock, such funds wil! immediately be used to redeem the balance of the shares which
the Corporation has become obliged to redeem on any Series F Redemption Date, Series E
Redemption Date, Series D Redemption Date or Series B Redemption Date but which it has not
redeemed.

(e) Other Preferred Stock. Series A-1 and Series C Preferred Stock
shall not be redeemable.

4. Conversion. The holders of the Series A-1, Series B, Series C, Series D,
Series E and Series F Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as follows (the “Conversion

Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Subject to Section 4(c), each share of
Series A-1, Series B, Series C, Series D, Series E and Series F Preferred Stock shall be
convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such
share, at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for such stock, into such number of

-11-

918478 v6/HN
fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing (i) the Series
A-1 Original Issue Price applicable to any such share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock by the
Conversion Price applicable to such share, (ii) the Series B Original Issue Price applicable to any
such share of Series B Preferred Stock by the Conversion Price applicable to such share, (iii) the
Series C Original Issue Price applicable to any such share of Series C Preferred Stock by the
Conversion Price applicable to such share, (iv) the Series D Original Issue Price applicable to any
such share of Series D Preferred Stock by the Conversion Price applicable to such share, (v) the
Series E Original Issue Price applicable to any such share of Series E Preferred Stock by the
Conversion Price applicable to such share and (vi) the Series F Original Issue Price applicable to
any such share of Series F Preferred Stock by the Conversion Price applicable to such share,
determined as hereafter provided, in effect on the date the certificate is surrendered for
conversion. The initial Conversion Price per share shall be $1.00 for the Series A-1 Preferred
Stock, $2.16742 for the Series B Preferred Stock, $3.45 for the Series C Preferred Stock, $2.70
for the Series D Preferred Stock, $3.27 for the Series E Preferred Stock and $3.50 for the Series F
Preferred Stock. Such initial Conversion Prices shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in
Section 4(d) below.

(b) Automatic Conversion.

(i) Each share of Series A-1, Series B, Series C, Series D,
Series E or Series F Preferred Stock that has not already been converted pursuant to Section
4(b)(ii) shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Price at
the time in effect for such share immediately upon the Corporation’s sale of its Common Stock in
a firm commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to a registration statement under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), the public offering price of which is
not less than $10.50 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reclassification and
the like) and which results in aggregate cash proceeds to the Corporation of not less than
$40,000,000 (before deduction of underwriting discounts and commissions) (a “Qualified IPO”).

(ii) Prior to a Qualified IPO, each share of Series A-1, Series B,
Series C, Series D, Series E and Series F Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into
shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Price at the time in effect for such share immediately
upon the date specified by written consent or agreement of the holders of (A) a majority of the
then outstanding shares of Series A-1, Series B, Series C, Series D, Series E and Series F
Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class on an as-converted basis and (B) at least 75% of
the then outstanding shares of Series E and Series F Preferred Stock, voting together as a single
class on an as-converted basis.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Series A-1,
Series B, Series C, Series D, Series E or Series F Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert such
Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, the holder shall surrender the certificate or
certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for
such series of Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the Corporation at its principal
corporate office, of the election to convert the same and shall state therein the name or names in
which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued. The

-]2-

918478 v6/HN
Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder
of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for
the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid. Such
conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the
date of such surrender of the shares of such series of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the
person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion
shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of public Common
Stock as of such date. If the conversion is in connection with an underwritten public offering of
securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act the conversion may, at the option of any
holder tendering such Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the
underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering, in which event any persons
entitled to receive Common Stock upon conversion of such Preferred Stock shall not be deemed
to have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of
securities.

(d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock for Certain
Dilutive Issuances, Splits and Combinations. The Conversion Price of the Series F, Series E,
Series D and Series B Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as

follows:

(i) Issuance of Additional Stock below Purchase Price. If
the Corporation should issue, at any time after the date upon which any shares of such series of
Preferred Stock were first issued (the “Purchase Date” with respect to such series), any
Additional Stock (as defined below) without consideration or for a consideration per share less
than the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to the
issuance of such Additional Stock, the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock in
effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall automatically be adjusted as set forth in this
Section 4(d)(i), unless otherwise provided in this Section 4(d)(i).

(A) Adjustment Formula. Whenever the Conversion
Price is adjusted pursuant to this Section (4)(d)(i), the new Conversion Price shall be determined
by multiplying the Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction, (x) the numerator of which shall
be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance (the
“Outstanding Common”) plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate
consideration received by the Corporation for such issuance would purchase at such Conversion
Price; and (y) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Outstanding Common
plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock (as defined below). For purposes of the
foregoing calculation, the term “Outstanding Common” shall include shares of Common Stock
deemed issued pursuant to Section 4(d)(i)(E) below.

(B) Definition of “Additional Stock”. For purposes of
this Section 4(d)(i), “Additional Stock” shall mean any shares of Common Stock issued (or
deemed to have been issued pursuant to Section 4(d)(i)(E)) by the Corporation after the Purchase
Date) other than:

-13-

918478 v6/HN
(1) Common Stock issued pursuant to stock
dividends, stock splits or similar transactions, as described in Section 4(d)(ii) hereof;

(2) Up to 7,682,382 shares of Common Stock
issued or issuable to employees, consultants or directors of the Corporation directly or pursuant
to a stock option plan or restricted stock plan approved by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation (or such higher number of shares unanimously approved by the Board of Directors
and approved, within one year of such issuance, by the holders of a majority of the then
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a class);

(3) Capital stock, or options or warrants to
purchase capital stock, issued to financial institutions or lessors in connection with commercial
credit arrangements, equipment financings, commercial property lease transactions or similar
transactions in a transaction and in an amount approved by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation;

(4) Shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock
issuable upon exercise of warrants outstanding as of the date of this Restated Certificate;

(5) Capital stock, or warrants or options to
purchase capital stock, issued in connection with bona fide acquisitions, mergers or similar
transactions, the terms of which are approved by the Board of Directors of the Corporation;

(6) Shares of Common Stock issued or issuable
upon conversion of the Series A-1, Series B, Series C, Series D, Series E or Series F Preferred
Stock;

(7) Shares of Common Stock issued or issuable
in a public offering prior to or in connection with which all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock
will be converted to Common Stock; or

(8) | Capital stock issued or issuable to an entity
as a component of any business relationship with such entity for the purpose of (A) joint venture,
technology licensing or development activities, (B) distribution, supply or manufacture of the
Corporation’s products or services or (C) any other arrangements involving corporate partners
that are primarily for purposes other than raising capital, the terms of which business relationship
with such entity are approved by the Board of Directors.

(C) No Fractional Adjustments. No adjustment of the
Conversion Price for the Series F, Series E, Series D or Series B Preferred Stock shall be made in
an amount less than one cent per share, provided that any adjustments which are not required to
be made by reason of this sentence shall be carried forward and shall be either taken into account
in any subsequent adjustment made prior to three years from the date of the event giving rise to
the adjustment being carried forward, or shall be made at the end of three years from the date of
the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward.

-14-

918478 v6/HN
(D) Determination of Consideration. In the case of
the issuance of Common Stock for cash, the consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of
cash paid therefor before deducting any reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses
allowed, paid or incurred by the Corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection
with the issuance and sale thereof. In the case of the issuance of the Common Stock for a
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be
deemed to be the fair value thereof as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors
irrespective of any accounting treatment.

{E) Deemed Issuances of Common Stock. In the case
of the issuance (whether before, on or after the applicable Purchase Date) of securities or rights
convertible into, or entitling the holder thereof to receive directly or indirectly, additional shares
of Common Stock (the “Common Stock Equivalents”), the following provisions shall apply for
all purposes of this Section 4(d)(i):

(1) The aggregate maximum number of shares
of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion, exchange or exercise (assuming the satisfaction
of any conditions to convertibility, exchangeability or exercisability, including, without
limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account potential antidilution
adjustments) of any Common Stock Equivalents and subsequent conversion, exchange or
exercise thereof shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or
such Common Stock Equivalents were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration,
if any, received by the Corporation for any such securities and related Common Stock
Equivalents (excluding any cash received on account of accrued interest or accrued dividends),
plus the minimum additional consideration, if any, to be received by the Corporation (without
taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) upon the conversion, exchange or exercise
of any Common Stock Equivalents (the consideration in each case to be determined in the
manner provided in Section 4(d)(i)(D).

(2) In the event of any change in the number of
shares of Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon
conversion, exchange or exercise of any Common Stock Equivalents, other than a change
resulting from the antidilution provisions thereof, the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred
Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such Common Stock Equivalents,
shall be recomputed to reflect such change, but no further adjustment shail be made for the actual
issuance of Common Stock or any payment of such consideration upon the conversion, exchange
or exercise of such Common Stock Equivalents.

(3) | Upon the termination or expiration of the
convertibility, exchangeability or exercisability of any Common Stock Equivalents, the
Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or
computed using such Common Stock Equivalents, shall be recomputed to reflect the issuance of
only the number of shares of Common Stock (and Common Stock Equivalents that remain
convertible, exchangeable or exercisable) actually issued upon the conversion, exchange or
exercise of such Common Stock Equivalents.

-15-

918478 v6/HN
(4) The number of shares of Common Stock
deemed issued and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to Section 4(d)(i)(E)(1) shall
be appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or expiration of the type described in
either Section 4(d)(i)(E)(2) or 4(d)()(E)(3).

(F) NoIncreased Conversion Price. Notwithstanding
any other provisions of this Section (4)(d)(i), except to the limited extent provided for in
Sections 4(d)(i)(E)(2) and 4(d)()(E)(3), no adjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this
Section 4(d)(i) shall have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price above the Conversion
Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment.

(ii) Stock Splits and Dividends. In the event the Corporation
should at any time after the Purchase Date fix a record date for the effectuation of a split or
subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or the determination of holders of
Common Stock entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of
Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents without payment of any consideration by such
holder for the additional shares of Common Stock or the Common Stock Equivalents (including
the additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof), then, as of
such record date (or the date of such dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no record date
is fixed), the Conversion Price of each of the Series A-1, Series B, Series C, Series D, Series E
and Series F Preferred Stock shall be appropriately decreased so that the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be increased in
proportion to such increase of the aggregate of shares of Common Stock outstanding and those
issuable with respect to such Common Stock Equivalents with the number of shares issuable
with respect to Common Stock Equivalents determined from time to time as provided in Section

4(d)()(E).

(iii) Reverse Stock Splits. If the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding at any time after the Purchase Date is decreased by a combination of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock, then, following the record date of such combination, the
Conversion Price for each of the Series A-1, Series B, Series C, Series D, Series E and Series F
Preferred Stock shall be appropriately increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be decreased in proportion to such
decrease in outstanding shares.

(e) Other Distributions. In the event the Corporation shall declare a
distribution or dividend payable in securities of the Corporation in connection with Section
4(d)(i1), then, in each such case for the purpose of this Section 4(e), the holders of Series A-1,
Series B, Series C, Series D, Series E and Series F Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a
proportionate share of any such distribution as though they were the holders of the number of
shares of Common Stock of the Corporation into which their shares of Preferred Stock are
convertible as of the record date fixed for the determination of the holders of Common Stock of
the Corporation entitled to receive such distribution.

-16-

918478 v6/HN
(f) Recapitalizations. If at any time or from time to time there shall
be a recapitalization of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision, combination or merger or
sale of assets transaction provided for elsewhere in this Section 4 or in Section 2) provision shall
be made so that the holders of the Series A-1, Series B, Series C, Series D, Series E and Series F
Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of such Preferred Stock
the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the Corporation or otherwise, to
which a holder of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled on such
recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the
provisions of this Section 4 with respect to the rights of the holders of such Preferred Stock after
the recapitalization to the end that the provisions of this Section 4 (including adjustment of the
Conversion Price then in effect and the number of shares purchasable upon conversion of such
Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event and be as nearly equivalent as practicable.

(g) | NoImpairment. The Corporation will not, by amendment of its
Certificate of Incorporation (except in accordance with Section 6 hereof and applicable law) or
through any reorganization, recapitalization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution,
issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or
performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Corporation, but
will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Section 4 and
in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the
Conversion Rights of the holders of Preferred Stock against impairment.

(h) No Fractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments.

(i) No fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of
any share or shares of the Series A-1, Series B, Series C, Series D, Series E or Series F Preferred
Stock, and the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued shall be rounded down to the
nearest whole share. The number of shares issuable upon such conversion shall be determined
on the basis of the total number of shares of Series A-1, Series B, Series C, Series D, Series E or
Series F Preferred Stock the holder is at the time converting into Common Stock and the number
of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such aggregate conversion. If conversion would result
in any fractional share, the Corporation shall, in lieu of issuing any such fractional share, pay the
holder thereof an amount of cash equal to the fair market value of such fractional share on the
date of conversion, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(ii) | Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of
the Conversion Price of Series A-1, Series B, Series C, Series D, Series E or Series F Preferred
Stock pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation, at its expense, shall promptly compute such
adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and prepare and furnish to each
holder of such Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and
showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The
Corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of Series A-1, Series B,
Series C, Series D, Series E or Series F Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such
holder a like certificate setting forth (A) such adjustment and readjustment, (B) the Conversion
Price for such series of Preferred Stock at the time in effect, and (C) the number of shares of

-17-

918478 v6/HN
Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received
upon the conversion of a share of the such series of Preferred Stock.

(i) Notices of Record Date. In the event of any taking by the
Corporation of a record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining
the holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend) or other
distribution, any right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of stock of any
class or any other securities or property, or to receive any other right, the Corporation shall mail
to each holder of Series A-1, Series B, Series C, Series D, Series E and Series F Preferred Stock,
at least 10 days prior to the date specified therein, a notice specifying the date on which any such
record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or right, and the amount and
character of such dividend, distribution or right.

(j) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion, The
Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares

of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the

Series A-1, Series B, Series C, Series D, Series E and Series F Preferred Stock, such number of
its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all
outstanding shares of such series of Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized
but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then
outstanding shares of such series of Preferred Stock, in addition to such other remedies as shall
be available to the holder of such Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate
action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes,
including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval
of any necessary amendment to this Restated Certificate.

(k) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Section 4 to
be given to the holders of shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed given if deposited in the
United States mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to each holder of record at his address
appearing on the books of the Corporation.

(1) Waiver of Adjustment of Conversion Price. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, any downward adjustment of the Conversion Price of any series

of Preferred Stock may be waived by the consent or vote of the holders of at least 51% of the
Series A-1 Preferred Stock if so affected, voting as a single class; at least 51% of the Series B
Preferred Stock if so affected, voting as a single class; at least 51% of the Series C Preferred
Stock if so affected, voting together as a single class; at least 51% of the Series D Preferred Stock
if so affected, voting together as a single class; at least 51% of the Series E Preferred Stock if so
affected, voting together as a single class; and at least 51% of the Series F Preferred Stock if so
affected, voting together as a single class, in all instances before the issuance causing the
adjustment.

(a) General. Except as expressly provided by this Certificate or as
provided by law, the holders of Series A-1, Series B, Series C, Series D, Series E and Series F

converted. Fractional votes shall not, however, be permitted and any fractional voting rights
available on an as-converted basis (after aggregating all shares into which shares of Series A-1,
Series B, Series C, Series D, Series E or Series F Preferred Stock held by each holder could be
converted) shall be rounded to the nearest whole number (with one-half being rounded upward).

(b) — Election of Directors. The holders of Series F Preferred Stock
