of the surviving or acquiring entity (an “Acquisition”); or (B) a sale or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Corporation (an “Asset Transfer”).

SV\1320853.7
A0738791

Directors, except that any securities to be distributed to the shareholders shall be valued as
follows:

(A) Securities not subject to investment letter or other
similar restrictions on free marketability covered by (B) below:

(1) If traded on a securities exchange or through
the Nasdaq Global Market, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing sale prices
of the securities on such quotation system over the thirty (30) day period ending three (3) days
prior to the closing of an event described in subparagraph (c)(i) of this Section 2;

(2) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value
shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over
the thirty (30) day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing of an event described in
subparagraph (c)(i) of this Section 2; and

(3) ‘If there is no active public market, the value
shall be the fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Corporation and the holders
of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of Series Preferred.

(B) The method of valuation of securities subject to
investment letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely
by virtue of a shareholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an
appropriate discount from the market value determined as above in subparagraphs (A) (1), (2) or
(3) of this Section 2 to reflect the approximate fair market value thereof, as mutually determined
by the Corporation and the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then
outstanding shares of Series Preferred.

(ii) | The Corporation shall pive each holder of record of Series
Preferred written notice of such impending transaction described in subparagraph (c)(i) of this
Section 2 not later than twenty (20) days prior to the shareholders’ meeting called to approve
such transaction, or twenty (20) days prior to the closing of such transaction, whichever is
earlier, and shall also notify such holders in writing of the final approval of such transaction.
The first of such notices shall describe the material terms and conditions of the impending
transaction and the provisions of this Section 2, and the Corporation shall thereafter give such
holders prompt notice of any material changes. The transaction shall in no event take place
sooner than twenty (20) days after the Corporation has given the first notice provided for herein
or sooner than ten (10) days after the Corporation has given notice of any material changes
provided for herein; provided, however, that such periods may be shortened upon the written
consent of the holders of Series Preferred representing at least a majority of the voting power of
all then outstanding shares of Series Preferred.

3, Redemption. The Series Preferred is not redeemable.
4. Conversion. The holders of the Series Preferred shall have conversion
rights as follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

108011106 v2
SV\L320853.7
A0758791

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Series Preferred shall be
convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such
share, at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for such stock, into such number of
fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Original
Issue Price of the applicable series of Series Preferred by the conversion price applicable to such
share, determined as hereafter provided, in effect on the date the certificate is surrendered for
conversion. Upon the date of the filing of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation
with the California Secretary of State (the “File Date”), the initial conversion price per share for
shares of (i) Serics A Preferred Stock shall be $0.3447; (ii) Series B Preferred Stock shall be
$0.4675; (iii) Series C Preferred Stock shall be $0.3405; (iv) Series D Preferred Stock shall be.
$0.3405; (v) Series E Preferred Stock shall be $0,5832; (vi) Series F Preferred Stock shall be
$0.2122; and (vii) Series G Preferred Stock shall be $0.3750 (the “Conversion Price,”
respectively, for each series of Series Preferred and as may be adjusted pursuant to this Section

4(a)).

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Series Preferred shall
automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the applicable Conversion Price at
the time in effect for such series of Series Preferred immediately upon the earlier of (i) the
Corporation's sale of its Common Stock in a firm commitment underwritten public offering
pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
“Securities Act”), the public offering price of which equals or exceeds $1.32 per share (adjusted
to reflect subsequent stock dividends, stock splits or recapitalization), with a total offering, after
deduction of underwriters’ commissions and expenses, of at least $30,000,000 or (ii) the date
specified by written consent or approval of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series
Preferred, voting together as a single class on an as-converted to Common Stock basis. Upon
such automatic conversion, any declared and unpaid dividends shall be paid in accordance with
the provisions of Article Ill, Section B(1).

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Series Preferred
shall be entitled to convert the same into sliares of Common Stock, the holder shall surrender the
certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any
transfer agent for the Series Preferred, and shall give written notice to the Corporation at its
principal corporate office of the election to convert the same and shall state therein the name or
names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued. The
Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such
holder of Series Preferred, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shat! be entitled as
aforesaid. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of
business on the date of such surrender of the certificate or certificates representing the shares of
Series Preferred to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record
holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock as of such date. If the conversion is in
connection with an underwritten offering of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act,
the conversion shall be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of
securities pursuant to such offering, in which event the person(s) entitled to receive the Common
Stock upon conversion of the Series Preferred shall not be deemed to have converted such Scries
Preferred until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities.

(d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Series Preferred for Certain
Dilutive Issuances, Splits and Combinations. The respective Conversion Prices of the Series
Preferred shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

(i) (A) In the event the Corporation shall issue or be
deemed pursuant to the terms hereof to have issued, after the File Date, any Additional Stock (as
defined below) without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the then
applicable Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock or
Series C Preferred Stock or Series D Preferred Stock or Series E Preferred Stock or Series F
Preferred Stock or Series G Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such
Additional Stock, the Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred Stock and/or Series B
Preferred Stock and/or Series C Preferred Stock and/or Series D Preferred Stock and/or Series E
Preferred Stock and/or Series F Preferred Stock and/or Series G Preferred Stock in effect
immediately prior to cach such issuance shall forthwith (except as otherwise provided in this
Section 4(d)(i)) be adjusted to a price determined by multiplying the then applicable Conversion
Price of the applicable series of Series Preferred by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be
equal to the total computed under clause (1) below and the denominator of which shall be equal
to the total computed under clause (2) below:

(1) an amount equal to the sum of (a) the number of shares of Outstanding
Common Stock (as such term is defined below) outstanding immediately
prior to such issue or sale, plus (b) the number of shares of Outstanding
Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received (or deemed
received) by the Corporation for the total number of Additional Stock so
issued (or deemed issued) would purchase at such Conversion Price, and

(2) an amount equal to the sum of (a) the number of shares of Outstanding
‘Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale plus
(b) the number of such Additional Stock so issued (or deemed issued).

As used herein, the term “Outstanding Common Stock” means all shares of Common Stock that
are outstanding plus all shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of Series Preferred,
or the exercise of any outstanding options or warrants.

(B) No adjustment of the Conversion Price for the
Series Preferred shall be made in an amount less than one tenth of one cent per share, provided

carried forward and shall be either taken into account in any subsequent adjustment made prior
to three years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward, or
shall be made at the end of three years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment
being carried forward; and provided further that in all events any such adjustments which are
not required to be made by reason of this sentence (and which have not then been made) shall
be made immediately prior to conversion to Common Stock. Except to the limited extent
provided for in subsections (d)(i)(F)(3) and (d)(i)(F)(4) of this Section 4, no adjustment of such
Conversion Price pursuant to this subsection 4(d)(i) shall have the effect of increasing the
Conversion Price above the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment;
provided, however, that in no case shall the Conversion Price ever exceed the respective

SV\1320853,7
A0758791

applicable Conversion Price in effect as of the File Date except pursuant to the provisions of
subsection 4(d)(iv) hereof.

consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be

options to purchase either Additional Stock or convertible securities are issued or sold together
with other stock or securities or other assets of the Corporation for a consideration which covers
both, the consideration shall be computed as the portion of the consideration so received that
may be reasonably determined in good faith by the Corporation’s Board of Directors to be
allocable to such Additional Stock, convertible securities or rights or options. ,

(F) In the case of the issuance (whether before, on or
after the File Date) of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common Stock, securities by
their terms convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock or options to purchase or rights

a consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in
subsections 4(d)(i)(C) and 4(d)(i)(D)), if any, received by the Corporation upon the issuance of
such options or rights plus the minimum exercise price provided in such options or rights

(without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) for the Common Stock covered
thereby.

such convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof shall
be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or such options or rights

issuance of only the number of shares of Common Stock (and convertible or exchangeable
securities which remain in effect) actually issued upon the exercise of such options or rights,
upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or upon the exercise of the options or rights
related to such securities.

(m) Special Mandatory Conversion.

{i) In the event that a holder of shares of Series Preferred does

Qualified Financing, at least such holder’s Pro Rata Amount (as defined below) of the Offered
Securities (as defined below), then all of the shares of Series Preferred held by such holder shall
automatically, and without any further action on the part of such holder, be converted into shares
of Common Stock at the applicable Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the
consummation of such Qualified Financing, effective upon, subject to, and concurrently with, the
consummation of the Qualified Financing.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such holder participates in the
Qualified Financing but not to the full extent of such holder's Pro Rata Amount, then a
percentage of each series of Series Preferred held by such holder will be converted into Common
Stock (under the same terms as in the preceding sentence), with such percentage being equal to

the percent of such holder’s Pro Rata Amount that it failed to purchase in the Qualified
Financing.

For purposes of determining the number of shares of Series
Preferred owned by a holder, including in the definition of Pro Rata Amount, and for
determining the number of Offered Securities a holder of Series Preferred has purchased in a
Qualified Financing, all shares of Series Preferred held by Affiliates of such holder shall be
ageregated with such halder’s shares and all Offered Securities purchased by Affiliates of such
holder shall be aggregated with the Offered Securities purchased by such holder (provided that
no shares or securities shal! be attributed to more than one entity or person within any such group
of affiliated entities or persons). Upon such conversion (a “Special Mandatory Conversion”),
any shares of Series Preferred so converted shall be cancelled and not subject to reissuance.

shares of Series Preferred converted pursuant to Section 4(m){i) above shall surrender his, her or
its certificate or certificates for all such shares to the Corporation at the place designated in such
notice, and shall thereafter receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Section 4(m). All rights with respect to the Series
Preferred converted pursuant to Section 4(m)(i), including the rights, if any, to receive notices
and vote (other than as a holder of Common Stock), will terminate, except only the rights of the
holders thereof, upon surrender of their certificate or certificates therefor, to receive certificates
for the number of shares of Common Stock into which such Series Preferred has been converted,

certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by written instrument
or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the
registered holder or by his, her or its attorney duly authorized in writing. As soon as practicable
after the Special Mandatory Conversion and the surrender of the certificate or certificates for the
Series Preferred so converted, the Corporation shall cause to be issued and delivered to such
holder, or on his, her or its written order, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares
of Common Stock issuable on such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof and cash

All certificates evidencing shares of Series Preferred cancelled, and the shares of Series Preferred
converted pursuant to Section 4{m)(i) represented thereby shall, from and after the time of the
Special Mandatory Conversion, be deemed to have been converted into Common Stock for all
purposes, notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender such
certificates on or prior to such date. The Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate action
(without the need for stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number
of shares of Series Preferred or any series of Series Preferred accordingly.
