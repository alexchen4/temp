Law of Delaware.

ARTICLE IV

The Corporation is authorized to issue two classes of stock, designated “Common Stock”
and “Preferred Stock,” each with a par value of $0.0001 per share. The total number of shares
of Common Stock that the Corporation is authorized to issue is 36,220,610 shares. The total
number of shares of Preferred Stock that the Corporation is authorized to issue is 31,228,210
shares.

The Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series. The first
series of Preferred Stock shall comprised 9,088,785 shares and shall be designated “Series A
Preferred Stock.” The second series of Preferred Stock shall comprise 22,139,425 shares and

SF3137846.6 1
361438-9
shall be designated “Series A-2 Preferred Stock.” The relative rights, preferences, privileges and
restrictions granted to or imposed upon the Preferred Stock are as follows:

1. Dividends. The holders of the then outstanding Preferred Stock shall be entitled
to receive, when and as declared by the Board of Directors, out of assets legally available
therefor, prior and in preference to any declaration or payment of any dividend on the Common
Stock (payable other than in Common Stock or other securities or rights convertible into or
entitling the holder thereof to receive, directly or indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock),
dividends at the rate of $0.08 per annum for each share of Series A Preferred Stock, and $0.08
per annum for each share of Series A-2 Preferred Stock, each as adjusted for any stock splits,
reverse stock splits, combinations, stock dividends, recapitalizations and the like with respect to
such shares after the date on which this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation is
recorded as filed by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (each a “Recapitalization
Event’), No dividends shall be paid on any share of Series A Preferred Stock or Common Stock
unless a dividend (including the amount of any dividends paid pursuant to the above provisions
of this Section 1) is first paid with respect to all outstanding shares of Series A-2 Preferred Stock
in an amount for each such share of Series A-2 Preferred Stock equal to or greater than the
aggregate amount of such dividends for all shares of Common Stock into which each such share
of Series A-2 Preferred Stock could then be converted. The right to dividends on shares of
Preferred Stock shall not be cumulative, and no right shall accrue to holders of Preferred Stock
by reason of the fact that dividends on said shares are not declared in any period, nor shall any
undeclared or unpaid dividend bear or accrue interest. So long as any shares of Preferred Stock
are outstanding, the Corporation shall not pay or declare any dividend, whether in cash or
property, or make any other distribution on the Common Stock, or purchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire for value any shares of Common Stock until all dividends set forth above on
the Preferred Stock shall have been paid or declared and set apart.

2. Liquidation Preference. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up
of the Corporation, either voluntary or involuntary, the assets and funds of the Corporation
available for distribution to stockholders shall be distributed as follows:

(a) First, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series A-2
Preferred Stock then outstanding shall be entitled to receive, out of the assets of the Corporation
available for distribution to its stockholders, before any payment shall be made in respect of the
Corporation’s Common Stock, an amount equal to $1.00 per share of Series A Preferred Stock,
as adjusted for any Recapitalization Events (the “Original Series A Stock Price’’), and $1.00 per
share of Series A-2 Preferred Stock, as adjusted for any Recapitalization Events (the “Original
Series A-2 Stock Price), plus all declared and unpaid dividends thereon to the date fixed for such
distribution. [f, upon the occurrence of such event, the assets of the Corporation legally available
for distribution are insufficient to permit the payment to the holders of Preferred Stock of the full
preferential amount, then the entire assets available for distribution to stockholders shall be
distributed to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and Series A-2 Preferred Stock ratably in
proportion to the full preferential amounts which they would be entitled to receive pursuant to
the preceding sentence of this Section 2(a).

(b)  Affer the full preferential amounts due the holders of Preferred Stock
pursuant to Section 2(a) have been paid or set aside, the remaining assets of the Corporation

SF\3137846.6 2
361438-9
available for distribution to its stockholders, if any, shall be distributed on an as-converted basis
to the holders of Common Stock and Preferred Stock ratably in proportion to the number of
shares of Common Stock then held, or issuable upon conversion of the shares of Preferred Stock
then held, by each holder. .

(c) An “event of liquidation” shall include (i) a merger or consolidation of the
Corporation into or with another entity after which the stockholders of the Corporation
immediately prior to such transaction do not own, immediately following the consummation of
the transaction by virtue of their shares in the;Corporation or securities received in exchange for
such shares in connection with the transaction, a majority of the voting power of the surviving
entity in proportions substantially identical to’ those that existed immediately prior to such
transaction and with substantially the same rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions as the
shares they held immediately prior to the transaction (an “Acquisition”, (ii) the sale, transfer or
other disposition (but not including a transfer or disposition by pledge or mortgage to a bona fide
lender) of all or substantially all of the assets or intellectual property of the Corporation (other
than to a wholly-owned subsidiary) (a “Asset Transfer’), or (iii) the sale or transfer by the
Corporation or its stockholders of more than 50% of the voting power of the Corporation in a
transaction or series of related transactions other than in a transaction or series of transactions
effected by the Corporation primarily for financing purposes, in which cash is received by the
Corporation or any successor or indebtedness of the Corporation is cancelled or converted or a
combination thereof; and any such event shall be deemed to be a liquidation of the Corporation
as that term is used in this Section 2; provided, however, that the holders of at least sixty percent
(60%) of the Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class, may at any time in writing waive
treatment of any specific event as a liquidation,

(d) In the event of any liquidation of the Corporation involving the
distribution of assets other than cash to the stockholders of the Corporation, the value of the
assets to be distributed shall be determined as follows:

(i) In the case of securities that are not subject to investment letter or
other similar restrictions on free tradability,

(A) _ if traded on a national securities exchange or through the
Nasdaq Global Market, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the
securities over the 10 day period ending three days prior to the closing;

(B) if actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be
deemed to be the average of (i) the average of the last bid and ask prices or (ii) the closing sale
prices (whichever is applicable) over the 30 day period ending three days prior to the closing;
and

(C) _ if there is no active public market, the value shall be the
fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Corporation and the holders of at least a
majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock.

(ii) ‘In the case of securities subject to investment letter or other
restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of a

SF\3 137846.6 3
361438-9
stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate), the value shall be based on an appropriate
discount from the market value determined as above in Section 2(d)(i) to reflect the approximate
fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Corporation and the holders of at least a
majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock.

(iii) In the case of any other property, the value shall be equal to the
property’s fair market value, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation, including a majority of the directors elected by the holders of Preferred Stock
pursuant to Section 4(b) hereof.

3. Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as
follows:

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at
the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share, at the office
of the Corporation or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, into a number of fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock equal to the Original Series A Price, in the case of the
Series A Preferred Stock, or the Original Series A-2 Price, in the case of the Series A-2 Preferred
Stock, divided by the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock in effect at the time of
conversion. The Conversion Price for each of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series A-2
Preferred Stock shall initially be $1.00, and shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Section
3(d) below.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall
automatically be converted into fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock, at the
then effective Conversion Price, upon (i) the vote or written consent of at least sixty percent
(60%) of the voting power represented by the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock voting
together as a single class and on as as-converted basis or (ii) the closing of a firm commitment
underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement on Form S-1 (or a
successor form) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, covering the offer and sale of
Commor Stock at an offering price of not less than $3.00 per share, as adjusted for any
Recapitalization Event, with aggregate gross proceeds to the Corporation (prior to underwriters’
commissions and expenses) of not less than $45,000,000 (a “Qualified IPO”).

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the
certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the headquarters of the Corporation or of any
transfer agent for the Corporation and shall give written notice to the Corporation at such office
that the holder elects to convert the same and shall state therein the name or names in which the
certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued (except that no such
written notice of election to convert shall be necessary in the event of an automatic conversion
pursuant to Section 3(b) hereof). The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue
and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or nominees of
such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which he
shall be entitled as aforesaid. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately
prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be
converted (except that, in the case of an automatic conversion upon an initial public offering

SFG137846.6 4
361438-9
pursuant to Section 3(b), such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior
to the closing of the offering) and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common
Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or
holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date. Upon the occurrence of either of the
events specified in Section 3(b)(i) or (ii) above, the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall
be converted automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether
or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer
agent; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates
evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion unless either the
certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are delivered to the Corporation or its
transfer agent as provided above, or the holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that
such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the

Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against any loss incurred by it in connection with such
certificates.

event the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall issue
any Options or Convertible Securities or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders
of any class of securities entitled to receive any such Options or Convertible Securities, then the
following provisions shall apply:

(A) The maximum number of shares (as set forth in the
instrument relating thereto without regard to any provisions contained therein for a subsequent
adjustment of such number) of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Options or
upon the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities shall be deemed to be Additional
Shares of Common Stock issued as of the time of the issuance of such Option or Convertible
Security or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such
record date.

SF\3137846.6 6
361438-9
(B) — Except as provided in paragraphs (C) and (D) below, no
further adjustment in the Conversion Price shall be made upon the subsequent issue of
Convertible Securities or shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of such Options or
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities.

(C) Ifsuch Options or Convertible Securities by their terms
provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any change in the consideration payable to the
Corporation or the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or
exchange thereof (other than a change resulting from the antidilution provisions of such Options
or Convertible Securities), the Conversion Price computed upon the original issue thereof (or
upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto) and any subsequent adjustments based
thereon shall, upon any such increase or decrease becoming effective, be recomputed to reflect
such increase or decrease insofar as it affects such Options or the rights of conversion or
exchange under such Convertible Securities; provided, however, that such recomputed
Conversion Price shall not exceed the Conversion Price that would have been in effect had the
original issuance of Options or Convertible Securities not been deemed to constitute an issuance
of Additional Shares of Common Stock.

(D) Upon the expiration of any such Options or Convertible
Securities, the Conversion Price, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such
Options or Convertible Securities, shall be recomputed to reflect the issuance of only the number
of shares of Common Stock actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or Convertible
Securities.

(iii) Adjustment of Conversion Price for Dilutive Issuances.

(A) Series A-2 Preferred Stock. In the event the Corporation
shall sell and issue Additional Shares of Common Stock (including Additional Shares of
Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to Section 3(d)(ii)) after the Original Issue Date of
Series A-2 Preferred Stock for a consideration per share less than the Conversion Price for the
Series A-2 Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such issuance, then and in each such
event the Conversion Price for the Series A-2 Preferred Stock shall be adjusted as provided in
this Section 3(d)(iii)(A).

(1) Upon any issuance of Additional Shares of
Common Stock (including Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to
Section 3(d)(ii)), occurring before the Ratchet Elimination Date, the Conversion Price for the
Series A-2 Preferred Stock shall be reduced to the per share price paid for the Additional Shares
of Common Stock.

(2) Upon any issuance of Additional Shares of
Common Stock (including Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to
Section 3(d)(ii)), occurring on or after the Ratchet Elimination Date, the Conversion Price for the
Series A-2 Preferred Stock shall be reduced to a price (rounded to the nearest one tenth of one
cent) equal to such Conversion Price multiplied by a fraction:

$F\3137846.6 7
361438-9
(a) the numerator of which is equal to the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding or deemed to be outstanding immediately prior
to such issuance plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration
received by the Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so
issued would purchase at the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance; and

(b) the denominator of which is equal to the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding or deemed to be outstanding immediately prior
to such issuance plus the number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued.

(B) Series A Preferred Stock. In the event the Corporation
shall issue Additional Shares of Common Stock (including Additional Shares of Common Stock
deemed to be issued pursuant to Section 3(d)(ii)) after the Original Issue Date of the Series A
Preferred Stock without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Conversion
Price for the Series A Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such issuance, then and in
each such event the Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred Stock shall be reduced to a price
(rounded to the nearest one tenth of one cent) equal to such Conversion Price multiplied by a
fraction:

(1) the numerator of which is equal to the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding or deemed to be outstanding immediately prior to such
issuance plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration
received by the Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so
issued would purchase at the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance; and

(2) the denominator of which is equal to the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding or deemed to be outstanding immediately prior to such
issuance plus the number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued.

For the purposes of this Section 3(d)(iii), the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be
outstanding shall be deemed to include the Common Stock issuable upon full exercise and
conversion of all then outstanding Options and Convertible Securities, not including shares
excluded from the definition of ‘Additional Shares of Common Stock” pursuant to

Section 3(d)(i)(B)(2).

(iv) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this
Section 3(d), the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional
Shares of Common Stock shall be computed as follows:

(A) Cash and Property. Such consideration shall:

(1) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
aggregate amount of cash received by the Corporation before deducting any reasonable
discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the Corporation for any
underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof;

SF 137846.6 g
361438-9
(2) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors; and

-(3) inthe event Additional Shares of Common Stock
are issued together with other securities or other assets of the Corporation for consideration that
covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in
clauses (1) and (2) above, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(B) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration
per share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have
been issued pursuant to Section 3(d) relating to Options and Convertible Securities shall be equal
to:

(1) __ the total amount, if any, received or receivable by
the Corporation as consideration for the issuance of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus
the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments
relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of
such consideration) payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible
Securities, the exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, divided by

(2) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock
(as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein
for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities.

(v) Other Adjustments to Conversion Price.

(A) Subdivisions, Combinations or Consolidations of
Common Stock. In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided,
combined or consolidated, by stock split, reverse stock split or similar event, into a greater or
lesser number of shares of Common Stock after the Original Issue Date of a series of Preferred
Stock, the Conversion Price for such series in effect immediately prior to such subdivision,
combination or consolidation shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such subdivision,
combination or consolidation, be proportionately adjusted.

(B) Common Stock Dividends and Distributions. If, after
the Original Issue Date of a series of Preferred Stock, the Corporation at any time or from time to
time issues, or fixes a record date for determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to
receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock, then in
each such event, as of the time of such issuance or, in the event such record date is fixed, as of
the close of business on such record date, the Conversion Price for such series that is then in
effect shall be decreased by multiplying the Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction, (x) the
numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of business on such record date, and

SF\3137846.6 9
361438-9
(y) the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of business on such record date plus
the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution;
provided, however, that if such record date is fixed and such dividend or distribution is not paid
in full on the date fixed therefor, the Conversion Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the
close of business on such record date and thereafter the Conversion Price shall be adjusted
pursuant to this Section 3(d)(v)(B) to reflect the actual payment of such dividend or distribution.

(C) Other Distributions. In case the Corporation shall
distribute to holders of its Common Stock shares of its capital stock (other than shares of
Common Stock and other than as otherwise subject to adjustment pursuant to this Section 3(d)),
stock or other securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by the Corporation or
other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights (excluding options to
purchase and rights to subscribe for Common Stock or other securities of the Corporation
convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock), or shall fix a record date for determination
of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such a distribution, then, in each such case,
provision shall be made so that the holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, upon
conversion thereof, in addition to the number of shares of Common Stock receivable thereupon,
the amount of securities of the Corporation that they would have received had their Preferred
Stock been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event (or on the record date with
respect thereto, if such record date is fixed) and had they thereafter, during the period from the
date of such event to and including the date of conversion, retained such securities receivable by
them as aforesaid during such period, subject to all other adjustments called for during such
period tinder this Section 3 with respect to the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock.

(@) _—‘Recapitalizations and Reorganizations. In the case of
any capital recapitalization or reorganization (other than a subdivision, combination or other
recapitalization provided for elsewhere in this Section 3 or a merger or sale of assets provided for
in Section 2), or the fixing of any record date for determination of holders of Common Stock
affected by such recapitalization or reorganization, provision shall be made so that the holders of
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, upon conversion thereof, the type and number of
shares of stock or other securities or property of the Corporation or otherwise that they would
have received had their Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock on the date of such
event (or on the record date with respect thereto, if such record date is fixed) and had they
thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to and including the date of conversion,
retained such securities receivable by them as aforesaid during such period, subject to all other
adjustments called for during such period under this Section 3 with respect to the rights of the
holders of the Preferred Stock. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the
application of the provisions of this Section 3 to the end that the provisions of this Section 3 shall
be applicable after the recapitalization or reorganization to the greatest extent practicable.

(e) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment
or readjustment of the Conversion Price for a series of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 3,
the Corporation at its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in
accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to each holder of a share of such series of Preferred
Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts
upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based including the consideration received for

SF3137846.6
361438-9 10
any Additional Shares of Common Stock issued. The Corporation shall, upon the written request
at any time of any holder of a Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a
like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and readjustments, (ii) the Conversion Price at
the time in effect for the series of Preferred Stock held by such holder and (iii) the number of
shares of Common Stock and the type and amount, if any, of other property which at the time
would be received upon the conversion of a share of such series of Preferred Stock.

(f) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be
issued upon conversion of shares of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the
holder of Preferred Stock would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to
such fraction multiplied by the fair market value of one share of Common Stock as determined
by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. The number of whole shares issuable to each
holder of a series of Preferred Stock upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of
the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the total number of shares
of such series being converted into Common Stock by such holder at that time.

(g) Notices of Record Date. In the event (i) the Corporation shall take a
record of the holders of its capital stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend or
other distribution (other than a cash dividend) or to subscribe for or purchase any shares of stock
of any class or to receive any other rights, (ii) of any capital reorganization, reclassification or
recapitalization (other than a subdivision or combination of its outstanding shares of Common
Stock), or (iii) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the
Corporation or any transaction deemed to be a liquidation pursuant to Section 2, then, and in any
such case, the Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each holder of record of the Preferred
Stock at the address of record of such stockholder as set forth on the Corporation’s books, at
least 20 days prior to the earliest date hereinafter specified, a notice stating the material terms of
the proposed transaction and the date on which (x) a record is to be taken for the purpose of such
dividend, distribution or rights or (y) such reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization,
dissolution, liquidation or winding up is to take place and the date, if any is to be fixed, as of
which holders of capital stock of record shail be entitled to exchange their shares of capital stock
for securities or other property deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification,
recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or winding up; provided, however, that such notice
period may be shortened upon the written consent of holders of Preferred Stock that are entitled
to such notice rights or similar notice rights and that represent at least a majority of the voting .
power of all then outstanding shares of such Preferred Stock. If any material change in the facts
set forth in the written notice shall occur, the Corporation shall promptly give written notice of
such material change to each holder of shares of Preferred Stock.

(h) No Impairment. Without obtaining such consent of the holders of
Preferred Stock as may be required under Section 6, the Corporation will not, by amendment of
its Certificate of Incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation,
merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to
avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder
by the Corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the
provisions of this Section 3 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or
