Thirty-One Thousand Nine (5,731,009) shares, of which One Million Five Hundred Ferty-Nine
Thousand Seven Hundred Seventy-Five (1,549,775) shares shall be designated “Series A

and Four Million One Hundred Eighty-One Thousand Two Hundred Thirty-Four (4,181,234)
shares shall be designated “Series B Convertible Preferred Stock" (also referred to as “Series B
Stock” or "Series B Preferred Stock"). Except with respect to the Series A Stock and Series B
Stock, the Board of Directors of this Corporation (the "Board of Directors") is authorized to
determine the designation of any such series and to fix the number of shares of any such series.
The Board of Directors may determine or alter the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions
granted to or imposed upon any wholly unissued series of Preferred Stock. Except with respect
to the Series A Stock and Series B Stock, and within the limits and restrictions stated in any
resolution of resolutions of the Board of Directors originally fixing the number of shares
constituting any Series of Prefered Stock, the Board of Directors may increase or decrease (but
not below the number of shares of such series then outstanding) the number of shares of any such
series subsequent to the issue of shares of that series.

The rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the Common Stock, Series A Stock
and Series B Stock and of the holders thereof shall be as follows:

(a) DIVIDENDS.

(1) Series A Stock-Right to Dividends. Each holder of outstanding shares of
Series A Stock shall be entitled to receive, when and if declared by the Board of Directors but
only out of any assets legally available therefor, non-cumulative dividends in cash in an amount
equal to 5.0% of the per share Series A Issuance Price per annum (the "Series A Preferential
Dividend"), payable in any given fiscal year of this Corporation, in preference to any declaration
or payment (payable other than in Common Stock) to the Common Stock (but not without the
holders of Series B Stock also receiving the Series B Preferential Dividend (as defined below), as
adjusted pursuant to Article III (a)(3) below). The initial Series A Issuance Price is $2.258
(Appropriately Adjusted (as defined in Subsection (a)(6) below)).

(2) Series B Stock Right to Dividends. Each holder of outstanding shares of
Scries B Stock shall be entitled to receive, when and if declared by the Beard of Directors but
only out of any .ssets at the time legally available therefor, non-cumulative dividends in cash in
an amount equa! to 5.0% of the per share Series B Issuance Price per annum (the "Series B
Preferential Dividend"), payable in any given fiscal year of this Corporation, in preference to any
declaration or payment (payable other than in Common Stock) to the Common Stock (but not
without the holders of Series A Stock also receiving the Series A Preferential Dividend, as
adjusted pursuant to Article III (a)(3) below). The Series B Issuance Price is $0.4783276, as
Appropriately Adjusted from time to time.

(3) Partial Payment. If the Board of Directors shall declare a dividend on
the outstanding shares of Series A Stock and Series B Stock, and the amount available for
payment thereof is insufficient to permit the payment of the full preferential amounts required to
be paid to the holders of the outstanding shares of Series A Stock and Series B Stock, then the
amount available for such dividend payments shall be distributed ratably among the holders of
the outstanding shares of Series A Stock and the holders of the outstanding shares of Series B
Stock according to (i) the respective dividend preference amounts to which all such holders of
outstanding Series A Stock and Series B Stock would otherwise be entitled, and (ii) the number
of outstanding shares of each such series until each holder of outstanding shares of Series A
Stock has received its Series A Preferential Dividend and each holder of outstanding shares of
Series B Stock has received it Series B Preferential Dividend, as applicable, in full. For
example, assume that: (1) there are 1,549,775 shares of Series A Stock issued and outstanding,
and the Series A Preferential Dividend is $0.1129 per share; and (2) there are 4,181,234 shares of
Series B Stock issued and outstanding, and the Series B Preferential Dividend is $.0239 per
share; and (3) there is not enough money available for payment in full of the preferential

we wee =
dividends to the holders of the outstanding shares of Series A Stock and Series B Stock. In such
event, the Series A Stock shareholders would collectively be entitled to 63.65% of the dividend
to be paid; and the Series B Stock shareholders would collectively be entitled to 36.35% of the
dividend to be paid.

(4) Dividends After Payment of Preferential Dividends. After the holders
of record of the Series A Stock and Series B Stock have been paid their Preferential Dividends in

full, then the holders of record of Series A Stock, Series B Stock and Common Stock shall share
ratably in any additional dividends during such fiscal year on an as converted basis (i.e, the
number of sharcs of Common Stock which would be outstanding if the Series A Stock and Series
B Stock were converted to Common Stock). So long as any Series A Stock or Series B Stock
remains outstanding, no dividend shall be paid to the holders of record of Common Stock (other
than a dividend in shares of Common Stock) without the consent of the holders of record of a
majority of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock then outstanding
and voting as separate classes. Furthermore, no cash dividend may he paid on the Common
Stock so long as cash dividends previously or concurrently declared on the Series A Preferred
Stock or Series B Preferred Stock remain unpaid.

(5) Payment Other Than Cesh. If the Corporation shall declare a
distribution payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by the
Corporation or other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights to purchase
any such securities or evidences of indebtedness, then, in each such case, the holders of Series A
Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any
such distribution as though the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock
were the holders of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation into which their
respective shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock are convertible as of
the record date fixed for the determination of the holders of Common Stock of the Corporation
who are entitled to receive such distnbution.

(6) Dividend Adjustment. The Series A Preferential Dividend and Series B
Preferential Dividend amounts shall be appropriately adjusted for any stock dividends,
combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock
and Series B Preferred Stock. respectively (“Appropriately Adjusted”).

(b) PREFERENCE ON LIQUIDATION.

(1) Preference Price. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding
up of this Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary (a “Liquidation”), the holders of the
outstanding shares of Series A Stock and Series B Stock shall simultaneouzly be entitled to be
paid out of the assets of this Corporation available for distribution to its shareholders, whether
from capital, surplus funds or earnings, before any payment is made in respect of the shares of
Common Stock or other equity security of this Corporation of a lesser priority than the Series A
Stock and Series B Stock in an amount equal to (i) the Series A Issuance Price per share in the
case of the Series A Stock together with an amount equal to the greater of (A) five percent

(oy)
(5.0%) of the Series A Issuance Price compounded annually at the rate of 5.0%, for each year (or
fraction thereof) after December 30, 2004 (the "Series A Stock Issuance Date"), less the amount.
if any, of any dividends actually paid to the Series A Stock through the date of Liquidation, or
(B) any declared and unpaid dividends thereon (the “Series A Liquidation Preference Price");
and (ii) the Series B Issuance Price per share in the case of the Series B Stock together with an

which this Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation is filed with the California
Secretary of State (the “Series B Stock Issuance Date’), iess the amount, if any, of any dividends
actually paid to the Series B Stock through the date of Liquidation, or (B) any declared and
unpaid dividends thereon (the "Series B Liquidation Preference Price"). After payment of the
respective Liquidation Preference Prices to the holders of Series A Stock and Series B Stock, the
remaining assets of the Corporation shall be distributed to the holders of shares of Common
Stock, Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock in an equal amount per share as if
all Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock had been converted into Common
Stock as of the date of the Liquidation.

(2) Partial Payment. If, upon Liquidation, the assets of this Corporation
available for distribution to its shareholders shall be insufficient to pay the full Liquidation
Preference Prices required to be paid to the holders of the outstanding shares of Series A Stock

shares, at the office of this Corporation or any transfer agent for the Corporation's shares into that
number of shares of Common Stock which is equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the
Series A Issuance Price for each share of Series A Stock and the Series B Issuance Price for each
share of Series B Stock by (B) the "Series A Conversion Price” and “Series B Conversion Price,"
respectively, (as such terms are hereinafter defined) in effect immediately prior to the time of
such conversion. The conversion price at which shares of Common Stock will be deliverable
upon the conversion of a share of Series A Stock without the payment of additional consideration
by the holder thereof (the “Series A Conversion Price”) shall initially be the Series A Issuance
Price; provided, however, that the Series A Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment from
time to time as herein provided. The conversion price at which shares of Common Stock will be

of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled and shall promptly pay all declared but unpaid
dividends on the shares being converted. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made
immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the certificate or
certificates representing the shares to be converted, and the person entitled to receive the shares
of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for ali purposes as the record
holder of such shares of Common Stock on such date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
conversion is in connection with a Liquidation, Qualified IPO (as defined in Subsection
(dX11)(1) below) or the pubiic registration of the Corporation’s securities under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), the conversion may, at the option of any holder
tendering Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned
upon the closing of such transaction or series of related transactions, in which event the person(s)
entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock
or Series B Preferred Stock, as the case may be, shall not be deemed to have converted such
Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the final closing

any time or from time to time after the Series B Stock Issuance Date effects a division of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Series A Conversion Price and the Series B
Conversion Price shall be proportionately decreased and, conversely, if this Corporation at any
time, or from time to time, after the Series B Stock Issuance Date combines the outstanding
shares of Common Stock, the Series A Conversion Price and the Series B Conversion Price shall
be proportionately increased. Any adjustment under this Section (d)(3) shall be effective on the
close of business on the date such division or combination becomes effective.

a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Common Stock entitled to receive a
dividend or other distribution in the form of shares of Common Stock, or nights or options for the
purchase of, or securities convertible into, Common Stock, then in each such event the Series A
Conversion Price and the Series B Conversion Price shall be decreased, as of the time of such
payment or, in the event a record date is fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, by
multiplying the Series A Conversion Price and the Series B Conversion Price by a fraction (i) the
numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the time of such payment or the close of business on such record date and
(ii) the denominator of which shall be (A) the total number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the time of such payment or the close of business on such
record date plus (B) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such
dividend or distribution or upon exercise of such option or right of conversion; provided,
however, that if a record date is fixed and such dividend is not fully paid or such other
distribution is not tully made on the date fixed therefor, the Series A Conversion Price and the
Series B Conversion Price shall not be decreased as of the close of business on such record date
as hereinabove provided as to the portion not fully paid or distributed and thereafter the Series A
Conversion Price and the Series B Conversion Price shall be decreased pursuant to this
Section (4) as of the date or dates of actual payment of such dividend or distribution.

(5) Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. If this
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Series B Stock Issuance Date pays, or
fixes a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Common Stock entitled to
receive, a dividend or other distribution in the form of securities of this Corporation other than
shares of Common Stock or rights or options for the purchase of, or securities convertible into,
Common Stock, then in each such event provision shali be made so that the holders of the
outstanding shares of Series A Stock and the holders of the outstanding shares of Series B Stock
shall receive upon conversion thereof, in addition to the number of shares of Common Stock
receivable thereupon, the amount of securities of this Corporation which they would have
received had their respective shares of Series A Stock and Series B Stock been converted into
shares of Common Stock on the date of such event and had such holders thereafter, from the date
of such event to and including the actual date of conversion of their shares, retained such
securities, subject to all other adjustments called for during such period under this Section (d)
with respect to the nghts of the holders of the outstanding shares of Series A Stock and the
holders of the outstanding shares of Series B Stock.

(6) Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. If, at any

time or from time to time after the Series B Stock Issuance Date. the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the shares of Series A Stock and Series B Stock is

other securities, whether by recapitalization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a
recapitalization, division or combination of shares or stock dividend or a reorganization, merger,
consolidation or sale of assets provided for elsewhere in this Section (d)), then, in any such
event, each holder of outstanding shares of Series A Stock and each holder of outstanding shares
of Series B Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such shares of Series A Stock and
Series B Stock into the same kind and amount of stock and other securities receivable upon such
recapitalization, reclassification or other change, as the maximum number of shares of Common
Stock into which such shares of Series A Stock and Sencs B Stock could have been converted
immediately prior to such recapitalization, reclassification or change, all subject to further
adjustment as provided herein.

(7) Reorganizations, Mergers, Consolidations or Sales of Assets. If, at any

time or from time to time after the Series B Stock Issuance Date, there is a capital reorganization
of the Common Stock (other than a recapitalization, division, combination, reclassification or
exchange of shares provided for elsewhere in this Section (d)) or a merger or consolidation of
this Corporation into or with another corporation or a sale of all or substantially all of this
Corporation's properties and assets to any other person, then, as a part of such capital
reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale, provision shall be made so that the holders of the
outstanding shares of Series A Stock and the holders of the outstanding shares of Series B Stock
shall thereafter receive upon conversion thereof the number of shares of stock or other securities
or property of this Corporation, or of the successor corporation resulting from such merger or
consolidation or sale, to which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which
their shares of Series A Stock and Series B Stock were convertible would have been entitled on
such capital reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale. In any such case, appropriate
adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section (d) with respect to
the rights of the holders of the outstanding shares of Series A Stock and Series B Stock after the
capital reorganization. merger, consolidation, or sale to the end that the provisions of this Section
(d) (including adjustment of the Series A Conversion Price and Series B Conversion Price and
the number of shares into which the shares of Series A Stock and Series B Stock may be
converted) shall be applicable after that event and be as nearly equivalent to such Conversion
Prices and number of shares as may be practicable.

(8) Sale of Shares Below Conversion Price.

(i) If, at any time or from time to time after the Series A Stock
Issuance Date, this Corporation issues or sells, or is deemed by the express provisions of this
Subsection (d8) to have issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock (as hereinafter
defined in Clause (iv) below)) for an Effective Price (as hereinafter defined at the end of this
paragraph) less than the then current Series A Conversion Price or Series B Conversion Price,
then, in any such event, the Series A Conversion Price (if the Effective Price is less than the then
current Series A Conversion Price), or the Series B Conversion Price (if the Effective Price is
less than the then current Series B Conversion Price), or both (if the Effective Price is less than
both the then current Series A Conversion Price and the Series B Conversion Price) shall be
reduced, as of the close of business on the date of such issuance or sale, to an amount determined
by multiplying the then current Series A Conversion Price or Series B Conversion Price, or both,
as applicable, by a fraction (A) the numerator of which shall be (x) the number of shares of
Common Siock outstanding at the close of business on the day immediately preceding the date of
such issuance or sale, plus (y) the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate
consideration received (or by the express provisions hereof deemed to have been received) by
this Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of Common Siock so issued or sold
would purchase at such then current Series A Conversion Price or Series B Conversion Price, or
both, as applicable, and (B) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of such Additional Shares
of Common Siock so issued. For the purpose of the above calculation, the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance shall be calculated on a fully
diluted basis, as if all Convertible Securities (as defined below) bearing a conversion price which
is lower than the price at which the Additional Shares of Common Stock were issued (except for
Series A Stock and Series B Stock, which shall be deemed converted regardless of their
Conversion Price) had been fully converted into shares of Common Stock and anv vutstanding
Options (as defined below) bearing an exercise price which is lower than the price at which the
Additional Shares of Common Stock were issued had been fully cxercised (and the resulting
securities fully converted into shares of Common Stock, if so convertible) as of such date.
"Convertible Securities" means any evidences of indebtedness, shares (other than Common
Stock) or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock, and “Options”
means rights, options or warrants to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire either Common
Stock or Convertible Securities. The "Effective Price" of Additional Shares of Common Stock
shall mean the quotient obtained by dividing the total number of Additional Shares of Common
Stock issued or sold, or deemed to have been issued or sold, under this Section (8) into the
aggregate consideration received, or deemed to have been received for such Additional Shares of
Common Stock.
(ii) For the purpose of making any adjustnsent required under this
Subsection (d)(8). the consideration received by this Corporation for aay issuance of securit.es
shall (A) to the extent it consists of property other than cash, be the fair value of that property as
reasonably deiermined in accordance with the procedures set forth in Subsection (b)( 4K iil) above
in the event of a Liquidation: and (B) if Additional Shares of Common Stock, Convertible
Securities or Options are issued together with other stock or securities or other assets of this
Corporation for a considerauon which covers both, be the portion of 'he consideratior so
received reasonably determined by the Board of Directors to be allocable to such Additional
Shares of Comimon Stock, Convertible Securities or Options. Where the Corporation rece: es no
consideration per share, the Corporation shall nonetheless be deemed to have received

Subsection (d)(8).

exercise of such Options or, in the case of Convertible Secunties, the minimum amount of
consideration, if any, payable to this Corporation upon the conversion thereof. Thereafie-, no
further adjustment of the Series A Conversion Price or Series B Conversion Price shall be raade
as a result of the actual issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock on the exercise of any
such Options or the conversion of any such Convertible Securities. If any such Options o° the
conversion privilege represented by any such Convertitle Secunties shall expire or other vise
terminate without having been exercised, the Series A Conversion Price or Series B Conversion
Price, or both, as applicable, shall thereafter be the Series A Conversion Price or Series B
Conversion Price, or both, as applicable, which would have been in effect had an adjustment
been made on the basis that the only Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued were the
Additional Shares of Common Stock, if any, actually issued or sold on the exercise of such
Options or nghts of conversion of such Convertible Securities, and were issued or sold for the
consideration actually received by this Corporation upon such exercise plus (A) the
consideration, if any, actually recerved for the granting of all such rights or options, whethe- or
not exercised, (B) the consideration, if any, actually received by issuing or selling the
Convertible Securities actually converted and (C) the consideration, if any, actually received on
the conversion of such Convertible Securities. However, if any such Options or Convertible
Securities by their terms provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any increase in the
consideration payable to the Corporation, upon the exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, the
Conversion Price for the Series A Stock and Serivs B Stock, and any subsequent adjustments
based thereon, shall upon any such increase or decrease becoming effective be recomputed to
reflect such increase or decrease insofar as it affects such Options or the rights of conversion or
exchange under such Convertible Secunties.

(iv) For the purpose of the adjustment required under this Subsection (d}(8). if
this Corporation issues any Options to purchase Convertible Securities, this Corporation shall be
deemed to have issued, at the time of the issuance of such Options, Additional Shares of
Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the
total number of Convertible Securities covered by such Options (as set forth in the legal
instruments setting forth the terms of such Convertible Securities) and to have received as
consideration therefor an amount equal to the amount of consideration, if any, received for the
issuance of such Options plus (A) the minimum amount of consideration, if any, payable upon
the exercise of such Options and (B) the minimum amount of consideration, if any, payable upon
the conversion of such Convertible Securities. No further adjustment of the Series A Conversion
Price or Series B Conversion Price, as applicable, shall be made as a result of the actual issuance
of the Convertible Securities upon the exercise of such Options or upon the actual issuance of
shares of Common Stock upon the conversion of such Convertible Securities. The provisions of
Subsection (d8 iii) for the adjustment of the Series A Conversion Price or Series B Conversion
Price, as applicable, upon the expiration of Options or the rights of conversion of Convertible
Securities shall apply mutatis mutandis upon the expiration of the Options and Convertible
Securities referred to in this Clause (iv).

Common Stock" shall mean all shares of Common Stock issued or deemed to be issued under
