LEGALREY, INC.

ARTICLE I - NAME

ARTICLE II - CAPITALIZATION
A. Classes and Series of Stock
1. Reverse Stock Split }

(a) At the initial date and time of the effectiveness of these Amended and
Restated Articles of Incorporation (the "Effective Time"), each share of Common Stock (as
defined below) of the Corporation issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be changed and reclassified into one half (1/2) of one share of Common Stock
(the "Reverse Stock Split").

(b) — The Reverse Stock Split shal! occur automatically without any further action
by the holders of the shares affected thereby and whether or not the certificates representing
such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent. The Reverse Stock Split
shall be effected on a record holder-by-record holder basis, such that all fractional shares
resulting from the Reverse Stock Split of a given record holder's Common Stock shall be
aggregated. After aggregating fractional shares in accordance with the previous sentence, no
remaining fractional share of Common Stock shall be issued as a result of the Reverse Stock
Split. In lieu of any fractional share to which a record holder would otherwise be entitled,
the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair market value of
one share of Common Stock as determined in good faith by the Corporation's Board of
Directors (the "Board").

(c) Section (A)(2), below, of this Article II sets forth the total authorized capital
stock of the Corporation after giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split. The rights,
preferences and privileges of the Common Stock and Preferred Stock (as defined below) as
set forth herein have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split (that is, all numeric
references and other provisions included in these Amended and Restated Articles of
Incorporation have already given effect to, and no further adjustment shall be made on
account of, the Reverse Stock Split).

Incorporation,

1, Dividends

When, as and if declared by the Board the holders of shares of Series A Preferred
shall be entitled to receive dividends out of any assets legally available therefor, prior and in
preference to any declaration or payment of any dividend (other than dividends payable in
Common Stock or other securities and rights convertible into or entitling the holder thereof to
receive, directly or indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock of the Corporation,
provided that an adjustment to the Series A Conversion Price (as defined below) has been
made in accordance with Section 3(d)(ii) below) on the Common Stock of the Corporation, at
the rate of $0.03695 per share per annum on each outstanding share of Series A Preferred
(subject to proportional adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split,
combinations, recapitalization, reclassification or other similar event affecting such shares),
Such dividends shall not be cumulative, and no right thereto shall accrue if such dividends
are not declared, After satisfaction of the foregoing dividend preference, the Series A
Preferred shall be entitled to share, on an as converted to Common Stock basis, in any
dividend declared and paid with respect to the Common Stock. For the purpose of
determining the legality of distributions pursuant to Section 23B,06.400(2)(b) of the Revised
Code of Washington, or any successor statute, repurchases or redemptions of Common Stock

set forth in Section 2 below,

2. Liquidation
(a) _ Priority of Payments

Upon a Liquidation Event (as defined below), the assets and funds legally available
for distribution to shareholders of the Corporation ("Distributable Proceeds") shall be
distributed as follows:

[61016-0002/8 B06 | 250,007}

(i) The holders of shares of Series A Preferred then outstanding shall be
entitled to be paid out of the Distributable Proceeds, before any payment is made to the
holders of Common Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount equal to $0.4619
per share of Series A Preferred (subject to proportional adjustment in the event of any stock
dividend, stock split, combination, recapitalization, reclassification or other similar event
with respect to the Series A Preferred) (the "Series A Liquidation Amount") plus any
declared but unpaid dividends on such shares of Series A Preferred, If, upon any such
Liquidation Event, the Distributable Proceeds are insufficient to pay the holders of Series A
Preferred the full amount of the Series A Liquidation Amount plus any declared but unpaid
dividends thereon, then all Distributable Proceeds shall be distributed ratably among the
holders of Series A Preferred in proportion to the preferential amount each such holder
otherwise would have been entitled to receive.

(ii) | Upon the completion of the distributions to the holders of Series A
Preferred as described above, the remaining Distributable Proceeds shall be distributed
among the holders of Common Stock pro rata based on the number of shares of Common
Stock held by each. Nothing contained in this Section 2 shall limit the right of holders of
Series A Preferred to convert their shares into Common Stock at any time prior to or
simultaneously with the closing of a Liquidation Event, provided that shares of Series A
Preferred shall not be entitled to be converted into shares of Common Stock in order to
participate in any Liquidation Event, or series of Liquidation Events, as shares of Common
Stock, without first foregoing participation in the Liquidation Event, or series of Liquidation
Events, as shares of Series A Preferred,

(b) Liquidation Events

(i) Definition. For purposes of this Section 2, a "Liquidation Event"
shall mean: (A) the closing of the sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially al!
of the Corporation's assets (including an exclusive license with respect to all or substantially
all of the Corporation’s intellectual property); (B) the consummation of a merger, share
exchange or consolidation of the Corporation with or into another entity (except one in which
the holders of capital stock of the Corporation as constituted immediately prior to such
merger, share exchange or consolidation continue to hold at least 50% of the voting power of
the capital stock of the Corporation or the surviving or acquiring entity (or its parent entity));
or (C) a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation (whether voluntary or
involuntary). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) a transaction under (3) of the prior
sentence shall not constitute a Liquidation Event if its purpose is (x) to change the state of the
Corporation's incorporation, or (y) to create a holding company that will be owned in
substantially the same proportions by the persons who held the Corporation's securities
immediately prior to such transaction; and (2) any transaction or event otherwise constituting
a Liquidation Event under this paragraph shall be deemed to be exempt from such definition
if (x) the holders of a majority of the then outstanding Series A Preferred so agree by vote or
written consent or (y) the Board (including at least one Series A Director, as defined below)
specifically approves the transaction or event as an exempt transaction or event from the
definition of a Liquidation Event.

a
[61016-0002/513061250.007)

(ii) Valuation of Consideration. If the consideration received ina
Liquidation Event is other than cash, its value will be deemed its fair market value as
determined in good faith by the Board. Any securities shall be valued as follows:

(A) — Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar
restrictions on free marketability:

(1) ‘If traded on a securities exchange or the Nasdaq
National Market, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the
securities on such exchange over the twenty trading-day period ending on the third trading
day prior to the closing;

(2) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the
twenty trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to the closing; and

(3) If there is no active public market, the value shall be the
fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Corporation and the holders of at
least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock.

(B) The method of valuation of securities subject to investment
letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by
virtue of a shareholder's status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an
appropriate discount from the market value determined as above in Section 2(b)(ii)(A) to
reflect the approximate fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board.

3. Conversion

The holders of the Series A Preferred shal! have the right to convert their shares of
Preferred Stock into Common Stock as provided in this Section 3.

(a) Voluntary Conversion

Subject to Section 3(c), each share of Series A Preferred shall be convertible,
at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share, at the
office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for such stock, into such number of fully paid
and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Series A
Liquidation Amount by the Series A Conversion Price (as defined below) in effect on the
effective date of such conversion, as determined below. The initial Series A Conversion
Price shall be equal to the Series A Liquidation Amount (the "Series A Conversion Price").
Such initial Series A Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in
Section 3(d).

(61016-0002/SB06 1250.007}

(b) Automatic Conversion

Each share of Series A Preferred shall automatically be converted into shares of
Common Stock at the Series A Conversion Price at the time in effect for such share
immediately upon the earlier of (i) the date specified by the affirmative vote or consent of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred, and (ii) the effective
date of the registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act"), with respect to an underwritten public offering of the Corporation's
Common Stock in which the public offering price results in gross proceeds to the
Corporation of at least $30,000,000 (a "Qualified Public Offering").

(c) Mechanics of Conversion

Before any holder of Series A Preferred shall be entitled to convert such shares into
shares of Common Stock under Section 3{a) above, such holder shall (i) (A) surrender the
certificate or certificates for the shares to be converted, duly endorsed, at the office of the
Corporation or of any transfer agent for such series of Preferred Stock, or (B) notify the
Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and
execute an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any
loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates, and (ii) give written notice to the
Corporation at its principal corporate office of the election to convert such shares and shall
state therein the name or names in which the certificate or certificates for the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion are to be issued. The Corporation shall, as
soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred
Stock, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the
number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled upon such
conversion. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the
close of business on the date on which the requirements of the first sentence of this paragraph
have been satisfied with respect to the shares of such series of Preferred Stock to be
converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable
upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such
shares of Common Stock as of such date. In connection with any automatic conversion of
Preferred Stock under Section 3(b) above, such conversion shall be deemed effective with
respect to all shares of such Preferred Stock so converted as of the effective date of the vote
or consent referred to in clause (i) of such subsection or the effective date of the Qualitied
Public Offering registration statement referred to in clause (ii) of such subsection; provided,
however, that if the automatic conversion is in connection with a Qualified Public Offering,
the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering such Preferred Stock for
conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of securities
pursuant to such Qualified Public Offering, in which event the person(s) entitled to receive
the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such Preferred Stock shall not be
deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such
sale of securities, The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after the effective date of any
automatic conversion, issue and deliver, at the Corporation's principal corporate office, to
each holder of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or

-5-
[61016-0002/SB061256.007]

certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled
upon such conversion, subject to any such holder first providing to the Corporation the
documentation referred to in clauses (i)(A) or (i)(B) of this paragraph. The person or persons
entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be
treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock as of
the effective date of conversion as provided above.

(d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock for Certain
Dilutive Issuances, Splits and Combinations

The Series A Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as
follows:

(i) Issuance of Additional Stock below Purchase Price. If the
Corporation shall issue, after the first issuance of shares of Series A Preferred (the "Series A
Purchase Date"), any Additional Stock (as defined below) for a consideration per share less
than the Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such
Additional Stock, then, in each such case, the applicable Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such issuance shall automatically be adjusted as set forth in this
Section 3(d)(i), unless otherwise provided in this Section 3(d)(i).

(A) Adjustment Formula. Whenever the Series A Conversion
Price is adjusted pursuant to this Section 3(d)(i), the new applicable Conversion Price shall
be determined by multiplying the applicable Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to
the issuance of Additional Stock by a fraction, (x) the numerator of which shall be the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (or deemed to be outstanding pursuant to
Section 3(d)(i)(E) below) immediately prior to such issuance (the "Outstanding Common")
plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received by the
Corporation for such issuance would purchase at such Conversion Price; and (y) the
denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Outstanding Common plus the
number of shares of such Additional Stock.

(B) Definition of Additional Stock. For purposes of this
Section 3(d)(i), "Additional Stock" shall mean any shares of Common Stock issued (or
deemed to have been issued pursuant to Section 3(d)(i)(E)) by the Corporation after the
Series A Purchase Date, other than:

(1) Common Stock issued pursuant to a transaction
described in Section 3(d)(ii) hereof;

(2) Capital stock, or warrants or options to purchase capital
stock, issued to employees, directors, consultants or other service providers of the
Corporation pursuant to a stock option plan or other compensatory agreements or
arrangements approved by the Board;

-6-
[6101 6-0002/SB061250.007)

(3) Capital stock, or warrants or options to purchase capital
stock, issued in connection with bona fide acquisitions, mergers or similar transactions;

(4) Capital stock, or options or warrants to purchase capital
stock, issued in connection with commercial credit arrangements, equipment financings, or
similar transactions, plans or arrangements, provided that such transactions, plans or
arrangements are effected primarily for purposes other than raising equity capital;

(5) | Common Stock issued or issuable upon conversion of
the Series A Preferred;

(6) | Common Stock issued or issuable in a Qualified Public
Offering;

(7) Capital stock issued or issuable upon exercise of
options, warrants or convertible notes of the Corporation outstanding as of the Series A
Purchase Date; or

(8) Capital stock, or options or warrants to purchase capital
stock, issued in connection with strategic collaborations, development agreements, licensing
transactions or similar transactions, plans or arrangements, provided that such transactions,
plans or arrangements are effected primarily for purposes other than raising equity capital.

(C) No Fractional Adjustments. No adjustment of the Series A
Conversion Price shall be made in an amount less than one hundredth of a cent per share,
provided that any adjustments which are not required to be made by reason of this sentence
shall be carried forward and shal! be either taken into account in any subsequent adjustment
made prior to three years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being
carried forward, or shall be made at the end of three years from the date of the event giving
rise to the adjustment being carried forward.

(D) Determination of Consideration. In the case of the issuance
of Common Stock for cash, the consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid
therefor before deducting any reasonable discounts, commissions, compensations or
concessions allowed, paid or incurred by the Corporation for any underwriting or otherwise
in connection with the issuance and sale thereof and without deductions of any other
expenses paid by the Corporation. In the case of the issuance of Common Stock fora
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be
deemed to be the fair value thereof as determined in good faith by the Board irrespective of
any accounting treatment.

(E) Deemed Issuances of Common Stock. In the case of the
issuance of options or warrants to purchase, or other rights to subscribe for, shares of
Common Stock, securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for Common
Stock, or options or warrants to purchase, or other rights to subscribe for, such convertible or

[6101 6-0002/SB06 | 250.007]
exchangeable securities, the following provisions shall apply for all purposes of this
Section 3(d)(i):

(1) The aggregate maximum number of shares of Common
Stock deliverable upon exercise (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to exercisability,
including without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account potential
antidilution adjustments) of such options or warrants to purchase, or other rights to subscribe
for, Common Stock shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such options, warrants or
rights were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the
manner provided in Section 3(d){i)(D)), if any, received by the Corporation upon the
issuance of such options, warrants or rights plus the minimum exercise price provided in
such options, warrants or rights (without taking into account potential antidilution
adjustments) for the Common Stock covered thereby.

(2) The aggregate maximum number of shares of Common
Stock deliverable upon conversion of or in exchange (assuming the satisfaction of any
conditions to convertibility or exchangeability, including, without limitation, the passage of
time, but without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) for any such
convertible or exchangeable securities, or upon the exercise of options or warrants to
purchase, or other rights to subscribe for, such convertible or exchangeable securities and
subsequent conversion or exchange thereof shall be deemed to have been issued at the time
such securities were issued or such options, warrants or rights were issued and for a
consideration equal to the consideration, if any, received by the Corporation for any such
securities and related options, warrants or rights (excluding any cash received on account of
accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the minimum additional consideration, if any, to
be received by the Corporation (without taking into account potential antidilution
adjustments) upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or the exercise of any
related options, warrants or rights (the consideration in each case to be determined in the
manner provided in Section 3(d)(i)(D)).

(3) Inthe event of any change in the number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon exercise
of such options, warrants or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such convertible
or exchangeable securities, including without limitation a change resulting from the
antidilution provisions thereof, the Series A Conversion Price, to the extent in any way
affected by or computed using such options, warrants, rights or securities, shall be
recomputed to reflect such change, but no further adjustment shall be made for the actual
issuance of Common Stock or any payment of such consideration upon the exercise of any
such options, warrants or rights or the conversion or exchange of such securities.

(4) Upon the expiration of any such options, warrants or
rights, the termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any
options, warrants or rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the
Series A Conversion Price, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such
options, warrants, rights or securities or options, warrants or rights related to such securities,

-8-
[61016-0002/S8061 250.007]

shal] be recomputed to reflect the issuance of only the number of shares of Common Stock
(and convertible or exchangeable securities which remain in effect) actually issued upon the
exercise of such options, warrants or rights, upon the conversion or exchange of such
securities or upon the exercise of the options, warrants or rights related to such securities,

. (5) The number of shares of Common Stock deemed issued
and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to Sections 3(d)(i)(E)(1) and
3(d)(i)(EX(2) shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or expiration
of the type described in either Section 3(d)(i)(E)(3) or 3(d)(i)(E)(4).

(F) No Increased Conversion Price. Notwithstanding any other
provisions of this Section 3(d)(i), except to the limited extent provided for in
Sections 3(d)(i)(E}(3) and 3(d)(i)(E)(4), no adjustment of the Series A Conversion Price
pursuant to this Section 3(d)(i) shall have the effect of increasing any such Conversion Price,

(G) Waiver of Adjustment. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, any downward adjustment of the Series A Conversion Price may be waived,
either prospectively or retroactively and either generally or in a particular instance, by the
consent or vote of either (1) the holders of the majority of the outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred, or (2) the Board (including at least one Series A Director). Any such waiver shall
bind all future holders of shares of Series A Preferred.

(ii) Stock Splits and Dividends. In the event the Corporation should at
any time or from time to time after the Series A Purchase Date fix a record date for the
effectuation of a split or subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or the
determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive a dividend or other
distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock or other securities or rights
convertible into, or entitling the holder thereof to receive directly or indirectly, additional
shares of Common Stock (hereinafter referred to as "Common Stock Equivalents") without
payment of any consideration by such holder for the additional shares of Common Stock or
the Common Stock Equivalents (including the additional shares of Common Stock issuable
upon conversion or exercise thereof), then, as of such record date (or the date of such
dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no record date is fixed), the Series A Conversion
Price shall be appropriately decreased so that the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable on conversion of each share of Series A Preferred shall be increased in proportion to
such increase of the aggregate of shares of Common Stock outstanding and shares issuable
with respect to Common Stock Equivalents, with the number of shares issuable with respect
to Common Stock Equivalents determined from time to time in the manner provided for
deemed issuances in Section 3{d)(i)(E).

(iii) Reverse Steck Splits, If the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding at any time after the Series A Purchase Date is decreased by a reverse split or
combination of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, then, following the record date of
such reverse split or combination, the Series A Conversion Price shail be appropriately
increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each

[61016-0002/SB06 | 250.007]

share of Series A Preferred shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding
shares of Common Stock.

(e) Other Distributions

Subject to Section | above, in the event the Corporation shall declare a distribution
payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by the Corporation or
other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options, warrants or rights not referred to
in Section 3(d)(ii), then, in each such case for the purpose of this Section 3(e), the holders of
each series of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any such
distribution as though they were the holders of the number of shares of Common Stock of the
Corporation into which their shares of Preferred Stock are convertible as of the record date
fixed for the determination of the holders of Common Stock of the Corporation entitled to
receive such distribution.

(f)  Recapitalizations

If at any time or from time to time there shall be a recapitalization of the Common
Stock (other than a subdivision, combination or merger or sale of assets transaction provided
for elsewhere in this Section 3 or in Section 2), provision shall be made so that the holders of
the Series A Preferred shall thereafter be entitled to receive, upon conversion of such
Preferred Stock, the number of shares of capital stock or other securities or property of the
Corporation (or otherwise) to which a holder of the Common Stock deliverable upon
conversion of such Preferred Stock would have been entitled on such recapitalization if such
Common Stock had been outstanding at the time of such transaction. In any such case,
appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 3
with respect to the rights of the holders of such Preferred Stock after the recapitalization to
the end that the provisions of this Section 3 (including adjustment of the Series A Conversion
Price then in effect and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of such Preferred
Stock) shall be applicable after that event and be as nearly equivalent as practicable.

(g) No Fractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments

(i) ~ No fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of any share
or shares of Preferred Stock, and the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued shall
be rounded to the nearest whole share. With respect to any fraction of a share called for upon
the conversion of Series A Preferred, an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the then
current Series A Conversion Price, as applicable, shall be paid in cash to the holder otherwise
entitled to receive such fractional shares, unless such payment is waived by the holders of'a
majority of the outstanding Preferred Stock (at a meeting or by written consent), The number
of shares issuable to each holder upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of
the total number of shares of Series A Preferred that the holder is at the time converting into
Common Stock and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such aggregate
conversion.

-10-
(61016-0002/$B061250.007)

(ii) | Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the
Series A Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 3, the Corporation, at its expense, shall
promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and
prepare and furnish to each holder of such Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such
adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or
readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any
holder of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate
setting forth (A) such adjustment and readjustment, (B) the Series A Conversion Price at the
time in effect, and (C) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of
other property which at the time would be received upon the conversion of a share of Series
A Preferred.

(bh) —_— Reservation of Stock Issuable upon Conversion

The Corporation shal] at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but
unissued shares of Common Stock, sotely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the
shares of the Series A Preferred, such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from
time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of the outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred. {f at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock
shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred, the Corporation shall take such corporate action as may be necessary to increase
its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be
sufficient for such purposes, including without limitation engaging in reasonable efforts to
obtain the requisite shareholder approval of any necessary amendment to the Corporation's
Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, ,

(i) Status of Converted or Repu rehased Stock

In the event any shares of Series A Preferred shall be converted pursuant to Section 3
hereof, or otherwise redeemed, purchased or acquired by the Corporation, the shares so
converted, redeemed, repurchased or acquired shall be canceled and cease to be authorized
and shall not be re-issuable by the Corporation,

(j) No Impairment

reorganization, recapitalization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or
sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or
performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Corporation,
but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Section
3 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect
the conversion rights of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock against impairment.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 3(j) shall prohibit the Corporation
from amending its Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation with the requisite
consent of the Board and the Corporation's shareholders as set forth in Section 4 below.

[61016-0002/SB061250.007]

Time shall be changed and reclassified into one half (1/2) of one share of Common Stock
(the "Reverse Stock Split").

(b) The Reverse Stock Split shall occur automatically without any further action
by the holders of the shares affected thereby and whether or not the certificates representing
such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent. The Reverse Stock Split
shall be effected on a record holder-by-record holder basis, such that all fractional shares
resulting from the Reverse Stock Split of a given record holder's Common Stock shall be
aggregated. After aggregating fractional shares in accordance with the previous sentence, no
remaining fractional share of Common Stock shall be issued as a result of the Reverse Stock
Split. In lieu of any fractional share to which a record holder would otherwise be entitled,
the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair market value of
one share of Common Stock as determined in good faith by the Corporation's Board of
Directors (the "Board").

(c) Section (A)(2), below, of this Article II sets forth the total authorized capital
stock of the Corporation after giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split. The rights,
preferences and privileges of the Common Stock and Preferred Stock (as defined below) as
set forth herein have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split (that is, all numeric

I. Dividends

When, as and if declared by the Board the holders of shares of Series A Preferred
shall be entitled to receive dividends out of any assets legally available therefor, prior and in
preference to any declaration or payment of any dividend (other than dividends payable in

provided that an adjustment to the Series A Conversion Price (as defined below) has been
made in accordance with Section 3(d)(ti) below) on the Common Stock of the Corporation, at
the rate of $0.03695 per share per annum on each outstanding share of Series A Preferred
(subject to proportional adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split,
combinations, recapitalization, reclassification or other similar event affecting such shares).

are not declared. After satisfaction of the foregoing dividend preference, the Series A

dividend declared and paid with respect to the Common Stock. For the purpose of
determining the legality of distributions pursuant to Section 23B,06.400(2)(b) of the Revised

[61016-0002/SB061250,007]

(i) The holders of shares of Series A Preferred then outstanding shall be
entitled to be paid out of the Distributable Proceeds, before any payment is made to the
holders of Common Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount equal to $0.4619
per share of Series A Preferred (subject to proportional adjustment in the event of any stock
dividend, stock split, combination, recapitalization, reclassification or other similar event
with respect to the Series A Preferred) (the "Series A Liquidation Amount") plus any
declared but unpaid dividends on such shares of Series A Preferred, If, upon any such
Liquidation Event, the Distributable Proceeds are insufficient to pay the holders of Series A
Preferred the full amount of the Series A Liquidation Amount plus any declared but unpaid
dividends thereon, then all Distributable Proceeds shall be distributed ratably among the
holders of Series A Preferred in proportion to the preferential amount each such holder
otherwise would have been entitled to receive,

(ii) | Upon the completion of the distributions to the holders of Series A
Preferred as described above, the remaining Distributable Proceeds shall be distributed
among the holders of Common Stock pro rata based on the number of shares of Common
Stock held by each. Nothing contained in this Section 2 shall limit the right of holders of
Series A Preferred to convert their shares into Common Stock at any time prior to or
simultaneously with the closing of a Liquidation Event, provided that shares of Series A
Preferred shall not be entitled to be converted into shares of Common Stock in order to
participate in any Liquidation Event, or series of Liquidation Events, as shares of Common
Stock, without first foregoing participation in the Liquidation Event, or series of Liquidation
Events, as shares of Series A Preferred.

the capital stock of the Corporation or the surviving or acquiring entity (or its parent entity));
or (C) a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation (whether voluntary or
involuntary), Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) a transaction under (B) of the prior
sentence shall not constitute a Liquidation Event if its purpose is (x) to change the state of the
Corporation's incorporation, or (y) to create a holding company that will be owned in
substantially the same proportions by the persons who held the Corporation's securities
immediately prior to such transaction; and (2) any transaction or event otherwise constituting
a Liquidation Event under this paragraph shall be deemed to be exempt from such definition
if (x) the holders of a majority of the then outstanding Series A Preferred so agree by vote or
written consent or (y) the Board (including at least one Series A Director, as defined below)
specifically approves the transaction or event as an exempt transaction or event from the
definition of a Liquidation Event.

deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the
twenty trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to the closing; and

(3) ‘If there is no active public market, the value shall be the
fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Corporation and the holders of at
least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock.

(B) The method of valuation of securities subject to investment
letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by
virtue of a shareholder's status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an
appropriate discount from the market value determined as above in Section 2(b)(ii)(A} to
reflect the approximate fair market value thereof, 2s determined in good faith by the Board.

3. Conversion

The holders of the Series A Preferred shall have the right to convert their shares of
Preferred Stock into Common Stock as provided in this Section 3.

(a) Voluntary Conversion

Subject to Section 3(c), each share of Series A Preferred shall be convertible,
at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share, at the
office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for such stock, into such number of fully paid
and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Series A
Liquidation Amount by the Series A Conversion Price (as defined below) in effect on the
effective date of such conversion, as determined below. The initial Series A Conversion
Price shall be equal to the Series A Liquidation Amount (the "Series A Conversion Price").
Such initial Series A Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in
Section 3(d).

[61016-0002/S BD6 [250.007]

(b) Automatic Conversion

Each share of Series A Preferred shall automatically be converted into shares of
Common Stock at the Series A Conversion Price at the time in effect for such share
immediately upon the earlier of (i) the date specified by the affirmative vote or consent of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred, and (ii) the effective
date of the registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act"), with respect to an underwritten public offering of the Corporation's
Common Stock in which the public offering price results in gross proceeds to the
Corporation of at least $30,000,000 (a "Qualified Public Offering").

{c) Mechanics of Conversion

Before any holder of Series A Preferred shall be entitled to convert such shares into
shares of Common Stock under Section 3(a) above, such holder shall (i) (A) surrender the
certificate or certificates for the shares to be converted, duly endorsed, at the office of the
Corporation or of any transfer agent for such series of Preferred Stock, or (B) notify the
Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and
execute an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any
loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates, and (ii) give written notice to the
Corporation at its principal corporate office of the election to convert such shares and shall
state therein the name or names in which the certificate or certificates for the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion are to be issued. The Corporation shall, as
soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred
Stock, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the
number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled upon such
conversion, Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the
close of business on the date on which the requirements of the first sentence of this paragraph
have been satisfied with respect to the shares of such series of Preferred Stock to be
converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable
upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such
shares of Common Stock as of such date. In connection with any automatic conversion of
Preferred Stock under Section 3(b) above, such conversion shall be deemed effective with
respect to all shares of such Preferred Stock so converted as of the effective date of the vote
or consent referred to in clause (i) of such subsection or the effective date of the Qualified
Public Offering registration statement referred to in clause (ii) of such subsection; provided,
however, that if the automatic conversion is in connection with a Qualified Public Offering,
the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering such Preferred Stock for
conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of securities
pursuant to such Qualified Public Offering, in which event the person(s) entitled to receive
the shares of Common Stock issuable upon-conversion of such Preferred Stock shal! not be
deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such
sale of securities. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after the effective date of any
automatic conversion, issue and deliver, at the Corporation's principal corporate office, to
each holder of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or

(61016-0002/5B06 ) 250,007]

certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled
upon such conversion, subject to any such holder first providing to the Corporation the
documentation referred to in clauses (i)(A) or (i)(B) of this paragraph. The person or persons
entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be
treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock as of
the effective date of conversion as provided above.

(d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock for Certain
Dilutive Issuances, Splits and Combinations

The Series A Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as
follows:

(i) Issuance of Additional Stock below Purchase Price. If the
Corporation shall issue, after the first issuance of shares of Series A Preferred (the "Series A
Purchase Date"), any Additional Stock (as defined below) for a consideration per share less
than the Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such
Additional Stock, then, in each such case, the applicable Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such issuance shall automatically be adjusted as set forth in this
Section 3(d)(i), unless otherwise provided in this Section 3(d)(i).

(A) Adjustment Formula. Whenever the Series A Conversion
Price is adjusted pursuant to this Section 3(d)(i), the new applicable Conversion Price shall
be determined by multiplying the applicable Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to
the issuance of Additional Stock by a fraction, (x) the numerator of which shall be the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (or deemed to be outstanding pursuant to
Section 3(d)(iE) below) immediately prior to such issuance (the "Outstanding Common")
plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received by the
Corporation for such issuance would purchase at such Conversion Price; and (y) the
denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Outstanding Common plus the
number of shares of such Additional Stock.

(B) Definition of Additional Stock, For purposes of this
Section 3(d)(i), "Additional Stock" shall mean any shares of Common Stock issued (or
deemed to have been issued pursuant to Section OE) by the Corporation after the
Series A Purchase Date, other than:

(1) | Common Stock issued pursuant to a transaction
described in Section 3(d)(ii) hereof;

(2) Capital stock, or warrants or options to purchase capital
stock, issued to employees, directors, consultants or other service providers of the
Corporation pursuant to a stock option plan or other compensatory agreements or
arrangements approved by the Board;

[61016-G002/SB06 1250,007]

(3) Capital stock, or warrants or options to purchase capital
stock, issued in connection with bona fide acquisitions, mergers or similar transactions;

(4) Capital stock, or options or warrants to purchase capital
stock, issued in connection with commercial credit arrangements, equipment financings, or
similar transactions, plans or arrangements, provided that such transactions, plans or
arrangements are effected primarily for purposes other than raising equity capital;

(5) | Common Stock issued or issuable upon conversion of
the Series A Preferred:

(6) | Common Stock issued or issuable in a Qualified Public
Offering;

(7) Capital stock issued or issuable upon exercise of
options, warrants or convertible notes of the Corporation outstanding as of the Series A
Purchase Date; or

(8) Capital stock, or options or warrants to purchase capital
stock, issued in connection with strategic collaborations, development agreements, licensing
transactions or similar transactions, plans or arrangements, provided that such transactions,
plans or arrangements are effected primarily for purposes other than raising equity capital,

(C) No Fractional Adjustments, No adjustment of the Series A
Conversion Price shall be made in an amount less than one hundredth of a cent per share,
provided that any adjustments which are not required to be made by reason of this sentence
shall be carried forward and shall be either taken into account in any subsequent adjustment
made prior to three years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being
carried forward, or shall be made at the end of three years from the date of the event giving
rise to the adjustment being carried forward.

(D) Determination of Consideration, In the case of the issuance
of Common Stock for cash, the consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid
therefor before deducting any reasonable discounts, commissions, compensations or
concessions allowed, paid or incurred by the Corporation for any underwriting or otherwise
in connection with the issuance and sale thereof and without deductions of any other
expenses paid by the Corporation, In the case of the issuance of Common Stock for a
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be
deemed to be the fair value thereof as determined in good faith by the Board irrespective of
any accounting treatment.

(E) Deemed Issuances of Common Stock, In the case of the
issuance of options or warrants to purchase, or other rights to subscribe for, shares of
Common Stock, securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for Common
Stock, or options or warrants to purchase, or other rights to subscribe for, such convertible or

[61016-0002/SB061250.007]

exchangeable securities, the following provisions shall apply for all purposes of this
Section 3(d)(i):

(1) The aggregate maximum number of shares of Common
Stock deliverable upon exercise (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to exercisability,
including without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account potential
antidilution adjustments) of such options or warrants to purchase, or other rights to subscribe
for, Common Stock shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such options, warrants or
rights were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the
manner provided in Section 3(d)(@)(D)), if any, received by the Corporation upon the
issuance of such options, warrants or rights plus the minimum exercise price provided in
such options, warrants or rights (without taking into account potential antidilution
adjustments) for the Common Stock covered thereby.

consideration equal to the consideration, if any, received by the Corporation for any such
securities and related options, warrants or rights (excluding any cash received on account of
accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the minimum additional consideration, if any, to
be received by the Corporation (without taking into account potential antidilution
adjustments) upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or the exercise of any
related options, warrants or rights (the consideration in each case to be determined in the
manner provided in Section 3(d)(i)(D)).

Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon exercise
of such options, warrants or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such convertible
or exchangeable securities, including without limitation a change resulting from the
antidilution provisions thereof, the Series A Conversion Price, to the extent in any way
affected by or computed using such options, warrants, rights or securities, shall be

{and convertible or exchangeable securities which remain in effect) actually issued upon the
exercise of such options, warrants or rights, upon the conversion or exchange of such
securities or upon the exercise of the options, warrants or rights related to such securities.

(5) The number of shares of Common Stock deemed issued
and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to Sections 3(d)(#)(E)(1) and
3(d)(i)(E){2) shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or expiration
of the type described in either Section 3(d)(i)(E)(3) or 3(d){i)(E)(4).

(F) No Increased Conversion Price. Notwithstanding any other
provisions of this Section 3(d)(i), except to the limited extent provided for in
Sections 3(d)(i)E)(3) and 3(d)(i)(E)(4), no adjustment of the Series A Conversion Price

(G) Waiver of Adjustment, Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, any downward adjustment of the Series A Conversion Price may be waived,
either prospectively or retroactively and either generally or in a particular instance, by the
consent or vote of either (1) the holders of the majority of the outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred, or (2) the Board (including at least one Series A Director). Any such waiver shall
bind all future holders of shares of Series A Preferred.

any time or from time to time after the Series A Purchase Date fix a record date for the
effectuation of a split or subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or the |
determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive a dividend or other
distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock or other securities or rights
convertible into, or entitling the holder thereof to receive directly or indirectly, additional
shares of Common Stock (hereinafter referred to as "Common Stock Equivaients") without
payment of any consideration by such holder for the additional shares of Common Stock or
the Common Stock Equivalents (including the additional shares of Common Stock issuable
upon conversion or exercise thereof), then, as of such record date (or the date of such
dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no record date is fixed), the Series A Conversion
Price shall be appropriately decreased so that the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable on conversion of each share of Series A Preferred shall be increased in proportion to
such increase of the aggregate of shares of Common Stock outstanding and shares issuable
with respect to Common Stock Equivalents, with the number of shares issuable with respect
to Common Stock Equivalents determined from time to time in the manner provided for
deemed issuances in Section 3(d)(i)(E).

(iii) | Reverse Stock Splits. If the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding at any time after the Series A Purchase Date is decreased by a reverse split or
combination of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, then, following the record date of
such reverse split or combination, the Series A Conversion Price shall be appropriately
increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each

-9-
{61016-0002/$8061250.007)

share of Series A Preferred shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding
shares of Common Stock.

Subject to Section 1 above, in the event the Corporation shall declare a distribution
payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by the Corporation or
other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options, warrants or rights not referred to
in Section 3(d)(ii), then, in each such case for the purpose of this Section 3(e), the holders of
each series of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any such
distribution as though they were the holders of the number of shares of Common Stock of the
Corporation into which their shares of Preferred Stock are convertible as of the record date
fixed for the determination of the holders of Common Stock of the Corporation entitled to
receive such distribution,

(f) Recapitalizations

if at any time or from time to time there shall be a recapitalization of the Common
Stock (other than a subdivision, combination or merger or sale of assets transaction provided
for elsewhere in this Section 3 or in Section 2), provision shall be made so that the holders of
the Series A Preferred shall thereafter be entitled to receive, upon conversion of such
Preferred Stock, the number of shares of capital stock or other securities or property of the
Corporation (or otherwise} to which a holder of the Common Stock deliverable upon
conversion of such Preferred Stock would have been entitled on such recapitalization if such
Common Stock had been outstanding at the time of such transaction. In any such case,
appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 3
with respect to the rights of the holders of such Preferred Stock after the recapitalization to
the end that the provisions of this Section 3 (including adjustment of the Series A Conversion
Price then in effect and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of such Preferred
Stock) shall be applicable after that event and be as nearly equivalent as practicable,

(g) No Fractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments

(i) No fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of any share
or shares of Preferred Stock, and the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued shall
be rounded to the nearest whole share, With respect to any fraction of a share called for upon
the conversion of Series A Preferred, an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the then
current Series A Conversion Price, as applicable, shall be paid in cash to the holder otherwise
entitled to receive such fractional shares, unless such payment is waived by the holders of'a
majority of the outstanding Preferred Stock (at a meeting or by written consent), The number
of shares issuable to each holder upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of
the total number of shares of Series A Preferred that the holder is at the time converting into
Common Stock and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such aggregate
conversion,

(ii) | Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the
Series A Conyersion Price pursuant to this Section 3, the Corporation, at its expense, shall
promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and
prepare and furnish to each holder of such Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such
adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or
readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any
holder of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate
setting forth (A) such adjustment and readjustment, (B) the Series A Conversion Price at the
time in effect, and (C) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of
other property which at the time would be received upon the conversion of a share of Series
A Preferred.

The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but
unissued shares of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the
shares of the Series A Preferred, such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from
time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of the outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred. If at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock
shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of al! then outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred, the Corporation shall take such corporate action as may be necessary to increase
its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be
sufficient for such purposes, including without limitation engaging in reasonable efforts to
obtain the requisite shareholder approval of any necessary amendment to the Corporation's S
Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation,

converted, redeemed, repurchased or acquired shall be canceled and cease to be authorized

reorganization, recapitalization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or
sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or
performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Corporation,
but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Section
3 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect
the conversion rights of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock against impairment.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 3(j) shall prohibit the Corporation
from amending its Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation with the requisite
consent of the Board and the Corporation's shareholders as set forth in Section 4 below,
