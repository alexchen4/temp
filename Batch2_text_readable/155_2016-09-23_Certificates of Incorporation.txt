The following is a statement of the designations and the powers, privileges and rights,
and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof in respect of each class of capital stock
of the Corporation.

A. COMMON STOCK.

1, General. The voting, dividend and liquidation rights of the holders of the
Common Stock are subject to and qualified by the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock as
may be designated by the Board of Directors upon any issuance of the Preferred Stock of any
series.

2. Voting. The holders of the Common Stock are entitled to one vote for
each share of Common Stock held at all meetings of stockholders (and actions by written consent
of the stockholders in lieu of meetings) with respect to any and all matters presented to the
stockholders of the Corporation for their action or consideration. There shall be no cumulative
voting.

3. Number of Shares. Subject to any other votes required as set forth herein,
the number of authorized shares of Common Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below
the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote, irrespective of the provisions of
Section 242(b)(2) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.

4. Dividends. Dividends may be declared and paid on the Common Stock
from funds lawfully available therefor if, as and when determined by the Board of Directors and
subject to any preferential dividend rights of any then outstanding Preferred Stock.

5. Liquidation, Upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary (a “Liquidation Event”), or upon an event
described in Section B.2(k) of this Article Fourth that is deemed to be a Liquidation Event, the
holders of Common Stock will be entitled to receive all assets of the Corporation available for
distribution to its stockholders, subject to any preferential rights of any then outstanding
Preferred Stock.
B. PREFERRED STOCK.

1. Dividends, The holders of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive,
in preference to the holders of the Junior Stock (as defined in Section B.2(a) below), out of funds
legally available therefor, if, as and when declared by the Corporation’s Board of Directors, cash
dividends annually at a rate equal to the greater of (i) eight percent (8.0%) per annum multiplied
by the original purchase price per share paid to the Corporation by the initial holder of such
share, and (ii) the dividends payable on the Common Stock into which such shares of Preferred
Stock would have been converted, had such shares of Preferred Stock been converted into shares
of Common Stock on the record date for the dividend (the “Dividend Rate”). Such dividends
shall not be cumulative. Unless all declared dividends on the Preferred Stock shall have been
paid or a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart, no dividend shall be paid or declared,
and no distribution shall be made, on any Junior Stock and no redemption of any Junior Stock
shall occur. Except as otherwise provided herein, if at any time the Corporation pays less than
the total amount of dividends then declared but unpaid with respect to the Preferred Stock, such
payment shall be distributed ratably among the holders of Preferred Stock in proportion to the
payment each such holder would receive if the full amount of such dividend were paid. Upon
any conversion of shares of Preferred Stock, all rights to such preferential dividends (whether or
not declared) on such shares shall terminate.

The original purchase price per share for each series of Preferred Stock for the purpose of
calculating dividends, and for all other purposes of this Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, is as follows (with all per share figures subject to appropriate adjustment in the
event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization affecting
such shares): $0.75 per share for the Series A Preferred Stock (the “Series A Original Purchase
Price”), $1.175 per share for the Series B Preferred Stock (the “Series B Original Purchase
Price”), $1.38 per share for the Series B-1 Preferred Stock (the “Series B-1 Original Purchase
Price”), $1.8905 per share for the Series C Preferred Stock (the “Series C Original Purchase
Price”), $2.9815 per share for the Series D Preferred Stock (the “Series D Original Purchase
Price”), $2.4854 per share for the Series E Preferred Stock (the “Series E Original Purchase
Price”), $1.5855 per share for the Series F Preferred Stock (the “Series F Original Purchase
Price”), $1.5855 per share for the Series G Preferred Stock (the “Series G Original Purchase
Price”) and $1.5855 per share for the Series H Preferred Stock (the “Series H Original Purchase
Price”).

2. Distributions to Preferred Stockholders upon a Liquidation Event.

(a) Upon a Liquidation Event, the holders of shares of Preferred Stock
then outstanding (and which have not been surrendered for conversion as provided in
Section B.4 of this Article Fourth) shall be entitled to be paid out of the total amount of funds
and other assets available for distribution to the Corporation’s stockholders (the “Total
Distributable Amount”), before any payment shall be made to the holders of Common Stock or
any other class or series of stock ranking on liquidation junior to the Preferred Stock (such
Common Stock and other stock being collectively referred to as “Junior Stock”) by reason of
their ownership thereof, the amount determined pursuant to subsections (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g)
and/or (h) below, as applicable.
(b) Upon a Liquidation Event, the holders of the Series H Preferred
Stock shall receive, prior and in preference to any distribution of any assets or funds of the
Corporation legally available for distribution to the holders of any other capital stock of the
Corporation by reason of their ownership of such stock, an amount per share equal to the sum of
(i) three (3) times the Series H Original Purchase Price for each share of Series H Preferred
Stock then held by them, plus (11) any declared but unpaid dividends on such shares held by them
(the “Series H Initial Liquidation Amount”), provided that if the assets and funds legally
available for distribution are insufficient to pay the Series H Initial Liquidation Amount for each
outstanding share of Series H Preferred Stock, then the lesser amount that is available for
distribution will be distributed among the holders of Series H Preferred Stock pro rata.
Immediately after the payment described in the foregoing sentence, to the extent there are
remaining assets and/or funds of the Corporation legally available for distribution to the
Corporation’s stockholders, the holders of the Series H Preferred Stock shall receive, prior and in
preference to any distribution of any assets or funds of the Corporation legally available for
distribution to the holders of any other capital stock of the Corporation by reason of their
ownership of such stock, an amount per share equal to $0.0031 (as appropriately adjusted for

and funds legally available for distribution are insufficient to pay such amount for each

(d) After the distributions set forth in Sections B.2(b) and B.2(c) above
have been made, to the extent there are remaining assets and/or funds of the Corporation legally
available for distribution to the Corporation’s stockholders, the holders of the Series H Preferred

Corporation legally available for distribution to the holders of any other capital stock of the
Corporation by reason of their ownership of such stock, an amount per share equal to $0.0292 (as
appropriately adjusted for stock splits and the like) for an aggregate amount to all holders of
Series H Preferred Stock equal to $1,213,891.67 (the “Series H Second Catch-Up Liquidation
Amount”), provided that if the assets and funds legally available for distribution are insufficient
to pay such amount for each outstanding share of Series H Preferred Stock, then the lesser
amount that is available for distribution will be distributed among the holders of Series H
Preferred Stock pro rata,
(e) After the distributions set forth in Sections B.2(b), B.2(c) and
B.2(d) above have been made, to the extent there are remaining assets and/or funds of the

to all holders of Series H Preferred Stock equal to $1,276,250.22 (the “Series H Third Catch-Up
Liquidation Amount” and, together with the Series H Initial Liquidation Amount, the Series H
First Catch-Up Liquidation Amount and the Series H Second Catch-Up Liquidation Amount, the
“Series H Liquidation Amount”), provided that if the assets and funds legally available for

B.2(e), B.2(f) and B.2(g) above have been made, to the extent there are remaining assets and/or
funds of the Corporation legally available for distribution to the Corporation’s stockholders, they
shall be distributed ratably among the holders of shares of Preferred Stock, Common Stock and
any other class or series of stock entitled to participate in liquidation distributions with the
holders of Common Stock, in such a manner as if all the shares of Preferred Stock shall have
been converted into Common Stock at the then applicable Conversion Price for each such series
of Preferred Stock in accordance with this Amended and Restated Certificate, provided that the

(including all amounts distributed pursuant to Section B.2(g) above) equal to two (2) times the
Series A Original Purchase Price per share for the Series A Preferred Stock, the holders of Series

4
amounts distributed pursuant to Sections B.2(b), B.2(d) and B.2(f) above) equal to five (5) times
the Series H Original Purchase Price per share for the Series H Preferred Stock, provided that
when calculating the amounts received pursuant to Sections B.2(b), B.2(c), B.2(d), B.2(e), B.2(f)
and B.2(g) for purposes of this Section B.2(h), the amount of any declared and unpaid dividends
shall be disregarded.

(i) After the distributions set forth in Sections B.2(b), B.2(c), B.2(d),
B.2(e), B.2(f), B.2(g) and B.2(h) above have been made, to the extent there are remaining assets
and/or funds of the Corporation legally available for distribution to the Corporation’s
stockholders, they shall be distributed among the holders of shares of Common Stock and any
other class or series of stock (excluding the Preferred Stock) entitled to participate in liquidation
distributions with the holders of Common Stock, pro rata based on the number of shares of
Common Stock held by each (assuming conversion into Common Stock of all such shares of any
other class or series of stock).

Gj) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections B.2(a) through (i) of
this Article Fourth, in the event the amount distributable to the Corporation’s stockholders in
connection with a Liquidation Event is payable in installments that are not subject to the
satisfaction of any contingencies, which distributions shall be covered by Section B.2(1) of this
Article Fourth, then prior to the time a distribution (the “Current Distribution”) is to be made, the
total amount available for the Current Distribution will be cumulated with all prior distributions
made in connection with the Liquidation Event, and a calculation of the amount distributable to
each stockholder will be made as if the total cumulative amount had been paid in a single initial
distribution, assuming for purposes of such calculation that each series of Preferred Stock elected
to convert such series of Preferred Stock to Common Stock in a manner that would yield such
series of Preferred Stock the largest distribution. The amount allocated to each stockholder in
such calculation is called the stockholder’s “Cumulative Distribution.” In the Current
Distribution, each stockholder will receive an amount such that when the portion of the Current
Distribution distributed to such stockholder is added to all prior distributions to such stockholder
in connection with the Liquidation Event, such stockholder will have received its Cumulative
Distribution.

(k) In the event of any merger or consolidation of the Corporation into
or with another corporation (except one in which the holders of capital stock of the Corporation
immediately prior to such merger or consolidation continue to hold at least seventy percent
(70.0%) by voting power of the capital stock of the surviving corporation), the sale of all of the
outstanding capital stock of the Corporation to a single entity or group of related entities in one
transaction or a series of transactions or the sale of all or substantially all the assets of the
Corporation, such merger, consolidation, stock sale or asset sale shall be deemed to be a
Liquidation Event and all consideration payable to the stockholders of the Corporation (in case
of a merger, consolidation or stock sale) or all consideration payable to the Corporation, together
with all other available assets of the Corporation (in case of an asset sale), shall be distributed to
the holders of capital stock of the Corporation in accordance with Sections B.2(a) through (i) of
this Article Fourth, unless (1) the holders of at least fifty percent (50.0%) of the then outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock elect not to treat such event as a Liquidation Event and (ii) the holders
of a majority of the Series H Preferred Stock elect not to treat such event as a Liquidation Event,
in each case, by giving written notice thereof to the Corporation at least three (3) days before the

8
effective date of such event. The Corporation shall promptly provide to the holders of shares of
Preferred Stock such information concerning the terms of such merger, consolidation, stock sale
or asset sale and the value of the assets of the Corporation as may reasonably be requested by the
holders of Preferred Stock in order to assist them in determining whether to make such an
election. The Corporation shall use its best efforts to ensure that the agreement or plan of merger
or consolidation applies a rate at which the shares of capital stock of the Corporation are
converted into or exchanged for cash, new securities or other property to give effect to Sections
B.2(a) through (i) of this Article Fourth. In any Liquidation Event, if the proceeds received by
the Corporation or its stockholders are comprised of any combination of cash, promissory notes,
securities and/or other property (each, a “Form of Proceeds”), then pro rata distributions of each
Form of Proceeds shall be made in such priority and amounts as required to satisfy the
distribution requirements specified in Section B.2(a) through (i) of this Article Fourth. The
amount deemed distributed to the holders of Preferred Stock upon any such merger or
consolidation shall be the cash or the value of the property, rights or securities distributed to such
holders by the acquiring person, firm or other entity. The value of such property, rights or other
securities shall be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation and the
holders of a majority of the Preferred Stock, provided that if the property is securities that are
traded on a securities exchange, the Nasdaq Stock Market or over-the-counter, the value of the
securities shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices (with respect to securities listed
on a securities exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market) or the closing bid and ask prices (with
respect to securities listed over-the-counter) of the securities on such exchange or over-the-
counter over the ten (10) day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing of the transaction
which will constitute a liquidation of the Corporation.

(1) In a Liquidation Event, if any portion of the consideration payable
to the stockholders of the Corporation is payable only upon satisfaction of contingencies (the
“Additional Consideration’), the applicable sale agreement shall provide that (a) the portion of
such consideration that is not Additional Consideration (such portion, the “Initial
Consideration”) shall be allocated among the holders of capital stock of the Corporation in
accordance with the above liquidation provisions as if the Initial Consideration were the only
consideration payable in connection with such Liquidation Event; and (b) any Additional
Consideration which becomes payable to the stockholders of the Corporation upon satisfaction of
such contingencies shall be allocated among the holders of capital stock of the Corporation in
accordance with the above liquidation provisions after taking into account the previous payment
of the Initial Consideration as part of the same transaction. Consideration placed into escrow or
retained as holdback to be available for satisfaction of indemnification or similar obligations in
connection with such Liquidation Event shall be deemed to be Additional Consideration.

(m) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if a share of
Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series B-1 Preferred Stock, Series C
Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock, Series F Preferred Stock,
Series G Preferred Stock or Series H Preferred Stock would receive a greater amount per share if
all such shares of such Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series B-1 Preferred
Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock, Series F
Preferred Stock, Series G Preferred Stock or Series H Preferred Stock, respectively and as
applicable, had been converted into Common Stock immediately prior to the Liquidation Event,
then each such share of such respective and applicable series of Preferred Stock shall

9
automatically be paid on an as-converted to Common Stock basis in lieu of receiving the lesser
liquidation amounts set forth above.

(a) General. Each holder of outstanding shares of Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of whole shares of Common Stock
into which the shares of Preferred Stock held by such holder are then convertible (as adjusted
from time to time pursuant to Section B.4 of this Article Fourth), at each meeting of stockholders
of the Corporation (and actions by written consent of the stockholders in lieu of meetings) with
respect to any and all matters presented to the stockholders of the Corporation for their action or
consideration. There shall be no cumulative voting. Except as provided by law, by the
provisions of Section B.9(a)(v) hereof or by the provisions establishing any other series of
preferred stock, holders of Preferred Stock and of any other outstanding series of preferred stock
shall vote together with the holders of Common Stock as a single class.

(b) Size of Board of Directors. Unless increased or decreased in
accordance with Section B.7(1) hereof, the Board of Directors shall consist of nine (9) members,
who shall be elected as follows:

(i) KKR Athena Holdings L.P. (“KKR”) shall be entitled to
elect two (2) members of the Board of Directors (the “KKR Directors”).

(ii) HealthCare Royalty Partners II, L.P. (““HCRP”) shail be
entitled to elect two (2) members of the Board of Directors (the “HCRP Directors”),

(iii) The holders of a majority of the Series A Preferred Stock,
the Series B Preferred Stock, the Series B-1 Preferred Stock, the Series C Preferred Stock, the
Series D Preferred Stock, the Series E Preferred Stock, Series F Preferred Stock and Series G
Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class, shall be entitled to elect three (3) members of
the Board of Directors.

(iv) The holders of a majority of the Common Stock, voting as
a single class, shall be entitled to elect one (1) member of the Board of Directors.

(v) The holders of a majority of the Common Stock and the
Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class, shall be entitled to elect one (1) member of the
Board of Directors.

(c) Voting. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws, each director is entitled to one
vote on all matters submitted to a vote of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof,
provided, however, that (i) the KKR Directors shall be entitled, collectively, to two (2) votes as
directors of the Corporation, regardless of the number of KKR Directors then designated, with
such two (2) votes to be allocated among the KKR Directors then designated such that each KKR
Director shall have a number of votes equal to (A) the total number of votes to be allocated
among such KKR Directors divided by (B) the number of KKR Directors then designated (for
example, if only one KKR Director is then designated, such director would be entitled to two (2)

10
votes) and (11) the HCRP Directors shall be entitled, collectively, to two (2) votes as directors of
the Corporation, regardless of the number of HCRP Directors then designated, with such two (2)
votes to be allocated among the HCRP Directors then designated such that each HCRP Director
shall have a number of votes equal to (A) the total number of votes to be allocated among such
HCRP Directors divided by (B) the number of HCRP Directors then designated (for example, if
only one HCRP Director is then designated, such director would be entitled to two (2) votes). A
director’s voting power for any action taken by a committee of the Board of Directors of the
Corporation, and by any subcommittee of a committee of the Board of Directors of the
Corporation, shall be the same as such director’s voting power with respect to action taken by the
Board of Directors of the Corporation.

4, Optional Conversion,

(a) Right to Convert. After the first issuance of a share of Series H
Preferred Stock, each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of the holder
thereof, at any time and from time to time, and without the payment of additional consideration
by the holder thereof, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock
as is determined by dividing the Original Purchase Price for the applicable series of Preferred
Stock by its Conversion Price (as defined below) in effect at the time of conversion. The initial
“Conversion Price” shall be the Series A Original Purchase Price for the Series A Preferred
Stock, the Series B Original Purchase Price for the Series B Preferred Stock, the Series B-1
Original Purchase Price for the Series B-1 Preferred Stock, the Series C Original Purchase Price
for the Series C Preferred Stock, the Series D Original Purchase Price for the Series D Preferred
Stock, the Series E Original Purchase Price for the Series E Preferred Stock, the Series F
Original Purchase Price for the Series F Preferred Stock, the Series G Original Purchase Price for
the Series G Preferred Stock and the Series H Original Purchase Price for the Series H Preferred
Stock.

In the event of a liquidation of the Corporation, the conversion rights shall terminate at
the close of business on the first (1st) full day immediately preceding the date fixed for the
payment of any amounts distributable on liquidation to the holders of Preferred Stock.

(b) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be
issued upon conversion of the Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the
holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay to such holder an amount equal to
such fraction multiplied by the fair market value of the Common Stock as determined in good
faith by the Corporation’s Board of Directors.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion.

(i) If a holder of Preferred Stock elects to convert shares of
Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section B.4(a) above, such holder
shall surrender the certificate or certificates for such shares of Preferred Stock at the principal
office of the Corporation together with written notice that such holder elects to convert all or any
number of the shares of the Preferred Stock represented by such certificate or certificates. Such
notice shall state such holder’s name or the names of the nominees in which such holder wishes
the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued and the effective date of

11
the conversion (the “Conversion Date”), which may be any date within the sixty (60) day period
following the date on which such notice is received by the Corporation. If required by the
Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by a
written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly
executed by the registered holder or such holder’s attorney duly authorized in writing. The
converting holder shall be deemed to be the record holder of the resulting shares of Common
Stock on the Conversion Date and the Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after the
Conversion Date (and in any event within fifteen (15) business days), issue and deliver at such
office of such holder of Preferred Stock, or to such holder’s nominees, a certificate or certificates
for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled, together with
payment in lieu of any fraction of a share pursuant to Section B.4(b) above.

(ii) | The Corporation shall at all times when the Preferred Stock
shall be outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued stock, for the
purpose of effecting the conversion of the Preferred Stock, such number of its duly authorized
shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all
outstanding Preferred Stock. Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment
reducing the Conversion Price below the then par value of the shares of Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation will, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary
in order that the Corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion Price.

(iii) Upon any such conversion, no adjustment to the
Conversion Price shall be made for any declared but unpaid dividends on the Preferred Stock
surrendered for conversion or on the Common Stock delivered upon conversion.

(iv) On the Conversion Date, all shares of Preferred Stock
which shall have been surrendered for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed
to be outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares, including the rights, if any, to receive
notices and to vote, shall immediately cease and terminate, except only the right of the holders
thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor and payment of any dividends
declared but unpaid thereon. Any shares of Preferred Stock so converted shall be retired and
cancelled and shall not be reissued, and the Corporation (without the need for stockholder action)
may from thereafter take such appropriate action as may be necessary to reduce the authorized
Preferred Stock accordingly.

(v) | The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and other taxes
(other than taxes based on income) that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of
shares of Common Stock upon conversion of shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this
Section B.4. The Corporation shall not, however, be required to pay any tax which may be
payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of shares of Common
Stock in a name other than that in which the shares of Preferred Stock so converted were
registered, and no such issuance or delivery shall be made unless and until the person or entity
requesting such issuance has paid to the Corporation the amount of any such tax or has
established, to the satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax has been paid.

12
(d) Adjustment for Dilution. If at any time after the Filing Date, the
Corporation shall issue any shares of Common Stock, or shall issue any Common Stock
Equivalents (as hereinafter defined), for a consideration per share less than the Conversion Price
for any series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Common
Stock or Common Stock Equivalents, the Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock in
effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall be decreased to the amount determined in
accordance with the following formula:

Conversion Price = (P1 x Q1)+(P2 x Q2)
Q1+Q2
For purposes of the foregoing formula:

Pl = Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance.

Ql = Number of shares of Common Stock deemed outstanding (in
accordance with subparagraph (vi) below) immediately prior to such
issuance.

P2 = Average price per share received by the Corporation upon such
issuance (determined in accordance with subparagraphs (iii) and (vi)
below).

Q2 = Number of shares of Common Stock issued or sold, or deemed to

have been issued or sold (in accordance with subparagraph (vi)
below) upon such issuance.

For purposes of any adjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section B.4(d), the
following provisions shall be applicable:

(i) “Common Stock Equivalents” means any stock or security
convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock, including the Preferred
Stock, and any right, warrant or option to acquire Common Stock or any such convertible,
exercisable or exchangeable security, provided, that the term Common Stock Equivalents shall
not include any rights, warrants or options to acquire Common Stock where the exercise or
“strike” price, or other amount payable in connection with the exercise or exchange of such
security, exceeds the fair market value of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such
exercise.

(ii) | The per share consideration for the sale or issuance of
Common Stock shall be the price per share received by the Corporation before payment of
commissions, discounts and other expenses. The value of any non-cash consideration received
or receivable upon the sale or issuance of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents shall be
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

(iii) In the case of the sale or issuance of Common Stock
Equivalents, the per share consideration shall be determined by dividing the maximum number

13
of shares of Common Stock issuable with respect to such Common Stock Equivalents into the
aggregate consideration received by the Corporation upon the sale or issuance of such Common
Stock Equivalents plus the minimum aggregate amount of any additional consideration
receivable by the Corporation upon the conversion or exercise of such Common Stock
Equivalents. For the purpose of calculation, such maximum number of shares shall be assumed
to be issued on the earlier of the payment date or record date for a distribution of such Common
Stock Equivalents.

(iv) If any Common Stock Equivalents included in adjustments
under this Section B.4(d) expire or terminate without the Common Stock to which they related
having been issued, the Conversion Price shall be readjusted to eliminate the effect of the
assumed issuance of such Common Stock. If any Common Stock Equivalents by their terms
provide for subsequent increases in the additional consideration payable for the related Common
Stock or for subsequent decreases in the number of shares of Common Stock obtainable, then,
upon any such increase or decrease, the Conversion Price shall be appropriately readjusted to the
extent such Common Stock Equivalents have not then expired or been exercised or converted.
The aggregate increase in the Conversion Price caused by all such readjustments shall not exceed
the decrease in Conversion Price made upon the issuance of the Common Stock Equivalents to
which such readjustments relate. If any Common Stock Equivalents by their terms provide for
subsequent decreases in the additional consideration payable for the related Common Stock or
for subsequent increases in the number of shares of Common Stock obtainable, then, upon any
such decrease or increase, the Conversion Price shall be appropriately adjusted to the extent such
Common Stock Equivalents have not then expired or been exercised or converted.

(v) In case the Corporation shall declare a dividend or make
any other distribution upon any stock of the Corporation payable in Common Stock or Common
Stock Equivalents, such Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents shall be deemed to have
been issued or sold without consideration as of the earlier of the related record or payment date.

(vi) The number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any
point in time shall include all shares then issuable or to become issuable pursuant to any
Common Stock Equivalent then issued or to be issued.

(vii) The following issuances of Common Stock or Common
Stock Equivalents, which would otherwise trigger an adjustment of the Conversion Price under
this Section B.4(d), will not trigger such an adjustment: (1) any dividend or distribution on any
Preferred Stock; (2) any stock for which adjustment of the Conversion Price is made pursuant to
Section B.4(c) above or Sections B.4(f), B.4(g) or B.4(h) below; (3) securities offered by the
Corporation to the public in a Qualified Public Offering (as defined in Section B.5(a) below);
(4) securities reissued to directors, employees, or consultants following the Corporation’s
acquisition of such securities pursuant to restricted stock arrangements with individuals who
have terminated their relationship with the Corporation or shares subject to options granted to
individuals who have terminated their relationship with the Corporation which are not exercised;
(5) shares of Common Stock, or securities convertible into or exercisable for such shares, issued
pursuant to an agreement solely to acquire or license technology (including without limitation
sponsored research) by the Corporation or to a collaborative partner of the Corporation in
connection with a corporate partnering transaction, if such agreement is approved by the Board

14
of Directors; (6) securities issued pursuant to any right or agreement to the extent to which an
adjustment was previously made to the Conversion Price established by this Section B.4 with
respect to the initial sale or grant by the Corporation of such right or agreement; (7) all securities
issued or issuable pursuant to warrants or options outstanding on the Filing Date; (8) shares of
Common Stock (“Option Shares’) issued or issuable upon exercise of stock options (“Options”)
granted to directors, officers, employees and consultants of the Corporation, which are approved
by a majority of the non-employee members of the Board of Directors, under either the
Corporation’s Amended and Restated 2002 Incentive and Non-Incentive Stock Option Plan or
the Corporation’s 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (collectively, the “Plans”) approved by the Board of
Directors and adopted by the stockholders, whether previously existing or granted after the Filing
Date, each of which Options has a per share exercise price that is not less than the per share fair
market value of the Common Stock on the date of the Option grant, and which number of Option
Shares does not exceed 12,484,416; (9) securities issued in connection with any acquisition
approved by a majority of the Board of Directors and by not less than eighty (80.0%) of the
outstanding shares of Series H Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, as required by Section
9(a)(vii) of this Article Fourth and which issuance of securities is approved by not less than fifty
percent (50.0%) of the outstanding shares of (x) Series H Preferred Stock, voting as a separate
class, as required by Section 9(b)(ii) of this Article Fourth and (y) Preferred Stock voting
together as a single class as required by Section 7(b) of this Article Fourth; (10) up to 5,628,902
shares of Series G Preferred Stock and up to 41,627,237 shares of Series H Preferred Stock
issued pursuant to the Series G and Series H Convertible Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement,
dated September 8, 2016 (it being understood that the Series C Stock Split, the Series D Stock
Split and the Series E Stock Split and the corresponding reduction in the Series C Original
Purchase Price, Series D Original Purchase Price and Series E Original Purchase Price and the
respective Conversion Price for each such series from the prices that were in effect prior to the
filing of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation reflect the anti-dilution
adjustment with respect to the issuance of Series G Preferred Stock and Series H Preferred Stock,
which are being made in lieu of, and have the same economic effect as, a reduction in the
Conversion Price for each such series that would otherwise have served as the anti-dilution
adjustment); (11) up to 9,854,935 shares of Series F Preferred Stock (and only for up to
9,854,935 shares of Series F Preferred Stock) issuable upon conversion of that certain Series F
Preferred Stock Purchase Warrant, issued on August 29, 2014 (the “Warrant’) (it being
understood that the Series C Stock Split, Series D Stock Split and Series E Stock Split and the
corresponding reduction in the Series C Original Purchase Price, Series D Original Purchase
Price and Series E Original Purchase Price and the respective Conversion Price for each such
series from the prices that were in effect prior to the filing of this Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation reflect the anti-dilution adjustment with respect to the issuance of the
Warrant, which are being made in lieu of, and have the same economic effect as, a reduction in
the Conversion Price for each such series that would otherwise have served as the anti-dilution
adjustment; and (12) Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Preferred Stock.

(e) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If the Corporation
shall at any time, or from time to time after the Filing Date, effect a subdivision of the

outstanding Common Stock, the Conversion Price then in effect immediately before that
subdivision shall be proportionately decreased. If the Corporation shall at any time, or from time
to time after the Filing Date, effect a subdivision of the Preferred Stock, the Conversion Price
with respect to the Preferred Stock then in effect immediately before that subdivision shall be

15
proportionately increased. If the Corporation shall at any time, or from time to time after the
Filing Date, combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price then in
effect immediately before the combination shall be proportionately increased. If the Corporation
shall at any time, or from time to time after the Filing Date, combine the outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock, the Conversion Price with respect to the Preferred Stock then in effect
immediately before the combination shall be proportionately decreased. Any adjustment under
this paragraph shall become effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or
combination becomes effective.

(f) Adjustment for Certain Dividends and Distributions. In the event
the Corporation at any time, or from time to time after the Filing Date, shall make or issue, or fix

arecord date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or
other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock, then, and in each such event,
the Conversion Price for the Preferred Stock then in effect shall be decreased as of the time of
such issuance or, in the event such a record date, shall have been fixed, as of the close of
business on such record date, by multiplying the Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction:

(1) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares
of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance
or the close of business on such record date, and

(2) the denominator of which shall be the total number of
shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such
issuance or the close of business on such record date plus the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution;

provided, however, if such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend is not fully paid
or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the Conversion Price for the
Preferred Stock shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record date
and thereafter the Conversion Price for the Preferred Stock shall be adjusted pursuant to this
paragraph as of the time of actual payment of such dividends or distributions; and provided
further, however, that no such adjustment shall be made if the holders of Preferred Stock
simultaneously receive a dividend or other distribution of shares of Common Stock in a number
equal to the number of shares of Common Stock as they would have received if all outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event.

(g) Adjustments for Other Dividends Distributions. In the event the
Corporation at any time, or from time to time after the Filing Date, shall make or issue or fix a
record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or
other distribution payable in securities of the Corporation other than shares of Common Stock,
then, and in each such event, provision shall be made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock
shall receive upon conversion thereof, in addition to the number of shares of Common Stock
receivable thereupon, the amount of securities of the Corporation that they would have received
had the Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event and had
they thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to, and including, the conversion
date, retained such securities receivable by them as aforesaid during such period, giving
application to all adjustments called for during such period under this paragraph with respect to

16
the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock; provided, however, that no such adjustment shall
be made if the holders of Preferred Stock simultaneously receive a dividend or other distribution
of such securities in an amount equal to the amount of such securities as they would have
received if all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock on
the date of such event.

(h) Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange or Substitution. If the
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same

or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by capital
reorganization, reclassification, or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares
or stock dividend provided for above, or a reorganization, merger, consolidation, or sale of assets
provided for below), then, and in each such event, the holder of each such share of Preferred
Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such share into the kind and amount of shares of
stock and other securities and property receivable upon such reorganization, reclassification, or
other change by holders of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of
Preferred Stock might have been converted immediately prior to such reorganization,
reclassification or change, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein.

(i) No Impairment. Without the requisite consents required under
Section B.7, the Corporation will not, by amendment of its Certificate of Incorporation or
through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of
securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of
any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Corporation, but will at all times
in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Section B.4 and in the taking
of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the rights of the holders
of the Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section B.4 against impairment.

(j) Certificate _as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each
adjustment or readjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section B.4, the Corporation,
at its expense, shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the
terms hereof and furnish to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such
adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or
readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon the written request at any time (but not more
than twice in any twelve (12) month period) of any holder of shares representing at least five
percent (5.0%) of the authorized number of shares of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be
furnished to such holder a similar certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and readjustments,
(ii) the Conversion Price then in effect, and (iii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the
amount, if any, of other property which then would be received upon the conversion of Preferred
Stock.

5. Mandatory Conversions.
(a) Qualified Public Offering; Affirmative Election.

(i) All outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall
automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the then effective Conversion Price
(provided, however, that with respect to clauses (A) and (B) below, all outstanding shares of

17
Series G Preferred Stock, and with respect to clauses (A), (B) and (C) below, all outstanding
shares of Series H Preferred Stock, shall be automatically converted into shares of Common
Stock at a price per share of $0.5285 (as appropriately adjusted for stock splits and the like))
upon the date (the “Mandatory Conversion Date”) that is the earlier to occur of (A) the closing of
the sale by the Corporation of shares of Common Stock in a firm commitment, underwritten
public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the “Securities Act”), through a firm acceptable to the Board of Directors of the
Corporation resulting in at least $25,000,000 of gross proceeds to the Corporation (before
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses) and a pre-money
valuation of at least $400,000,000 (a “Qualified Public Offering”), (B) the affirmative election of
(1) the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together
as a single class, and (2) the holders of a majority of the outstanding Series H Preferred Stock,
voting together as a single class, in connection with the closing of a firm commitment,
underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities
Act, covering the offer and sale of Common Stock for the account of the Corporation which is
not a Qualified Public Offering or (C) the closing of a firm commitment, underwritten public
offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of Common
Stock of the Corporation pursuant to the registration rights of the Series H Preferred Stock set
forth in Section 4.12 of that certain Amended and Restated Investors’ Rights Agreement between
the Corporation and certain of its stockholders, dated on or about September 20, 2016, as it may
be amended from time to time (the “Investors’ Rights Agreement”). For purposes of the
preceding sentence, pre-money valuation shall be calculated by multiplying (x) the per share
offering price of the Corporation’s shares in the public offering (before deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and offering expenses), by (y) the total number of shares of Common
Stock of the Corporation outstanding immediately before the closing of the public offering,
assuming conversion of then outstanding Preferred Stock, and including all other convertible
securities and Common Stock issuable upon exercise of all then outstanding options, rights, and
warrants.

(ii) All holders of record of shares of Preferred Stock will be
given ten (10) business days prior written notice of the Mandatory Conversion Date and the
place designated for mandatory conversion of all such shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this
Section B.5(a). Such notice shall be sent both by facsimile transmission (if a facsimile number
has been provided and is operational) and by first-class or registered mail, postage prepaid, to
each record holder of Preferred Stock at such holder’s facsimile number and address last shown
on the records of the Corporation for the Preferred Stock. Upon receipt of such notice, each
holder of shares of Preferred Stock shall surrender his, her or its certificate or certificates for all
such shares to the Corporation at the place designated in such notice, and shall thereafter receive
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to this Section B.5(a). On the Mandatory Conversion Date, all rights with respect to the
Preferred Stock so converted, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and vote, will
terminate, except only the rights of the holders thereof, upon surrender of their certificate or
certificates therefor, to receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which
such Preferred Stock has been converted and to receive all declared but unpaid dividends. If so
required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or
accompanied by written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the
Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or by such holder’s attorney duly authorized

18
in writing. As soon as practicable after the Mandatory Conversion Date and the surrender of the
certificate or certificates for Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall cause to be issued and
delivered to such holder a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common
Stock issuable on such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof and cash as provided
in Section B.4(b) in respect of any fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon
such conversion. All declared and unpaid dividends on shares of Preferred Stock shall be paid in
cash upon mandatory conversion pursuant to this Section 5(a).

(iii) All certificates evidencing shares of Preferred Stock which
are required to be surrendered for conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof shall,
from and after the Mandatory Conversion Date, be deemed to have been retired and cancelled
and the shares of Preferred Stock represented thereby converted into Common Stock for all
purposes, notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender such
certificates on or prior to such date. The Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate action
(without the need for stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized Preferred
Stock accordingly.

6. Redemption.

(a) In the event of any redemption of any Preferred Stock, for holders
of Series H Preferred Stock, the redemption price per share paid to the holders of the Series H
Preferred Stock shall be equal to the Series H Liquidation Amount, subject to appropriate
adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other similar
recapitalization affecting such shares, plus any dividends declared but unpaid thereon.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no shares of any series of Series A
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series B-1 Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock,
Series D Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock, Series F Preferred Stock, or Series G
Preferred Stock may be redeemed until the holders of the Series H Preferred Stock have been
redeemed in full in accordance with Section B.6(a).

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the holders of any
series of Preferred Stock be entitled to have such shares redeemed by the Corporation in
accordance with Section B.6(a) and B.6(b), unless the approval of the holders of Series H
Preferred Stock under Section B.9(a)(iv) is obtained.

7. Substantial Transactions Requiring Consent of Holders of Preferred Stock.
In addition to Section B.3 and any vote which any series of preferred stock may have under
Delaware law, so long as any shares of Preferred Stock shall be outstanding, the Corporation
shall not, without first obtaining the affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of not less
than fifty percent (50.0%) of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a
single class, on an as-converted to Common Stock basis (whether by merger, recapitalization or
otherwise):

(a) Authorize any amendment of the Corporation’s Certificate of
Incorporation that would adversely affect the rights of the holders of Preferred Stock;

19
(b) Authorize, create, or issue any equity securities of the Corporation
ranking senior to, or on a parity with, the Preferred Stock;

(c) Declare or pay dividends on or make other distributions with
respect to any securities other than Preferred Stock;

(d) Amend, alter or repeal the preferences, special rights or other
powers of the Preferred Stock so as to affect adversely the Preferred Stock;

(e) Incur any debt for borrowed money, except for bank loans, loans
from institutional or other third party lenders, equipment leases and similar agreements in the
ordinary and usual course of business not exceeding $250,000 in the aggregate; and

(f) Make any loans to or investments in, or guaranteeing the
indebtedness of any partially owned subsidiaries, joint ventures, or partnerships.

Any such act or transaction entered into without such consent or vote shall be null and
void ab initio and of no force or effect.

8. Certain Matters Requiring Consent of Holders of Series C Preferred Stock,
Series F Preferred Stock and Series G Preferred Stock.

(a) So long as any shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall be
outstanding, the Corporation shall not, without first obtaining the affirmative vote or written
consent of the holders of not less than seventy percent (70.0%) of the outstanding shares of
Series C Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, reduce (whether by merger, recapitalization
or otherwise) the original per share price of Series C Preferred Stock below $1.8905 (except for a
reduction in such amount that results from a stock dividend, stock split, combination or other
similar recapitalization which stock dividend, stock split, combination or other similar
recapitalization shall only require such approval otherwise necessary at law and under the
provisions of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation other than this
Section B.8(a)) and reduce the Series C Distribution Amount that a holder of Series C Preferred
Stock is otherwise entitled to under Section B.2 to an amount below what it was immediately
prior to such corporate action. Any such act or transaction entered into without such consent or
vote shall be null and void ab initio and of no force or effect.

(b) So long as any shares of Series F Preferred Stock shall be
outstanding, the Corporation shall not, without first obtaining the affirmative vote or written
consent of the holders of not less than seventy percent (70.0%) of the outstanding shares of
Series F Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, reduce (whether by merger, recapitalization
or otherwise) the original per share price of Series F Preferred Stock below $1.5855 (except for a
reduction in such amount that results from a stock dividend, stock split, combination or other
similar recapitalization which stock dividend, stock split, combination or other similar
recapitalization shall only require such approval otherwise necessary at law and under the
provisions of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation other than this
Section B.8(b)) and reduce the distribution amount that a holder of Series F Preferred Stock is
otherwise entitled to under Section B.2 upon a Liquidation Event to an amount below what it

20
was immediately prior to such corporate action. Any such act or transaction entered into without
such consent or vote shall be null and void ab initio and of no force or effect.
