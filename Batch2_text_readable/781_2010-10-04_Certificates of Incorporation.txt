Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of each share of Series C Preferred Stock shall be
equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the Series C Purchase Price by (ii) the Series C

Price with respect to the Series C Preferred Stock under Section B.4(c), the following shall be
applicable:

(i) Issuance of Convertible Securities.

(A)If the Corporation in any manner grants, issues or sells
any Convertible Securities, whether or not the rights to exercise, convert or exchange any such
Convertible Securities are immediately exercisable, and the price per share for which Common
Stock is issuable upon such exercise, conversion or exchange is less than the Conversion Price in
effect immediately prior to the time of such grant, issue or sale, then the maximum number of
shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the Corporation
at the time of the grant, issue or sale of such Convertible Securities for such price per share.

(B) For the purposes of this paragraph, the “price per share
for which Common Stock is issuable” in connection with the issuance of Convertible Securities
shall be determined by dividing (x) the total amount received or receivable by the Corporation as
consideration for the grant, issue or sale of such Convertible Securities, plus the cumulative
minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to the Corporation upon
the exercise, conversion or exchange thereof and, if applicable, the exercise, conversion and
exchange of any other Convertible Securities that such Convertible Securities may be converted
into or exercised or exchanged for (in each case, as set forth in the instruments and agreements
relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of
such consideration), by (y) the total maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
the exercise, conversion or exchange of all such Convertible Securities (as set forth in the
instruments and agreements relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein
for a subsequent adjustment of such number). No further adjustment of the Conversion Price
Shall be made when Common Stock and, if applicable, any other Convertible Securities, are
actually issued upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities.

(C) If the Corporation issues any Convertible Securities that
entitle the holder thereof, inter alia, both (i) to exercise, convert or exchange the same into or for
Common Stock or otherwise to participate with the holders of Common Stock in distributions
upon the occurrence of a Liquidation Event and (ii) in connection with or following such
exercise, conversion or exchange, to receive payment of a fixed or defined sum (such securities
being referred to herein as “Qualified Convertible Securities” and such fixed or defined sum
being referred to as the “Preference Payment”), the “total maximum number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of all such Convertible
Securities” for purposes of clause 6) of Section B.4(e)(i)(B) above shall include, in addition to
the total maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or
exchange of all such Convertible Securities, a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the
quotient of (A) the aggregate Preference Payments of all such Qualified Convertible Securities so
issued, divided by (B)the total amount received or receivable by the Corporation as
consideration for the issue of one of such Qualified Convertible Securities (as set forth in the
instruments and agreements relating thereto).

(ii) Change in Exercise Price or Conversion Rate. If the
additional consideration payable to the Corporation upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of
any Convertible Securities, or the rate at which any Convertible Securities are convertible into or
exchangeable for Common Stock should change at any time, the Conversion Price that is in
effect at the time of such change that was adjusted in accordance with Section B.4(e)(i) upon the
issuance of such Convertible Securities shall be readjusted to the Conversion Price that would
have been in effect at such time had such Convertible Securities that are stil! outstanding
provided for such changed additional consideration or changed conversion Tate, as the case may
be, at the time such Convertible Securities were initially granted, issued or sold; and on the
termination date of any right to exercise, convert or exchange such Convertible Securities

never been issued.

(iii) | Exceptions for Excluded Securities, Notwithstanding the

foregoing, no adjustments shal] be made under Sections B.4(c), (d) and/or (e) with respect to the
issue, grant or sale of any Excluded Securities,

or any other Convertible Securities that such Convertible Securities may be converted into or
exercised or exchanged for shall be computed in accordance with Section B.2(d).

this Section B.4 shall be construed liberally, mutatis mutandis, in order to provide the holders of
Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series B-2 Preferred Stock and Series C
