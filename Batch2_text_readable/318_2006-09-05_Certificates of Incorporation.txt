(3) If the Corporation i in any manner issues or grants any options,
warrants or similar rights to purchase or acquire (“Options”) either Common Stock or securities
convertible or exchangeable, with or without consideration, into or for Common Stock (“Convertible
Securities”) and the price per share for which Common Stock is issuable upon the exercise of sich
Options or upon conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities issuable upon the exercise of
such Options is less than the Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock in offect
immediately prior to the time of the granting of such Options, then the total maximum number of
shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Options or upon conversion or exchange
of the total maximum amount of such Convertible Securities issuable upon the exercise of such
Options will be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the Corporation for

such price per share. For purposes of this paragraph, the “price per share for which Common Stock
is issuable” will be determined by dividing:

(a) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the
Corporation as consideration for the granting of such Options, plus the minimum aggregate amount

407 s488,§.000 9
of additional consideration payable to the Corporation upon exercise of all such Options, plus, in the
case of such Options which relate to Convertible Securities, the minimum aggregate amount of
additional consideration, if any, payable to the Corporation upon the issuance or sale of such
Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange thereof; by

(b) the total maximum number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon the exercise of such Options and/or upon the conversion or exchange of all such
Convertible Securities issuable upon the exercise of such Options.

No figther adjustment of the Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock will be made when
Convertible Securities are actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or when Common Stock .
is actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities issuable upon the exercise of such Options.

(ii) If the Corporation in any manner issues or sells any
Convertible Securities and the price per share for which Common Stock is issuable upon such
conversion or exchange is less than the Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock in effect
immediately prior to the time of such issus or sale, then the maximum number of shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities will be deemed to be
outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the Corporation for such price per share. For the
purposes of this paragraph, the “price per share for which Common Stock’is issuable” will be
determined by dividing:

(a) the total amount received or receivable by the Corporation
ag consideration for the issue or sale of such Convartible Securities, plus the minimum aggregate
amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to the Corporation upon the conversion or
exchange thereaf; by

(b) the total maximum number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon the conversion or exchange of all such Convertible Securitics.

No further adjustmient of the Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock will be made when
Common Stock is actually issued upon the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities.

(iii) If (a) the purchase price provided for in any Options, (b) the
additional consideration, if any, payable upon the conversion or exchange of any Convertible
Securities or (c) the rate at which any Convertible Securities are convertible into or exchangeable for
Common Stock changes at any time, then the Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock in
effect at the time of such change will be readjusted to the Conversion Price for any series of
Preferred Stock which would kave been in effect at such timo had such Options or Convertible
Securities still outstanding provided for such changed purchase price, additional or leaser

consideration or changed conversion rate, as the case may be, at the time initially granted, issued or
sold. .

(iv) | Upon the expiration of any Option or the termination of any
right to convert or exchange any Convertible Security without the exercise of any such Option or
right or the conversion or exchange of any such Convertible Security, the Conversion Price for each
series of Preferred Stock then in effect hereunder will be adjusted to the Conversion Price for such
series of Preferred Stock which would have been in effect at the time of such expiration or
termination had such Option or Convertible Security, to the extent outstanding immediately prior to
such expiration or termination, never been issued.

(v)  (fany Common Stock, Option or Convertible Security is issued
or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold for cash, the consideration received therefor will be
deemed to be the.net amount received by the Corporation therefor. In case any Common Stock,
Options or Convertible Securities are issued or sold for a consideration other than cash, the amount
of the consideration other than cash received by the Corporation will be the Fair Market Value
thereof as of the date of receipt. If any Common Stock, Option or Convertible Security is issued in
connection with any merger in which the Corporation is the surviving corporation, the amount of
consideration therefor will be deemed to be the Fair Market Valuc of such portion of the net assets
and business of the non-surviving corporation as is attributable to such Common Stock, Options or
Convertible Securities, as the case may be.

(vi) In case any Option i is issued in connection with the issue or sale
of other securities of the Corporation, together comprising one integrated transaction in which no
specific consideration is allocated to such Option by the parties thereto, the Option will be deemed to
have-been issued for a consideration of $0.01.

(vii) The qumber of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any
given time does not include shares owned or held by or for the account of the Corporation or any
Subsidiary, and the disposition of any shares so owned or held will be considered an issue or sale of
Couumon Stock.

Stock for the purpose of entitling them (a) to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in
Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities or (b) to subscribe for or purchase Common
Stock, Options or Convertible Securities, then such record date will be deemed to be the date of the
issue or sale of the shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued or sold upon the
declaration of such dividend or upon the making of such other distribution or the date of the granting
of such right of subscription or purchase, as the case may be.

5D. Subdivision or Combination of Common Stock. Ifthe Corporation at
any time subdivides (by any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or otherwise) one or more
classes of its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, the Conversion
Price -then in effect for such Preferred Stock immediately prior to such subdivision will be
proportionately reduced, and if the Corporation at any time combines (by reverse stock split or
