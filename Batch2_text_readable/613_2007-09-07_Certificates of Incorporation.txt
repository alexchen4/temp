(a) Right to Convert Preferred Stock.

LIBC/3110136.2
(i) Series C Preferred Stock. Each share of Series C Preferred Stock
shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time and from time to time, and
without the payment of additional consideration by the holder thereof, into such number of fully
paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing $0.114131 by the
Series C Conversion Price (as defined below) in effect at the time of conversion. The “Series C
Conversion Price” shall initially be equal to the Series C Original Purchase Price. Such initial
Series C Conversion Price, and the rate at which shares of Series C Preferred Stock may be
converted into shares of Common Stock, shall be subject to adjustment as provided below.

In the event of a notice of redemption of any shares of Series C Preferred Stock pursuant
to Section 6 hereof, the Conversion Rights of the shares designated for redemption shall
terminate at the close of business on the last full day preceding the date fixed for redemption,
unless the redemption price is not paid on such redemption date, in which case the Conversion
Rights for such shares shall continue until such price is paid in full. In the event of a liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation or a Deemed Liquidation Event, the Conversion
Rights shall terminate at the close of business on the last full day preceding the date fixed for the
payment of any such amounts distributable on such event to the holders of Series C Preferred
Stock.

(ii) Series B Preferred Stock. Each share of Series B Preferred Stock
shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time and from time to time, and
without the payment of additional consideration by the holder thereof, into such number of fully
paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing $0.515 by the
Series B Conversion Price (as defined below) in effect at the time of conversion. The “Series B
Conversion Price” shall initially be equal to the Series B Orginal Purchase Price. Such initial
Series B Conversion Price, and the rate at which shares of Series B Preferred Stock may be
converted into shares of Common Stock, shall be subject to adjustment as provided below.

In the event of a notice of redemption of any shares of Series B Preferred Stock pursuant
to Section6 hereof, the Conversion Rights of the shares designated for redemption shall
terminate at the close of business on the last full day preceding the date fixed for redemption,
unless the redemption price is not paid on such redemption date, in which case the Conversion
Rights for such shares shall continue until such price is paid in full. In the event of a liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation or a Deemed Liquidation Event, the Conversion
Rights shall terminate at the close of business on the last full day preceding the date fixed for the
payment of any such amounts distributable on such event to the holders of Series B Preferred
Stock.

(iii) | Series A Preferred Stock. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock
shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time and from time to time, and
without the payment of additional consideration by the holder thereof, into such number of fully
paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing $1.00 by the
Series A Conversion Price (as defined below) in effect at the time of conversion. The ‘Series A
Conversion Price” shall initially be equal to the Series A Original Purchase Price. Such initial
Series A Conversion Price, and the rate at which shares of Series A Preferred Stock may be
converted into shares of Common Stock, shall be subject to adjustment as provided below.

LIBC/3110136.2
In the event of a notice of redemption of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant
to Section 6 hereof, the Conversion Rights of the shares designated for redemption shall
terminate at the close of business on the last full day preceding the date fixed for redemption,

Rights for such shares shal! continue until such price is paid in full. In the event of a liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation or a Deemed Liquidation Event, the Conversion
Rights shall terminate at the close of business on the last full day preceding the date fixed for the
payment of any such amounts distributable on such event to the holders of Series A Preferred
Stock.

(b) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued
upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred
Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the
Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair market value of a share of
Common Stock as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.
Whether or not fractional shares would be issuable upon such conversion shall be determined on
the basis of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock the holder is at the time converting into
Common Stock and the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such
conversion.

14
LIBC/3110136.2
(c) Mechanics of Conversion.

(i) In order for a holder of Preferred Stock to voluntarily convert
shares of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the
certificate or certificates for such shares of Preferred Stock (or, if such registered holder alleges
that such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement
reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that
may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such
certificate), at the office of the transfer agent for the Preferred Stock (or at the principal office of
the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent), together with written notice
that such holder elects to convert all or any number of the shares of the Preferred Stock
represented by such certificate or certificates and, if applicable, any event on which such
conversion is contingent. Such notice shall state such holder’s name or the names of the
nominees in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock
to be issued. If required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be
endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory
to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or his, her or its attorney duly
authorized in writing. The close of business on the date of receipt by the transfer agent of such
certificates (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement) and notice (or by the Corporation if the
Corporation serves as its own transfer agent) shall be the time of conversion (the “Conversion
Time’), and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the shares represented by
such certificate shall be deemed to be outstanding of record as of such date. The Corporation
shall, as soon as practicable after the Conversion Time, issue and deliver at such office to such
holder of Preferred Stock, or to his, her or its nominees, a certificate or certificates for the
number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled, together with cash in
lieu of any fraction of a share.

(ii) | The Corporation shall at all times when the Preferred Stock shall
be outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued stock, for the
purpose of effecting the conversion of the Preferred Stock, such number of its duly authorized
shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all
outstanding Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of
Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of
the Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall take such corporate action as may be necessary to
increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall
be sufficient for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in reasonable efforts to
obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to this Certificate of
Incorporation. Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment reducing the Series C
Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or the Series A Conversion Price below the then par
value of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock,
Series B Preferred Stock or Series A Preferred Stock, as the case may be, the Corporation will
take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel. be necessary in order that the
Corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock
at such adjusted Series C Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series A Conversion
Price.

15

LIBC/3110136.2
(iii) | All shares of Preferred Stock which shall have been surrendered
for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all nghts with
respect to such shares, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and to vote, shall
immediately cease and terminate at the Conversion Time, except only the right of the holders
thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor and to receive payment of any
dividends declared but unpaid thereon. Any shares of Preferred Stock so converted shall be
retired and cancelled and shall not be reissued as shares of such series, and the Corporation
(without the need for stockholder action) may from time to time take such appropriate action as
may be necessary to either reduce the authorized number of shares of Preferred Stock
accordingly or reinstate such shares as undesignated Preferred Stock.

(iv) Upon any such conversion, no accrued but unpaid Senes C
Accruing Dividends, Series B Accruing Dividends or Series A Accruing Dividends will be paid
or converted. and instead shall be forfeited, and no adjustment to the Series C Conversion Price,
Series B Conversion Price or the Series A Conversion Price, as the case may be, shall be made
for any declared but unpaid dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock
or Series A Preferred Stock, as the case may be, surrendered for conversion or on the Common
Stock delivered upon conversion.

(v) | The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and other similar taxes
that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon
conversion of shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4. The Corporation shall not,
however. be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in
the issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in which the
shares of Preferred Stock so converted were registered, and no such issuance or delivery shal] be
made unless and until the person or entity requesting such issuance has paid to the Corporation
the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax
has been paid.

(d) Adjustments to the Applicable Conversion Price for Diluting Issuances.

(i) Special Definitions. For purposes of this Section 4, the following

of Common Stock issued or deemed to be issued by the Corporation is equal to or greater than
the applicable Conversion Price. in effect immediately prior to the issuance or deemed issuance
of such Additional Shares of Common Stock, or (b) prior to such issuance or deemed issuance,
the Corporation receives written notice from the holders of a majority of the then outstanding
shares of Series C Preferred Stock, at least two-thirds of the then outstanding shares of Series B
Preferred Stock or a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, in each
case as applicable, agreeing that no such adjustment shall be made as the result of the issuance or
deemed issuance of such Additional Shares of Common Stock.

(iii) Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock.

(A) If the Corporation at any time or from time to time
shall issue any Options or Convertible Securities (excluding Options or Convertible
Securities which, upon exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, would entitle the
holder thereof to receive Exempted Securities pursuant to Subsections 4(d)(i)(G)(I),

number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or
exchange of any such Option or Convertible Security or (2) any increase or decrease

LIBC/3110136.2
Series C Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series A Conversion Price,
as applicable. computed upon the original issue of such Option or Convertible
Security (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto) shall be
readjusted to such Series C Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series A
Conversion Price, as applicable, as would have obtained had such revised terms been
in effect upon the original date of issuance of such Option or Convertible Security.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment pursuant to this clause (B) shall have
the effect of increasing the Series C Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or
Series A Conversion Price, as applicable, to an amount which exceeds the lower of
(i) the Series C Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series A Conversion
Price, as applicable, on the original adjustment date, or (ii) the Series C Conversion
Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series A Conversion Price, as applicable, that
would have resulted from any issuances of Additional Shares of Common Stock

Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series A Conversion Price, as applicable, then in
effect. or because such Option or Convertible Security was issued before the Series C

applicable), are revised after Series C Original Issue Date, the Series B Original Issue
Date or Series A Original Issue Date, as applicable (either automatically pursuant to
the provisions contained therein or as a result of an amendment to such terms) to

Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series A Conversion Price, as applicable, shall
be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest one-hundredth of a
cent) determined in accordance with the following formula:

CP2=CP, * (A+B)+(A+C)

accrued interest;

insofar as it consists oT property other than cash, be
computed at the fair market value thereof at the
time of such issue, as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors of the Corporation; and

in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock
are issued together with other shares or securities or
other assets of the Corporation for consideration
which covers both, be the proportion of such
consideration so received, computed as provided in
clauses (I) and (II) above, as determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

(B) Options and Convertible _ Securities. The
consideration per share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of

outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series A Preferred
Stock as applicable, without a comparable subdivision of the Common Stock, the Series C
Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series A Conversion Price, as applicable, in
effect immediately before the combination or subdivision shall be proportionately increased so
that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series
shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in the aggregate number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding. Any adjustment under this subsection shall become effective at the close of
business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective.

(f) Adjustment for Certain Dividends and Distributions. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Series C Original Issue Date, Series B
Original Issue Date or Series A Original Issue Date, as applicable, shall make or issue, or fix a

other distribution payable on the Common Stock in additional shares of Common Stock, then
and in each such event the Series C Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series A
Conversion Price, as applicable, in effect immediately before such event shall be decreased as of
the time of such issuance or, in the event such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close
of business on such record date, by multiplying the Series C Conversion Price, Series B
Conversion Price or Series A Conversion Price. as applicable, then in effect by a fraction:

LIBC/3110136.2
(1) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of
business on such record date, and

(2) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of
business on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of
such dividend or distribution:

provided, however, that if such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend is not fully
paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the Series C Conversion
Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series A Conversion Price, as applicable, shall be
recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record date and thereafter the Series
C Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series A Conversion Price, as applicable, shall
be adjusted pursuant to this subsection as of the time of actual payment of such dividends or
distributions; and provided further, however, that no such adjustment shall be made if the holders
of Series C Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series A Preferred Stock, as applicable,
simultaneously receive (i) a dividend or other distribution of shares of Common Stock in a
number equal to the number of shares of Common Stock as they would have received if all
outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series A Preferred
Stock, as applicable, had been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event or (ii) a
dividend or other distribution of shares of Series C Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or
Series A Preferred Stock, as applicable, which are convertible, as of the date of such event, into

Common Stock being issued with respect to each share of Common Stock in such dividend or
distribution.

(g) Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Series C Original Issue Date, Series B

Series A Preferred Stock. as applicable, had been converted into Common Stock on the date of
such event.

(h) Adjustment for Merger or Reorganization, etc. Subject to the provisions
of Subsection 2(c), if there shall occur any reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,

or exchanged for securities, cash or other property (other than a transaction covered by

23

LIBC/3110136.2
Subsections (e), (f) or (g} of this Section 4), then, following any such reorganization.
recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger, each share of Series C Preferred Stock,
Series B Preferred Stock or Series A Preferred Stock. as applicable, shall thereafter be
convertible in lieu of the Common Stock into which it was convertible prior to such event into
the kind and amount of securities. cash or other property which a holder of the number of shares
of Common Stock of the Corporation issuable upon conversion of one share of Series C
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series A Preferred Stock, as applicable,

merger would have been entitled to receive pursuant to such transaction; and, in such case,
appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation) shall be made in the application of the provisions in this Section 4 with respect to
the rights and interests thereafter of the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock or Series A Preferred Stock, as applicable, to the end that the provisions set forth

and concurrently with, the consummation of the Qualified Financing, all shares of Series B

Preferred Stock except that (1) the conversion price of such series shall be fixed at the Series B
