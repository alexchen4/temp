affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation

10
against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft
or destruction of such certificate), at the office of the transfer agent for the Preferred Stock (or at
the principal office of the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent),
together with written notice that such holder elects to convert all or any number of the shares of
the Preferred Stock represented by such certificate or certificates and, if applicable, any event on
which such conversion is contingent. Such notice shall state such holder’s name or the names of
the nominees in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common
Stock to be issued. If required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall
be endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form
satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or his, her or its attorney
duly authorized in writing. The close of business on the date of receipt by the transfer agent (or
by the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent) of such certificates (or lost
certificate affidavit and agreement) and notice shall be the time of conversion (the “Conversion
Time”), and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the shares represented by
such certificate shall be deemed to be outstanding of record as of such date. The Corporation
shall, as soon as practicable after the Conversion Time, (i) issue and deliver to such holder of
Preferred Stock, or to his, her or its nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of full
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion in accordance with the provisions
hereof and a certificate for the number (if any) of the shares of Preferred Stock represented by
the surrendered certificate that were not converted into Common Stock, (ii) pay in cash such
amount as provided in Section 2.4(b) in lieu of any fraction of a share of Common Stock
otherwise issuable upon such conversion and (iii) pay all declared but unpaid dividends on the
shares of Preferred Stock converted.

(ii) Reservation of Shares. The Corporation shall at all times
when the Preferred Stock shall be outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized
but unissued capital stock, for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Preferred Stock,
such number of its duly authorized shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be
sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding Preferred Stock; and if at any time the
number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall take such
corporate action as may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common
Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including, without
limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary
amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation. Before taking any action which would cause an
adjustment reducing the Conversion Price of a particular series of Preferred Stock below the then
par value of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such series of Preferred
Stock, the Corporation will take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be
necessary in order that the Corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion Price.

(iii) Effect of Conversion. All shares of Preferred Stock which
shall have been surrendered for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be
outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares shall immediately cease and terminate at
the Conversion Time, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive shares of Common
Stock in exchange therefor, to receive payment in lieu of any fraction of a share otherwise
issuable upon such conversion as provided in Section 2.4(b) and to receive payment of any

11
dividends declared but unpaid thereon. Any shares of Preferred Stock so converted shall be
retired and cancelled and may not be reissued as shares of such series, and the Corporation may
thereafter take such appropriate action (without the need for stockholder action) as may be
necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Preferred Stock accordingly.

(iv) No Further Adjustment. Upon any such conversion, no
adjustment to the applicable Conversion Price shall be made for any declared but unpaid
dividends on the Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion or on the Common Stock delivered
upon conversion.

(v) Taxes. The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and
other similar taxes that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of
Common Stock upon conversion of shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 2.4. The
Corporation shall not, however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of
any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other
than that in which the shares of Preferred Stock so converted were registered, and no such
issuance or delivery shall be made unless and until the person or entity requesting such issuance
has paid to the Corporation the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of
the Corporation, that such tax has been paid.

(d) Adjustments to Series D Conversion Price for Diluting Issues.

(i) Special Definitions. For purposes of this Article Fourth,
the following definitions shall apply:

A. “Option” shall mean rights, options or warrants to

13
(ii) No Adjustment _of Series D Conversion Price. No
adjustment in the Series D Conversion Price shall be made as the result of the issuance or
deemed issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock if the Corporation receives written
notice from the holders of at least 85% of the then outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock
agreeing that no such adjustment shall be made as the result of the issuance or deemed issuance
of such Additional Shares of Common Stock (such notice waiving adjustment to the Series D
Conversion Price shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

(iii) Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock.

A, If the Corporation at any time or from time to time
after the Series D Original Issue Date shall issue any Options or Convertible Securities
(excluding Options or Convertible Securities which are themselves Exempted Securities) or shall
fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive any
such Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of shares of Common Stock
(as set forth in the instrument relating thereto, assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to
exercisability, convertibility or exchangeability but without regard to any provision contained
therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options
or, in the case of Convertible Securities and Options therefor, the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to be Additional Shares of Common Stock issued as of
the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of
business on such record date.

B. If the terms of any Option or Convertible Security,
the issuance of which resulted in an adjustment to the Series D Conversion Price pursuant to the
terms of Section 2.4(d)(iv), are revised as a result of an amendment to such terms or any other
adjustment pursuant to the provisions of such Option or Convertible Security (but excluding
automatic adjustments to such terms pursuant to anti-dilution or similar provisions of such
Option or Convertible Security) to provide for either (1) any increase or decrease in the number
of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion and/or exchange of any such
Option or Convertible Security or (2) any increase or decrease in the consideration payable to the
Corporation upon such exercise, conversion and/or exchange, then, effective upon such increase
or decrease becoming effective, the Series D Conversion Price computed upon the original issue
of such Option or Convertible Security (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect
thereto) shall be readjusted to such Series D Conversion Price as would have obtained had such
revised terms been in effect upon the original date of issuance of such Option or Convertible
Security. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no readjustment pursuant to this clause B shall have
the effect of increasing the Series D Conversion Price to an amount which exceeds the lower of
(i) the Series D Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the original adjustment made as a
result of the issuance of such Option or Convertible Security, or (it) the Series D Conversion
Price that would have resulted from any issuances of Additional Shares of Common Stock (other
than deemed issuances of Additional Shares of Common Stock as a result of the issuance of such
Option or Convertible Security) between the original adjustment date and such readjustment
date.

C. If the terms of any Option or Convertible Security
(excluding Options or Convertible Securities which are themselves Exempted Securities), the

14
issuance of which did not result in an adjustment to the Series D Conversion Price pursuant to
the terms of Section 2.4(d)(iv) (either because the consideration per share (determined pursuant
to Section 2.4(d)(v) of the Additional Shares of Common Stock subject thereto was equal to or
greater than the Series D Conversion Price then in effect, or because such Option or Convertible
Security was issued before the Series D Original Issue Date), are revised after the Series D
Original Issue Date as a result of an amendment to such terms or any other adjustment pursuant
to the provisions of such Option or Convertible Security (but excluding automatic adjustments to
such terms pursuant to anti-dilution or similar provisions of such Option or Convertible Security)
to provide for either (1) any increase in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
the exercise, conversion or exchange of any such Option or Convertible Security or (2) any
decrease in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion or
exchange, then such Option or Convertible Security, as so amended or adjusted, and the
Additional Shares of Common Stock subject thereto (determined in the manner provided in
Section 2.4(d)(ili)(A) shall be deemed to have been issued effective upon such increase or
decrease becoming effective.

D. Upon the expiration or termination of any
unexercised Option or unconverted or unexchanged Convertible Security (or portion thereof)
which resulted (either upon its original issuance or upon a revision of its terms) in an adjustment
to the Series D Conversion Price pursuant to the terms of Section 2.4(d)(iv), the Series D
Conversion Price shall be readjusted to such Series D Conversion Price as would have obtained
had such Option or Convertible Security (or portion thereof) never been issued.

E. If the number of shares of Common Stock issuable
upon the exercise, conversion and/or exchange of any Option or Convertible Security, or the
consideration payable to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion and/or exchange, is
calculable at the time such Option or Convertible Security is issued or amended but is subject to
adjustment based upon subsequent events, any adjustment to the Series D Conversion Price
provided for in this Section 2.4(d)(iii) shall be effected at the time of such issuance or
amendment based on such number of shares or amount of consideration without regard to any
provisions for subsequent adjustments (and any subsequent adjustments shall be treated as
provided in clauses (B) and (C) of this Section 2.4(d)(iii). If the number of shares of Common
Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion and/or exchange of any Option or Convertible
Security, or the consideration payable to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion and/or
exchange, cannot be calculated at all at the time such Option or Convertible Security is issued or
amended, any adjustment to the Series D Conversion Price that would result under the terms of
this 2.4(d)(iii) at the time of such issuance or amendment shall instead be effected at the time
such number of shares and/or amount of consideration is first calculable (even if subject to
subsequent adjustments), assuming for purposes of calculating such adjustment to the Series D
Conversion Price that such issuance or amendment took place at the time such calculation can
first be made.

(iv) Adjustment of Series D Conversion Price Upon Issuance of
Additional Shares of Common Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the

Series D Original Issue Date issue Additional Shares of Common Stock (including Additional
Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to Section 2.4(d)(iii), without
consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Series D Conversion Price in effect

15
immediately prior to such issue, then the Series D Conversion Price shall be reduced,
concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent)
determined in accordance with the following formula:

CP, =CPi* (A+B)+(A+C).
For purposes of the foregoing formula, the following definitions shall apply:

A. “CP,” shall mean the Series D Conversion Price in
effect immediately after such issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock

B. “CP,” shall mean the Series D Conversion Price in
effect immediately prior to such issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock;

C. “A” shall mean the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock
(treating for this purpose as outstanding all shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
Options outstanding immediately prior to such issue or upon conversion or exchange of
Convertible Securities (including the Series D Preferred Stock) outstanding (assuming exercise
of any outstanding Options therefor) immediately prior to such issue);

D. “B” shall mean the number of shares of Common
Stock that would have been issued if such Additional Shares of Common Stock had been issued
at a price per share equal to CP; (determined by dividing the aggregate consideration received by
the Corporation in respect of such issue by CP)); and

E. “C” shall mean the number of such Additional
Shares of Common Stock issued in such transaction.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this
Section 2.4(d), the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional
Shares of Common Stock shall be computed as follows:

A. Cash and Property: Such consideration shall:

(i) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
agpregate amount of cash received by the
Corporation, excluding amounts paid or payable
for accrued interest;

(ii) insofar as it consists of property other than cash,
be computed at the fair market value thereof at
the time of such issue, as determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation; and

(iil) in the event Additional Shares of Common
Stock are issued together with other shares or

16
securities or other assets of the Corporation for
consideration which covers both, be the
proportion of such consideration so received,
computed as provided in clauses (i) and (ii)
above, as determined in good faith by the Board
of Directors of the Corporation.

B. Options and Convertible _ Securities. The
consideration per share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock
deemed to have been issued pursuant to Section 2.4(d)(iii), relating to Options and Convertible
Securities, shall be determined by dividing

the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Corporation as consideration for the issue
of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional
consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision
contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration) payable to the Corporation
upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities,
or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options for Convertible
Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, by the maximum
number of shares of Common Stock (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without
regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable
upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities,
or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options for Convertible
Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities.

(vi) Multiple Closing Dates. In the event the Corporation shall
issue on more than one date Additional Shares of Common Stock that are a part of one
transaction or a series of related transactions and that would result in an adjustment to the Series
D Conversion Price pursuant to the terms of Section 2.4(d){iv), and such issuance dates occur
within a period of no more than 90 days from the first such issuance to the final such issuance,
then, upon the final such issuance, the Series D Conversion Price shall be readjusted to give
effect to all such issuances as if they occurred on the date of the first such issuance (and without
giving effect to any additional adjustments as a result of any such subsequent issuances within
such period).

(e) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If the Corporation
shall at any time or from time to time after the Series D Original Issue Date effect a subdivision
of the outstanding Common Stock, the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock in
effect immediately before that subdivision shall be proportionately decreased so that the number
of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be
increased in proportion to such increase in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding. If the Corporation shall at any time or from time to time after the Series D Original
Issue Date combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price of each
series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately before the combination shall be proportionately
increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of
such series shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in the aggregate number of shares

17
of Common Stock outstanding. Any adjustment under this subsection shall become effective at
the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective.

(f) Adjustment for Certain Dividends and Distributions. In the event
the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Series D Original Issue Date shall
make or issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to
receive, a dividend or other distribution payable on the Common Stock in additional shares of
Common Stock, then and in each such event the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred
Stock in effect immediately before such event shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance
or, in the event such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such
record date, by multiplying the Conversion Price of the applicable series of Preferred Stock then
in effect by a fraction:

(1) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares
of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the
close of business on such record date, and

(2) the denominator of which shall be the total number of
shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance
or the close of business on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable
in payment of such dividend or distribution.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) if such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend is
not fully paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the Conversion
Price of such series of Preferred Stock shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of
business on such record date and thereafter the Conversion Price of such series of Preferred
Stock shall be adjusted pursuant to this subsection as of the time of actual payment of such
dividends or distributions; and (b) that no such adjustment shall be made if the holders of such
series of Preferred Stock simultaneously receive a dividend or other distribution of shares of
Common Stock in a number equal to the number of shares of Common Stock as they would have
received if all outstanding shares of such series of Preferred Stock had been converted into
Common Stock on the date of such event.

(g) Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. In the event
the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Series D Original Issue Date shall
make or issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to
receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the Corporation (other than a
distribution of shares of Common Stock in respect of outstanding shares of Common Stock) or in
other property and the provisions of Section 2.1 do not apply to such dividend or distribution,
then and in each such event the holders of Preferred Stock shall receive, simultaneously with the
distribution to the holders of Common Stock, a dividend or other distribution of such securities
or other property in an amount equal to the amount of such securities or other property as they
would have received if all outstanding shares of such series of Preferred Stock had been
converted into Common Stock on the date of such event.

(h) Adjustment for Merger or Reorganization, etc. Subject to the

provisions of Section 2.2, if there shall occur any reorganization, recapitalization,

18
reclassification, consolidation or merger involving the Corporation in which the Common Stock
(but not the Preferred Stock) is converted into or exchanged for securities, cash or other property
(other than a transaction covered by Subsections (d), (f) or (g)), then, following any such
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger, each share of Preferred
Stock shall thereafter be convertible in lieu of the Common Stock into which it was convertible
prior to such event into the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property which a holder
of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation issuable upon conversion of one
share of Preferred Stock immediately prior to such reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, consolidation or merger would have been entitled to receive pursuant to such
transaction; and, in such case, appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith by the Board
of Directors of the Corporation) shall be made in the application of the provisions in this Section
2.4 with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the holders of the Preferred Stock, to the
end that the provisions set forth in this Section 2.4 (including provisions with respect to changes
in and other adjustments of the Conversion Price) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as
reasonably may be, in relation to any securities or other property thereafter deliverable upon the
conversion of the Preferred Stock.

(i) Certificate _as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each
adjustment or readjustment of the applicable Conversion Price, as the case may be, pursuant to
this Section 2.4, the Corporation at its expense shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable but in
any event not later than 15 days thereafter, compute such adjustment or readjustment in
accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate
setting forth such adjustment or readjustment (including the kind and amount of securities, cash
or other property into which the Preferred Stock is convertible) and showing in detail the facts
upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the written request at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock (but
in any event not later than 10 days thereafter), furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a
certificate setting forth (i) the applicable conversion price then in effect, and (ii) the number of
shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other securities, cash or property which then
would be received upon the conversion of such Preferred Stock.

(j) Notice of Record Date. In the event:

A. the Corporation shall take a record of the holders of
its Common Stock (or other capital stock or securities at the time issuable upon conversion of the
Preferred Stock) for the purpose of entitling or enabling them to receive any dividend or other
distribution, or to receive any right to subscribe for or purchase any shares of capital stock of any
class or any other securities, or to receive any other security; or

B. of any capital reorganization of the Corporation,
any reclassification of the Common Stock of the Corporation, or any Deemed Liquidation Event;
or

C. of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution,
liquidation or winding-up of the Corporation,

19
then, and in each such case, the Corporation will send or cause to be sent to the holders of the
Preferred Stock a notice specifying, as the case may be, (i) the record date for such dividend,
distribution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right, or (ii)
the effective date on which such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer,
dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is proposed to take place, and the time, if any is to be
fixed, as of which the holders of record of Common Stock (or such other capital stock or
securities at the time issuable upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be entitled to
exchange their shares of Common Stock (or such other capital stock or securities) for securities
or other property deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger,
transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, and the amount per share and character of such
exchange applicable to the Preferred Stock and the Common Stock. Such notice shall be sent at
least 10 days prior to the record date or effective date for the event specified in such notice.

2.5 Mandatory Conversion.

(a) Trigger Events. Upon the closing of the sale of shares of Common
Stock to the public in a firm-commitment underwritten initial public offering pursuant to an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, resulting in at least
$40,000,000 of gross proceeds to the Corporation (the time of such closing is referred to herein
as the “Mandatory Conversion Time”), (i) all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall
automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock, at the then effective conversion rate
and (ii) such shares may not be reissued by the Corporation.

(b) Procedural Requirements. All holders of record of shares of
Preferred Stock shall be sent written notice of the Mandatory Conversion Time and the place
designated for mandatory conversion of all such shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this
Section 2.5. Such notice need not be sent in advance of the occurrence of the Mandatory
Conversion Time. Upon receipt of such notice, each holder of shares of Preferred Stock shall
surrender his, her or its certificate or certificates for all such shares (or, if such holder alleges that
such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement
reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that
may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such
certificate) to the Corporation at the place designated in such notice. If so required by the
Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by written
instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by
the registered holder or by his, her or its attorney duly authorized in writing. All rights with
respect to the Preferred Stock converted pursuant to Section 2.5(a), including the rights, if any, to
receive notices and vote (other than as a holder of Common Stock), will terminate at the
Mandatory Conversion Time (notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to
surrender the certificates at or prior to such time), except only the rights of the holders thereof,
upon surrender of their certificate or certificates (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement)
therefor, to receive the items provided for in the next sentence of this Section 2.5(b). As soon as
practicable after the Mandatory Conversion Time and the surrender of the certificate or
certificates (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement) for the Preferred Stock, the Corporation
shall issue and deliver to such holder, or to his, her or its nominees, a certificate or certificates
for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable on such conversion in accordance with
the provisions hereof, together with cash as provided in Section 2.4(b) in lieu of any fraction of a

20
share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion and the payment of any
declared but unpaid dividends on the shares of Preferred Stock converted. Such converted
Preferred Stock shall be retired and cancelled and may not be reissued as shares of such series,
and the Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate action (without the need for
stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Preferred
Stock accordingly.

Section 3. Common Stock

3.1 Voting Rights. Except as otherwise required by law or by this Certificate,
each share of Common Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to one vote on each matter
submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation, and the holders of shares of Common
Stock, Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series B-2 Preferred Stock, Series C
Preferred Stock, Series C-1 Preferred Stock, Series C-2 Preferred Stock, Series C-3 Preferred
Stock and Series D Preferred Stock shall vote together, on an as-converted basis, and not as

ARTICLE VII: LIABILITY

(a) The liability of the directors for monetary damages shall be
eliminated to the fullest extent under the Delaware General Corporation Law. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General
Corporation Law, a director of the Corporation shall not he personally liable to the Corporation
or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for
liability: ) for any breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its
stockholders; (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct
or a knowing violation of law; (iii) for any matter in respect of which such director shall he liable
under Section 174 of Title 8 of the Delaware General Corporation Law or any amendment

21
thereto or successor provision thereto; or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived
an improper personal benefit. If the Delaware General Corporation Law is amended to authorize
corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the
liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent
permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as so amended.

(b) | The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party
or is threatened to he made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative by reason of the fact that the
person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at
the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (each such person, an “Indemnity Claimant”),
against expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement
actually and reasonably incurred by the indemnity Claimant in connection with such action, suit
or proceeding if the Indemnity Claimant acted in good faith and in a manner the Indemnity
Claimant reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation,
and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the
Indemnity Claimant’s conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding
by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent,
shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the Indemnity Claimant did not act in good faith and
in a manner which the Indemnity Claimant reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the
best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had
reasonable cause to believe that the Indemnity Claimant’s conduct was unlawful.

(c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this Article VIII, the Corporation
shall indemnify any Indemnity Claimant who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a
party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit by or in the right of the Corporation to
procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that the Indemnity Claimant is or was a
director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and
reasonably incurred by the Indemnity Claimant in connection with the defense or settlement of
such action or suit (and any investigation related thereto) if the Indemnity Claimant acted in
good faith and in a manner the Indemnity Claimant reasonably believed to be in or not opposed
to the best interests of the Corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made in
respect of? any claim, issue or matter as to which the Indemnity Claimant shall have been
adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery
or the court in which such action or suit was brought shal! determine upon application that,
despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, the
Indemnity Claimant is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the
Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.

(d) Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or
proceeding shall (in the case of any action, suit or proceeding against a director or officer of the
Corporation) or may (in the case of any action, suit or proceeding against a trustee, employee or
agent) be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or
proceeding as authorized by the Board of Directors upon receipt of an undertaking by or on

22
behalf of the indemnified person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he
is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article VIII
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no advance shall be made by the Corporation if a determination
is reasonably and promptly made at a meeting duly held by a majority vote of disinterested
directors that, based upon the facts known to such disinterested directors at the time such
determination is made, either (i) the Indemnity Claimant did not act in good faith and in a
manner which the Indemnity Claimant reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best

and/or be subrogated to the extent of such advancement or payment to all of the rights of
recovery of the indemnitee against the Corporation; and (vi) any such third party or entity is an

reason of any Indemnified Fund Party’s status as a person who is or was a director, officer,
employee, agent or fiduciary of or consultant to the Corporation or of any other corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise that such person is or
was serving at the express written request of the Corporation or any claim, issue or matter
therein; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be responsible to an Indemnified Fund
Party with respect to any amounts payable pursuant to this Section (f) to the extent that a court of
competent jurisdiction shall have determined by a final judgment not subject to further appeal
- that such amounts payable resulted from actions taken or omitted to be taken by such
Indemnified Fund Party due to such Indemnified Fund Party’s gross negligence, bad faith or
willful misconduct. The Corporation shall advance all expenses reasonably incurred by or on
behalf of such Indemnified Fund Party in connection therewith within thirty (30) days after the
receipt by the Corporation of a statement or statements from such Indemnified Fund Party
requesting such advance payment or payments from time to time so long as such Indemnified
Fund Party has delivered to the Corporation a written undertaking pursuant to which such
Indemnified Fund Party agrees to return all advanced amounts in the event it is ultimately
determined that such Indemnified Fund Party is not entitled to indemnification under this Section
(f). The foregoing arrangements shall be in addition to any rights that any Indemnified Fund
Party may have under law or otherwise.

adoption of any provision of this Certificate inconsistent with this Article VIII, shall eliminate or
reduce the effect of this Article VIII in respect of any matter occurring before such amendment,
repeal or adoption of an inconsistent provision or in respect of any cause of action, suit or claim
relating to any such matter which would have given rise to a right of indemnification or right to
receive expenses pursuant to this Article VIII if such provision had not been so amended or
repealed or if a provision inconsistent therewith had not been so adopted. Notwithstanding any
other provision herein, any right or protection provided under this Article VIII shali be deemed
