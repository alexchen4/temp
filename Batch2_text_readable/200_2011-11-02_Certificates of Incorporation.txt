Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the “Effective Time’”’),
automatically and without any action by the holders thereof, each 340 shares of the
Corporation’s Common Stock, par value $.001 per share, outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the “Original Common Stock”) shall be reclassified and combined into one fully

B3931351.v4
paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock (as defined below) (the “Reverse Split”). All
shares of Original Common Stock held by any holder immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be aggregated for the purpose of determining the number of shares of Common Stock to
which such holder shall be entitled as a result of the Reverse Split. No fractional shares shall be
issued as a result of the Reverse Split. In lieu of any fractional shares of Common Stock to
which any holder would otherwise be entitled pursuant hereto (but for the preceding sentence),
such holder shall be entitled to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (A) the fair market
value of one share of Common Stock as determined by the Board of Directors of the Corporation
(the “Board of Directors’), and (B) such fractional shares of Common Stock to which such
holder would so otherwise be entitled pursuant hereto.

Regardless of when a holder delivers his, her or its certificates representing Original
Common Stock to the Corporation, such holder shail be deemed to have ceased to be a
stockholder of record of the shares of Original Common Stock previously held by him, her or it
that are so reclassified and combined hereunder as of the Effective Time, and such certificates
shall thereafter represent only the shares of Common Stock into which the Original Common
Stock theretofore represented by such certificates shall have been reciassified and combined
hereunder. The Corporation shall not be obligated to issue any certificate evidencing shares of
Common Stock or provide payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares resulting from the
Reverse Split unless the certificate that had previously evidenced the shares of Original Common
Stock in respect of which such shares of Common Stock were issued is either delivered to the
Corporation or its transfer agent, or the holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that
such certificate has been lost, stolen, or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the
Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such
certificate. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after delivery of any such certificate, or
such agreement and indemnification in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, issue
and deliver to such holder (A) a certificate or certificates representing the number of shares of
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled, if any, after giving effect to the Reverse Split
and (B) a check payable to such holder for any fractional shares to which such holder is entitled
resulting from the Reverse Split. Every share number, dollar amount, conversion rate and other
provision contained in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation has been adjusted
for the Reverse Split.

The total number of shares of all classes of stock which the Corporation shall have
authority to issue is (i) 25,000,000 shares of Common Stock, $.00025 par value per share
(“Common Stock”), and (ii) 21,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, $.001 par value per share
(“Preferred Stock’’), 11,000,000 of which shall be designated as Series A Preferred Stock (the
“Series A Preferred’) and 10,000,000 of which shall be designated as Series B Preferred Stock
(the “Series B Preferred”). The term “Preferred Stock” as used herein without reference to the
Series A Preferred or the Series B Preferred shall mean the Series A Preferred and the Series B
Preferred share for share alike and without distinction as to series, except as otherwise expressly
provided.

The preferences, voting powers, qualifications and special or relative rights or privileges
of the Common Stock and the Preferred Stock are as follows:
A. COMMON STOCK

l. General. The voting, dividend and liquidation rights of the holders of the
Common Stock are subject to and qualified by the rights, powers and preferences of the holders

Directors with respect to any series of Preferred Stock as authorized herein.

2. Voting. Except as otherwise required by law or this Certificate of Incorporation,
the holders of Common Stock will be entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be voted by
the stockholders of the Corporation. The number of authorized shares of Common Stock may be
increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the
affirmative vote of the holders of shares of capital stock of the Corporation representing a
majority of the votes represented by all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation
entitled to vote, irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the General Corporation
Law.

B. PREFERRED STOCK

any other shares of capital stock of the Corporation (other than dividends on shares of Common
Stock payable in shares of Common Stock) unless (in addition to the obtaining of any consents
required elsewhere in this Certificate of Incorporation) the holders of the Preferred Stock then
outstanding shall first receive, or simultaneously receive, a dividend on each outstanding share of
each series of Preferred Stock in an amount at least equal to that dividend per share of Preferred
Stock as would equal the product of (A) the dividend payable on each share of such Common
Stock or such class or series of capital stock convertible into Common Stock determined, if
applicable, as if all shares of such class or series had been converted into Common Stock and (2)
the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of a share of the applicable
series of Preferred Stock, in each case calculated on the record date for determination of holders
entitled to receive such; provided that, if the Corporation declares, pays or sets aside, on the
same date, a dividend on shares of more than one class or series of capital stock of the
Corporation, the dividend payable to the holders of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 1

result in the highest Preferred Stock dividend.

2. Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding-Up; Certain Mergers. Consolidations and
Asset Sales.

(a) Preferential Payments to Holders of Series B Preferred. In the event of any
voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation, including a
Deemed Liquidation Event as defined below (a “Liquidation Event’), the holders of shares of
Series B Preferred then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid out of the assets available for
distribution to its stockholders, and before any payment shall be made to the holders of Common
Stock or Series A Preferred by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount per share equal to
the Original Issue Price of the Series B Preferred, together with any dividends declared but
unpaid thereon. If upon any such Liquidation Event, the assets or surplus funds available for
distribution to its stockholders shall be insufficient to pay the holders of shares of Series B

Preferred their full preferential amount under this Subsection 2(a), the holders of shares of Series
B Preferred shall share ratably in any distribution of the assets available for distribution in
proportion to the respective amounts which would otherwise be payable in respect of the shares
held by them upon such distribution if all amounts payable on or with respect to such shares
were paid in full. The “Original Issue Price” of each of the Series B Preferred and the Series A
Preferred shall be $1.00, subject in each case to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock
dividend, stock split, combination or similar recapitalization with respect to such series of Series
B Preferred.

(b) Preferential Payments to Holders of Series A Preferred. In the event of any
Liquidation Event, after the holders of Series B Preferred have been paid their full preferential
amount pursuant to Subsection 2(a), the holders of shares of Series A Preferred then outstanding
shall be entitled to be paid out of the assets available for distribution to its stockholders, and
before any payment shall be made to the holders of Common Stock by reason of their ownership
thereof, an amount per share equal to (i) two times the Original Issue Price of the Series A
Preferred, plus (ii) any dividends declared but unpaid thereon. If upon any such Liquidation
Event, the assets or surplus funds available for distribution to its stockholders, after the holders
of Series B Preferred have been paid their full preferential amount pursuant to Subsection 2(a),
shall be insufficient to pay the holders of shares of Series A Preferred their full preferential
amount under this Subsection 2(b), the holders of shares of Series A Preferred shall share ratably
in any distribution of the assets available for distribution in proportion to the respective amounts
which would otherwise be payable in respect of the shares held by them upon such distribution if
all amounts payable on or with respect to such shares were paid in full.

(c) Distribution of Remaining Assets. In the event of a Liquidation Event, after the
payment of all preferential amounts required to be paid to the holders of shares of Preferred
Stock under Subsection 2(a) and Subsection 2(b) the remaining assets available for distribution
to the Corporation’s stockholders shall be distributed among the holders of the shares of
Common Stock pro rata based on the number of shares of Common Stock held by each such
holder; provided, however, that in the event the holders of shares of a series of Preferred Stock
would, if such shares were converted into Common Stock immediately prior to such Liquidation
Event, be entitled to receive under this Subsection 2(c) in respect of such shares of Common
Stock an amount greater than the amount such holders would receive in respect of such shares of
Preferred Stock pursuant to Subsection 2(a) or Subsection 2(b), as applicable, then, in lieu of the
amount that would otherwise be payable in respect of such shares of such series of Preferred
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive an amount equal to that which would have been
distributable to them under this Subsection 2(c) in respect of the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon conversion of such shares of Preferred Stock had such shares been so converted
into Common Stock immediately prior to such Liquidation Event. The aggregate amount that a
holder of a share of a series of Preferred Stock is entitled to receive under Subsections 2(a), 2(b)
or 2(c) hereof, as applicable, is referred to herein as the “Liquidation Amount” of such share.

(d) Deemed Liquidation Events.

(i) The following events shali be deemed to be a liquidation of the
Corporation for purposes of this Section 2, unless holders of at least two-thirds of the issued and
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a separate class on an as-converted
basis (the “Required Holders”), elect otherwise by written notice given to the Corporation at
least 10 business days prior to the effective date of any such event (any such event, unless such
an election is made, is referred to herein as a “Deemed Liquidation Event’):

(A) | amerger or consolidation in which
(1) the Corporation is a constituent party or

(1 a subsidiary of the Corporation is a constituent party
and the Corporation issues shares of its capital stock
pursuant to such merger or consolidation,

except any such merger or consolidation involving the Corporation or a subsidiary in which the
shares of capital stock of the Corporation outstanding immediately prior to such merger or
consolidation continue to represent, or are converted or exchanged for shares of capital stock
which represent, immediately following such merger or consolidation, at least a majority, by
voting power, of the capital stock of (1) the surviving or resulting corporation or (2) if the
surviving or resulting corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary of another corporation
immediately following such merger or consolidation, the parent corporation of such surviving or
resulting corporation (provided that, for the purpose of this Subsection 2(d)(i), all shares of
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Options (as defined below) outstanding immediately
prior to such merger or consolidation or upon conversion of Convertible Securities (as defined
below) outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation shall be deemed to be
outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation and, if applicable, converted or
exchanged in such merger or consolidation on the same terms as the actual outstanding shares of
Common Stock are converted or exchanged);

(B) _ the sale, lease, license, transfer or other disposition, in a
single transaction or series of related transactions, by the Corporation or any subsidiary of the
Corporation of all or substantially all the assets of the Corporation and its subsidiaries taken as a
whole, except where such sale, lease, license, transfer or other disposition is to a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Corporation; or

(C) the closing of the transfer (whether by merger,
consolidation or otherwise), in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to a person or
group of affiliated persons (other than an underwriter of the Corporation’s securities), of the
Corporation’s securities if, after such closing, such person or group of affiliated persons would
hold 50% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the Corporation (or the surviving or
acquiring entity).

(ii) | The Corporation shall not have the power to effect any transaction
constituting a Deemed Liquidation Event pursuant to Subsection 2(d)(i)(A)() above unless the
agreement or plan of merger or consolidation provides that the consideration payable to the
stockholders of the Corporation shall be allocated among the holders of capital stock of the
Corporation in accordance with Section 2 above.
(iii) In the event of a Deemed Liquidation Event pursuant to Subsection
2(d)()(AJUD. 2(d)G)(B) or 2(d)(i)(C) above, if the Corporation does not effect a dissolution of
the Corporation under the General Corporation Law within 90 days after such Deemed
Liquidation Event, then (A) the Corporation shall deliver a written notice to each holder of
Preferred Stock no later than the 90" day after the Deemed Liquidation Event advising such
holders of their right (and the requirements to be met to secure such right) pursuant to the terms
of the following clause (B) to require the redemption of such shares of Preferred Stock, and (B)
the Corporation shall, unless otherwise requested in writing by the Required Holders, use the
consideration received by the Corporation for such Deemed Liquidation Event (net of any
retained liabilities associated with the assets sold or technology licensed, as determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation) (the “Net Proceeds”), to the extent legally
available therefor, to redeem, on the 120" day after such Deemed Liquidation Event, all
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock at a price per share equal to the Liquidation Amount of
such share. In the event of a redemption pursuant to the preceding sentence, if the Net Proceeds
are not sufficient to redeem all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, or if the Corporation does
not have sufficient lawfully available funds to effect such redemption, the Corporation shall
redeem first all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred, or if the Net Proceeds shall be
insufficient to pay the holders of Series B Preferred their full redemption amount hereunder, a
pro rata portion of each holder’s shares of Series B Preferred, to the fullest extent of such Net
Proceeds or such legally available funds, as the case may be, based on the respective amounts
which would otherwise be payable in respect of such shares if the Net Proceeds and legally
available funds were sufficient to redeem all such shares, and shall redeem the remaining shares
of Series B Preferred as soon as practicable after the Corporation has funds legally available
therefor; and second, after all shares of Series B Preferred have been redeemed in full, all
outstanding shares of Series A Preferred, or if the Net Proceeds shall be insufficient to pay the
holders of Series A Preferred their full redemption amount hereunder, a pro rata portion of each
holder’s shares of Series A Preferred, to the fullest extent of such Net Proceeds or such legally
available funds, as the case may be, based on the respective amounts which would otherwise be
payable in respect of such shares if the Net Proceeds and legally available funds were sufficient
to redeem all! such shares, and shall redeem the remaining shares of Series A Preferred as soon as
practicable after the Corporation has funds legally available therefor. The provisions of
Subsections 6(b) through 6(e) below shall apply, with such necessary changes in the details
thereof as are necessitated by the context, to the redemption of Preferred Stock pursuant to this
Subsection 2(d)(ii1). Prior to the distribution or redemption provided for in this Subsection
2(d)(iii), the Corporation shall not expend or dissipate the consideration received for such
Deemed Liquidation Event, except to discharge expenses incurred in connection with such
Deemed Liquidation Event or in the ordinary course of business.

(iv) The amount deemed paid or distributed to the holders of capital
stock of the Corporation upon any such Deemed Liquidation Event shall be the cash or the value
of the property, rights or securities paid or distributed to such holders by the Corporation or the
acquiring person, firm or other entity. Any securities shall be valued as follows:

(A) Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar
restrictions on free marketability:
(I) If traded on a securities exchange, the value shall be
the average closing price of the securities on such
exchange over the prior 30 days;

(II) ‘Lf actively traded over-the-counter, the value shail
be the average closing bid or sales price (whichever
is applicable) of such securities over the prior 30
days; and

(2D If there is no active public market, the value shall be
the fair market value thereof, as determined in good
faith by a Preferred Director Vote (as defined
below).

(B) The method of valuation of securities subject to investment
letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of
a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount
from the market value determined as specified above in Subsection 2(d)(iv)(A) to reflect the
approximate fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(e) Allocation of Escrow. In connection with any Deemed Liquidation Event, if any
portion of the consideration payable to the stockholders of the Corporation is placed into escrow
and/or is payable to the stockholders of the Corporation subject to contingencies (including,
without limitation, as part of an earn-out, upon the satisfaction of future milestones, any deferred
purchase price payments, installment payments, payments made in respect of any promissory
note issued in such transaction, purchase price adjustment payments or payments in respect of
holdbacks), the acquisition or merger agreement shall provide that (a) the portion of such
consideration that is not placed in escrow and not subject to any contingencies (the “Initial
Consideration’) shall be allocated among the holders of capital stock of the Corporation in
accordance with Subsections 2(a), 2(b) and 2(c) above as if the Initial Consideration were the
only consideration payable in connection with such Deemed Liquidation Event and (b) any
additional consideration which becomes payable to the stockholders of the Corporation upon
release from escrow or satisfaction of contingencies shall be allocated among the holders of
capital stock of the Corporation in accordance with Subsections 2(a), 2(b) and 2(c) above after
taking into account the previous payment of the Initial Consideration as part of the same
transaction. The result of this approach is that, for certain transactions, the portion of the
transaction consideration that is subject to an escrow or other contingencies may be allocated
disproportionately (or even exclusively) to the holders of Common Stock.

3, Voting.

(a) On any matter presented to the stockholders of the Corporation for their action or
consideration at any meeting of stockholders of the Corporation (or by written consent of
stockholders in lieu of meeting), each holder of outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to cast the number of votes equal to the number of whole shares of Common Stock into
which the shares of Preferred Stock held by such holder are convertible as of the record date for
determining stockholders entitled to vote on such matter. Except as provided by law or in this
Certificate of Incorporation, holders of Preferred Stock shall vote together with the holders of
Common Stock as a single class.

(b) The holders of record of the shares of Preferred Stock, exclusively and voting
together as a separate class on an as-converted basis, shall be entitled to elect two director of the
Corporation (the “Preferred Directors”) and the holders of record of the shares of Common
Stock and Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class on an as-converted basis, shall be
entitled to elect the balance of the total number of directors of the Corporation. Any director
elected as provided in the preceding sentence may be removed without cause by, and only by, the
affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of the classes or series of stock entitled to elect such
director or directors, given either at a special meeting of such stockholders duly called for that
purpose or pursuant to a written consent of stockholders. At any meeting held for the purpose of
electing a director, the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of the class or series entitled to elect such director shall constitute a quorum
for the purpose of electing such director. A vacancy in any directorship filled by the holders of
any class or series shall be filled only by vote or written consent in lieu of a meeting of the
holders of such class or series or by any remaining director or directors elected by the holders of
such class or series pursuant to this Subsection 3(b).

(c) At any time when shares of Preferred Stock are outstanding, except where the
vote or written consent of the holders of a greater number of shares of the Corporation is
required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, and in addition to any other vote required
by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, without the written consent or affirmative vote of the
Required Holders, given in writing or by vote at a meeting, consenting or voting (as the case may
be), the Corporation shall not, either directly or by amendment, merger, consolidation or
otherwise:

(i) effect any Liquidation Event or any other merger, consolidation,
recapitalization or reorganization, or consent to any of the foregoing;

(ii) amend, alter, repeal or waive any provision of the Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws of the Corporation;

Stock and other than securities repurchased from former employees, officers, directors,
consultants or other persons who performed services for the Corporation or any subsidiary in
connection with the cessation of such employment or service at the lower of the original
purchase price or the then-current fair market value thereof or other than as approved by a
majority vote of the Board of Directors, which majority includes the affirmative vote of each
Preferred Director then serving (a “Preferred Director Vote’);

(iv) increase or decrease the authorized number of directors
constituting the Board of Directors;
(v) grant any exclusive license;

(vi) make any significant change in the nature of the Corporation’s
principal business or the proposed nature of the Corporation’s business or enter into new lines of

stock;

are approved by a Preferred Director Vote;

(xii1) create any subsidiary;

the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation and with respect to the payment of
dividends and redemption rights, or increase or decrease the authorized number of shares of any
class or series of shares of capital stock, or create or authorize any obligation or security

Preferred Stock with respect to the distribution of assets on the liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation and with respect to the payment of dividends and redemption

rights.

4, Optional Conversion.

The holders of Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as follows (the
“Conversion Rights’):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of each series of Preferred Stock shall be
convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time and from time to time, and without
the payment of additional consideration by the holder thereof, into such number of fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Original Issue Price of
such series of Preferred Stock by the Conversion Price (as defined below) of such series in effect
at the time of conversion. The “Conversion Price” of each of the Series B Preferred and the
Series A Preferred shall initially be equal to $1.00 and shall in each case be subject to adjustment
pursuant to Subsection 4(d)(iv). In the event of a notice of redemption of any shares of Preferred
Stock pursuant to Section 6 hereof, the Conversion Rights of the shares designated for
redemption shall terminate at the close of business on the last full day preceding the date fixed
for redemption, unless the redemption price is not fully paid on such redemption date, in which
case the Conversion Rights for such shares shall continue until such price is paid in full. In the
event of a Liquidation Event, the Conversion Rights shall terminate at the close of business on
the last full day preceding the date fixed fer the payment of any such amounts distributable in
such event to the holders of Preferred Stock.

(b) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon
conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would
otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair
market value of a share of Common Stock as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors
of the Corporation. Whether or not fractional shares would be issuable upon such conversion
shall be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock the holder is at
the time converting into Common Stock and the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion,

(c) Mechanics of Conversion.

(1) In order for a holder of Preferred Stock to voluntarily convert
shares of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the
certificate or certificates for such shares of Preferred Stock (or, if such registered holder alleges
that such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement
reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that
may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such
certificate), at the office of the transfer agent for the Preferred Stock (or at the principal office of
the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent), together with written notice

10
that such holder elects to convert all or any number of the shares of Preferred Stock represented
by such certificate or certificates and, if applicable, any event on which such conversion is
contingent. Such notice shall state such holder’s name or the names of the nominees in which
such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued. If
required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or
accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the
Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or his, her or its attorney duly authorized in
writing. The close of business on the date of receipt by the transfer agent (or by the Corporation
if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent) of such certificates (or lost certificate
affidavit and agreement) and notice shall be the time of conversion (the “Conversion Time’’),
and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the shares represented by such
certificate shall be deemed to be outstanding of record as of such date. The Corporation shall, as
soon as practicable after the Conversion Time, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of
Preferred Stock, or to his, her or its nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of
shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled, together with cash in lieu of any
fraction of a share and payment of any dividends declared but unpaid on the shares of Preferred
Stock converted.

(ii) | The Corporation shall at all times when Preferred Stock shall be
outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued stock, for the purpose
of effecting the conversion of Preferred Stock, such number of its duly authorized shares of
Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding
Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common
Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of Preferred
Stock, the Corporation shall take such corporate action as may be necessary to increase its
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient
for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite
stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation. Before
taking any action which would cause an adjustment reducing the Conversion Price of any series
of Preferred Stock below the then par value of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take any corporate action which may, in the
opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Corporation may validly and legally issue
fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion Price.

(iii) All shares of Preferred Stock which shall have been surrendered
for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights with
respect to such shares, including the rights as a holder of Preferred Stock, if any, to receive
notices and to vote with respect to the shares of Preferred Stock being converted, shall
immediately cease and terminate at the Conversion Time, except only the right of the holders
thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor and to receive payment of any
dividends declared but unpaid thereon. Any shares of Preferred Stock so converted shall be
retired and cancelled and shall not be reissued as shares of such series, and the Corporation
(without the need for stockholder action) may from time to time take such appropriate action as
may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Preferred Stock accordingly.

(iv) | Upon any such conversion, no adjustment to the Conversion Price
shall be made for any declared but unpaid dividends on any series of Preferred Stock surrendered

1]
for conversion or on the Common Stock delivered upon conversion, provided that such declared
but unpaid dividends are paid in cash.

(v) | The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and other similar taxes
that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon
conversion of shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4. The Corporation shall not,
however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in
the issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in which the
shares of Preferred Stock so converted were registered, and no such issuance or delivery shall be
made unless and until the person or entity requesting such issuance has paid to the Corporation
the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax
has been paid.

(d) Adjustments to Conversion Price for Diluting Issues.

(i) Special Definitions. For purposes of this Article Fourth, the
following definitions shall apply:

(A) “Option” shall mean rights, options or warrants to
subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire Common Stock or Convertible Securities.

(B) “Series B Original Issue Date” shall mean the date on
which the first share of Series B Preferred was issued.

(C) “Convertible Securities” shall mean any evidences of
indebtedness, shares or other securities directly or indirectly convertible into or exchangeable for
Common Stock, including the Preferred Stock, but excluding Options.

(D) ‘Additional Shares of Common Stock” shall mean all
shares of Common Stock issued (or, pursuant to Subsection 4(d)(iii) below, deemed to be issued)
by the Corporation after the Series B Original Issue Date, other than the following (“Exempted
Securities”):

(1) Shares of Series B Preferred and shares of Series A
Preferred issued pursuant to the Series B Preferred
Stock Purchase Agreement by and among the
Corporation and the Purchasers (as defined therein)
dated on or about the date of filing of this Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the
“Purchase Agreement”);

(il) — shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities
actually issued upon exercise or exchange of
Options and shares of Common Stock actually
issued upon conversion of Convertible Securities,
including without limitation shares of Common
Stock issued or issuable pursuant to an adjusted
Conversion Price in accordance with the provisions

12
of this Subsection 4(d), provided that (i) such
issuance is pursuant to the terms of such Option or
Convertible Security and (ii) and all adjustments to
the applicable Conversion Price resulting from the
issuance of such Options or Convertible Securities
have been made in accordance with Subsection

4(d);

(iif) shares of Common Stock issued or deemed issued
as a dividend or distribution on Preferred Stock;

(IV) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable by
reason of a dividend, stock split, split-up or other

(V) up to 3,692,678 shares of Common Stock (subject
to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock
dividend, stock split, combination or similar
recapitalization with respect to the Common Stock)
issued or deemed issued to employees or directors
of, or consultants to, the Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries pursuant to the Corporation’s 2005
Stock Incentive Plan, as amended, or any other
plan, agreement or arrangement (or amendment
thereto) approved by a Preferred Director Vote,
whether issued before or after the Series B Original
Issue Date.

(ii) No Adjustment of Conversion Price. No adjustment in the
Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock shall be made as the result of the issuance or
deemed issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock if prior to such issuance or deemed
issuance, the Corporation receives written notice from the Required Holders agreeing that no
such adjustment shall be made as the result of the issuance or deemed issuance of such
Additional Shares of Common Stock.

(iii) Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock.

(A) If the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the
Series B Original Issue Date shall issue any Options or Convertible Securities (excluding
Options or Convertible Securities which, upon exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, would
entitle the holder thereof to receive Exempted Securities pursuant to Subsection 4(d)(i)(D)(D),
GQ, (U1) or (V)) or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of
securities entitled to receive any such Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum
number of shares of Common Stock (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto, assuming the
satisfaction of any conditions to exercisability, convertibility or exchangeability but without
regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable

13
upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities and Options therefor,
the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to be Additional
Shares of Common Stock issued as of the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shall
have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date.

(B) If the terms of any Option or Convertible Security, the
issuance of which resulted in an adjustment to the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred
Stock pursuant to the terms of Subsection 4(d)(iv) below, are revised (either automatically
pursuant to the provisions contained therein or as a result of an amendment to such terms) to
provide for either (1) any increase or decrease in the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any such Option or Convertible Security
or (2) any increase or decrease in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon such
exercise, conversion or exchange, then, effective upon such increase or decrease becoming
effective, the Conversion Price or Conversion Prices computed upon the original issue of such
Option or Convertible Security (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto)
shall be readjusted to such Conversion Price or Conversion Prices as would have obtained had
such revised terms been in effect upon the original date of issuance of such Option or
Convertible Security. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no readjustment pursuant to this clause (B)
shall have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price with respect to any series of Preferred
Stock to an amount which exceeds the lower of (i) the applicable Conversion Price on the
original adjustment date, or (ii) the applicable Conversion Price that would have resulted from
any issuances of Additional Shares of Common Stock between the original adjustment date and
such readjustment date.

(C) If the terms of any Option or Convertible Security
(excluding Options or Convertible Securities which, upon exercise, conversion or exchange
thereof, would entitle the holder thereof to receive Exempted Securities pursuant to Subsection
4(d)G)(D)\(D. (ID, (HD or (V)), the issuance of which did not result in an adjustment to the
Conversion Price pursuant to the terms of Subsection 4(d)(iv) below (either because the
consideration per share (determined pursuant to Subsection 4(d)(v) hereof) of the Additional
Shares of Common Stock subject thereto was equal to or greater than the Conversion Price then
in effect with respect to any series of Preferred Stock, or because such Option or Convertible
Security was issued before the Series B Original Issue Date), are revised after the Series B
Original Issue Date (either automatically pursuant to the provisions contained therein or as a
result of an amendment to such terms) to provide for either (1) any increase or decrease in the
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any
such Option or Convertible Security or (2) any increase or decrease in the consideration payable
to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion or exchange, then such Option or Convertible
Security, as so amended, and the Additional Shares of Common Stock subject thereto
(determined in the manner provided in Subsection 4(d)(iii)(A) above) shall be deemed to have
been issued effective upon such increase or decrease becoming effective.

(D) Upon the expiration or termination of any unexercised
Option or unconverted or unexchanged Convertible Security which resulted (either upon its
original issuance or upon a revision of its terms) in an adjustment to the Conversion Price of any
series of Preferred Stock pursuant to the terms of Subsection 4(d)(iv) below, the Conversion

14
Price of such series shall be readjusted to such Conversion Price as would have obtained had
such Option or Convertible Security never been issued.

(iv) Adjustment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance _of Additional
Shares of Common Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Series B

Original Issue Date issue Additional Shares of Common Stock (including Additional Shares of
Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to Subsection 4(d)(iii)), without consideration or
for a consideration per share less than the Conversion Price of the Series B Preferred Stock, then
the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred stock with a Conversion Price greater than such
consideration per share shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to
the nearest one-hundredth of a cent) determined in accordance with the following formula:

CP) = CP, *(A+B)=(A+C).
For purposes of the foregoing formula, the following definitions shall apply:

(A) “CP,” shall mean the Conversion Price applicable to such
series in effect immediately after such issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock;

(B) “CP,” shall mean the Conversion Price applicable to such
series in effect immediately prior to such issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock;

(C) “A” shall mean the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock (treating for
this purpose as outstanding all shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Options
outstanding immediately prior to such issue or upon conversion or exchange of Convertible
Securities (including the Preferred Stock) outstanding (assuming exercise of any outstanding
Options therefor) immediately prior to such issue);

(D) “B” shall mean the number of shares of Common Stock
that would have been issuable if such Additional Shares of Common Stock had been issued at a
price per share equal to the Conversion Price of such series in effect immediately prior to such
issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock (determined by dividing the aggregate
consideration received by the Corporation in respect of such issue by the such Conversion Price);
and

(E)  “C” shall mean the number of such Additional Shares of
Common Stock issued in such transaction.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this
Subsection 4(d), the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional
Shares of Common Stock shall be computed as follows:

(A) | Cash and Property: Such consideration shall:

(4) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
aggregate amount of cash received by the

15
Corporation, excluding amounts paid or payable for
accrued interest;

(ID insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair market value thereof at the
time of such issue, as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors of the Corporation; and

(II) in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock
are issued together with other shares or securities or
other assets of the Corporation for consideration
which covers both, be the proportion of such
consideration so received, computed as provided in
clauses (1) and (II) above, as determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

(B) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per
share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been
issued pursuant to Subsection 4(d)(iii), relating to Options and Convertible Securities, shall be
determined by dividing

(1) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by
the Corporation as consideration for the issue of
such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the
minimum aggregate amount of additional
consideration (as set forth in the instruments
relating thereto, without regard to any provision
contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of
such consideration) payable to the Corporation upon
the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the
case of Options for Convertible Securities, the
exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities
and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, by

(I~ the maximum number of shares of Common Stock
(as set forth in the instruments relating thereto,
without regard to any provision contained therein
for a subsequent adjustment of such number)
issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities.

(v1) Multiple Closing Dates. In the event the Corporation shall issue on

more than one date Additional Shares of Common Stock that are a part of one transaction or a
series of related transactions and that would result in an adjustment to the Conversion Price of

16
any series of Preferred Stock pursuant to the terms of Subsection 4(d)(iv) above, and such
issuances occur within a period of no more than 30 days from the first such issuance to the final
such issuance, then, upon the final such issuance, the applicable Conversion Price shall be
readjusted to give effect to all such issuances as if they occurred on the date of the first such
issuance (and without giving effect to any additional adjustments as a result of any such
subsequent issuances within such period).

(e) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If the Corporation shall at any
time or from time to time after the Series B Original Issue Date effect a subdivision of the
outstanding Common Stock without a comparable subdivision of Preferred Stock or combine the
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock without a comparable combination of the Common Stock,
the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately before that
subdivision or combination shall be proportionately decreased so that the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be increased in
proportion to such increase in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. If
the Corporation shall at any time or from time to time after the Series B Original Issue Date
combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock without a comparable combination of the
Preferred Stock or effect a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock without a
comparable subdivision of the Common Stock, the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred
Stock in effect immediately before the combination or subdivision shall be proportionately
increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of
such series shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in the aggregate number of shares
of Common Stock outstanding. Any adjustment under this subsection shall become effective at
the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective.

(f) Adjustment for Certain Dividends and Distributions. In the event the Corporation
at any time or from time to time after the Series B Original Issue Date shall make or issue, or fix
a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or
other distribution payable on the Common Stock in additional shares of Common Stock, then
and in each such event the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock in effect
immediately before such event shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance or, in the event
such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, by
multiplying the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock then in effect by a fraction:

(1) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of
business on such record date, and

(2) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of
business on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of
such dividend or distribution;

provided, however, that if such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend is not fully
paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the Conversion Price of
each series of Preferred Stock shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on
such record date and thereafter the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock shall be

17
adjusted pursuant to this subsection as of the time of actual payment of such dividends or
distributions; and provided further, however, that no such adjustment shall be made if the holders
of Preferred Stock simultaneously receive a dividend or other distribution of shares of Common
Stock in a number equal to the number of shares of Common Stock they would have received if
all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock on the date of
such event.

(g) Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. In the event the Corporation
at any time or from time to time after the Series B Original Issue Date shall make or issue, or fix
a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or
other distribution payable in securities of the Corporation (other than a distribution of shares of
Common Stock in respect of outstanding shares of Common Stock) or in other property and the
provisions of Section 1 do not otherwise preclude such dividend or distribution, then and in each
such event the holders of Preferred Stock shall receive, simultaneously with the distribution to
the holders of Common Stock, a dividend or other distribution of such securities or other
property in an amount equal to the amount of such securities or other property as they would
have received if all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock had been converted into Common
Stock on the date of such event.

(h) Adjustment _for Merger or Reorganization, etc. Subject to the provisions of
Subsection 2(d), if there shall occur any reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,

consolidation or merger involving the Corporation in which the Common Stock (but not
Preferred Stock) is converted into or exchanged for securities, cash or other property (other than
a transaction covered by Subsection (e), (f) or (g) of this Section 4), then, following any such
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger, each share of Preferred
Stock shall thereafter be convertible in lieu of the Common Stock into which it was convertible
prior to such event into the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property which a holder
of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation issuable upon conversion of one
share of Preferred Stock immediately prior to such reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, consolidation or merger would have been entitled to receive pursuant to such
transaction; and, in such case, appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith by the Board
of Directors of the Corporation) shall be made in the application of the provisions in this
Section 4 with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the holders of Preferred Stock, to
the end that the provisions set forth in this Section 4 (including provisions with respect to
changes in and other adjustments of the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock) shall
thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any securities or other
property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock.

(i) Certificate _as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4,
the Corporation at its expense shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable but in any event not
later than 10 days thereafter, compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the
terms hereof and furnish to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such
adjustment or readjustment (including the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property
into which the Preferred Stock is convertible) and showing in detail the facts upon which such
adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the written request at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock (but in any

18
event not later than 10 days thereafter), furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a
certificate setting forth (i) the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock then in effect
and held by such holder, and (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any,
of other securities, cash or property which then would be received upon the conversion of
Preferred Stock.

(j) Notice of Record Date. In the event:

(i) the Corporation shall take a record of the holders of its Common
Stock (or other stock or securities at the time issuable upon conversion of Preferred Stock) for
the purpose of entitling or enabling them to receive any dividend or other distribution, or to
receive any right to subscribe for or purchase any shares of stock of any class or any other
securities, or to receive any other right; or

(ii) of any capital reorganization of the Corporation, any
reclassification of the Common Stock of the Corporation, or any Liquidation Event,

then, and in each such case, the Corporation will give or cause to be given to the holders of
Preferred Stock a notice specifying, as the case may be, (i) the record date for such dividend,
distribution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right, or (ii)
the effective date on which such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer,
dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is proposed to take place, and the time, if any is to be
fixed, as of which the holders of record of Common Stock (or such other stock or securities at
the time issuable upon the conversion of Preferred Stock) shall be entitled to exchange their
shares of Common Stock (or such other stock or securities) for securities or other property
deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer,
dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, and the amount per share and character of such exchange
applicable to Preferred Stock and the Common Stock. Such notice shall be given at least 15
business days prior to the record date or effective date for the event specified in such notice.

5. Mandatory Conversion.

(a) Upon the earlier of (A) the closing of the sale of shares of Common Stock to the
public at a price of at least $10.00 per share (subject to appropriate adjustment for stock splits,
stock dividends, combinations and other similar recapitalizations affecting such shares), in a
firm-commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, resulting in at least $30,000,000 of gross proceeds
to the Corporation (a “Qualified IPO”) or (B) a date specified by vote or written consent of the
Required Holders (the date of such closing or such vote or written consent is referred to herein as
the “Mandatory Conversion Date’), (y) all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall
automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the then effective applicable
Conversion Prices and (z) such shares may not be reissued by the Corporation as shares of such
series.

(b) All holders of record of shares of Preferred Stock shall be given written notice of

the Mandatory Conversion Date and the place designated for mandatory conversion of all such
shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 5. Such notice need not be given in advance of

19
the occurrence of the Mandatory Conversion Date. Upon receipt of such notice, each holder of
shares of Preferred Stock shall surrender his, her or its certificate or certificates for all such
shares to the Corporation at the place designated in such notice, and shall thereafter receive
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to this Section 5. On the Mandatory Conversion Date, all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock
shall be deemed to have been converted into shares of Common Stock, which shall be deemed to
be outstanding of record, and all rights with respect to Preferred Stock so converted, including
the rights, if any, to receive notices and vote (other than as a holder of Common Stock), will
terminate, except only the rights of the holders thereof, upon surrender of their certificate or
certificates therefor, to receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which
such Preferred Stock has been converted, and payment of any declared but unpaid dividends
thereon. If so required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be
endorsed or accompanied by written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to
the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or by his, her or its attorney duly
authorized in writing. As soon as practicable after the Mandatory Conversion Date and the
surrender of the certificate or certificates for Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall cause to be
issued and delivered to such holder, or on his, her or its written order, a certificate or certificates
for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable on such conversion in accordance with
the provisions hereof and cash as provided in Subsection 4(b) in respect of any fraction of a
share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion.

(c) Subject to Subsection 5(b) above, all certificates evidencing shares of Preferred
Stock which are required to be surrendered for conversion in accordance with the provisions
hereof shall, from and after the Mandatory Conversion Date, be deemed to have been retired and
cancelled and the shares of Preferred Stock represented thereby converted into Common Stock
for all purposes, notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender such
certificates on or prior to such date. Such converted Preferred Stock may not be reissued as
shares of such series, and the Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate action (without
the need for stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares
of Preferred Stock accordingly.

6. Redemption.

(a) Redemption. Ail of the Shares of Preferred Stock shall be redeemed by
the Corporation out of funds lawfully available therefor at a price per share equal to the
Liquidation Amount of such share (assuming for such purpose such amount to be payable
pursuant to Subsection 2(a) and Subsection 2(b) rather than the proviso in Subsection 2(c)) (the
“Redemption Price” of such share), in three annual installments commencing 60 days after
receipt by the Corporation at any time on or afier the fifth anniversary of the Series B Original
Issue Date from the Required Holders of written notice requesting redemption of all shares of
Preferred Stock (the date of each such installment being referred to as a “Redemption Date”).
On each Redemption Date, the Corporation shall redeem, on a pro rata basis in accordance with
the number of shares of Preferred Stock owned by each holder, that number of outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock determined by dividing (i) the total number of shares of Preferred
Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Redemption Date by (ii) the number of remaining
Redemption Dates (including the Redemption Date to which such calculation applies); provided,
however, that Excluded Shares (as such term is defined in Subsection 6.2) shall not be redeemed

20
and shall be excluded from the calculations set forth in this sentence. If the Corporation does not
have sufficient funds legally available to redeem on any Redemption Date all shares of Preferred
Stock to be redeemed on such Redemption Date, then the Corporation shall redeem a pro rata
portion of each holder’s redeemable shares of Preferred Stock out of funds legally available
therefor, based on the respective amounts which would otherwise be payable in respect of the
shares to be redeemed if the legally available funds were sufficient to redeem all such shares, and
shall redeem the remaining shares of Preferred Stock to have been redeemed as soon as
practicable after the Corporation has funds legally available therefor, until all shares of Preferred
Stock to have been redeemed as of such Redemption Date shall have been redeemed in full.

(b) Redemption Notice. Written notice of the mandatory redemption (the
‘Redemption Notice”) shall be given to each holder of record of Preferred Stock not less than
40 days prior to each Redemption Date. Each Redemption Notice shall state:

(1) the number of shares of Preferred Stock held by the
holder that the Corporation shall redeem on the
Redemption Date specified in the Redemption
Notice;

(II) the Redemption Date and each applicable
Redemption Price;

(ill) the date upon which the holder’s right to convert
such shares terminates (as determined in accordance
with Subsection 4(a)); and

(IV) _ that the holder is to surrender to the Corporation, in
the manner and at the place designated, his, her or
its certificate or certificates representing the shares
of Preferred Stock to be redeemed.

If the Corporation receives, on or prior to the 20th day after the date of delivery of the
Redemption Notice to a holder of Preferred Stock, written notice from such holder that such
holder elects to be excluded from the redemption provided in Section 6 then the shares of
Preferred Stock registered on the books of the Corporation in the name of such holder at the time
of the Corporation’s receipt of such notice shall thereafter be “Excluded Shares.” Excluded
Shares shall not be redeemed or redeemable pursuant to this Section 6, whether on such
Redemption Date or thereafter.

(c) Surrender_of Certificates; Payment. On or before the applicable Redemption
Date, each holder of shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such Redemption Date, unless
such holder has exercised his, her or its right to convert such shares as provided in Section 4
hereof, shall surrender the certificate or certificates representing such shares to the Corporation,
in the manner and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice, and thereupon the
Redemption Price for such shares shall be payable to the order of the person whose name appears
on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof. In the event fewer than all of the shares

21
of Preferred Stock represented by a certificate are redeemed, a new certificate representing the
unredeemed shares of Preferred Stock shall promptly be issued to such holder.

(d) Rights Subsequent to Redemption. If the Redemption Notice shall have been
duly given, and if on the applicable Redemption Date the Redemption Price payable upon
redemption of the shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such Redemption Date is paid or
tendered for payment or deposited with an independent payment agent so as to be available
therefor, then notwithstanding that the certificates evidencing any of the shares of Preferred
Stock so called for redemption shall not have been surrendered, dividends with respect to such
shares of Preferred Stock shall cease to accrue after such Redemption Date and all rights with
respect to such shares shall forthwith after the Redemption Date terminate, except only the right
of the holders to receive the Redemption Price without interest upon surrender of their
certificates therefor.

(e) Redeemed or Otherwise Acquired Shares. Any shares of Preferred Stock which
are redeemed or otherwise acquired by the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries shall be
automatically and immediately canceled and retired and shall not be reissued, sold or transferred.
Neither the Corporation nor any of its subsidiaries may exercise any voting or other rights
granted to the holders of Preferred Stock following redemption.

7. Waiver. Any of the rights, preferences and other terms of Preferred Stock set
forth herein may be waived by the affirmative consent or vote of the Required Holders.

8. Notices. Any notice to be given to the Corporation or a holder of its capital stock
hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed effectively given: (a) upon personal delivery
to the party to be notified, (b) when sent by electronic communication in compliance with the
provisions of the General Corporation Law or (c) when mailed, postage prepaid. Ail
communications to the Corporation shall be sent to the Corporation’s principal place of business,
and all communications to any holder of the Corporation’s capital stock shall be sent to such
holder’s most recent address as appears in the Corporation’s records.

FIFTH: In furtherance of and not in limitation of powers conferred by statute, it is
further provided that:

(a) Subject to the limitations and exceptions, if any, contained in the by-laws of
the Corporation, such by-laws may be adopted, amended or repealed by the board of
directors of the Corporation;

(b) Elections of directors need not be by written ballot unless, and only to the
extent, otherwise provided in the by-laws of the Corporation; and

(c) Subject to any applicable requirements of law, the books of the Corporation
may be kept outside the State of Delaware at such location or locations as may be
designated by the board of directors of the Corporation or in the by-laws of the
Corporation.

SIXTH: The Corporation shall indemnify each person who at any time is, or shall

22
have been, a director or officer of the Corporation and was or is a party or is threatened to be
made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director
or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director,
officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement incurred in connection with any such action, suit or proceeding, to the maximum
extent permitted by the General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be
amended. The foregoing right of indemnification shall in no way be exclusive of any other
rights of indemnification to which any such director or officer may be entitled, under any by-law,
agreement, vote of directors or stockholders or otherwise. No amendment to or repeal of the
provisions of this Article SIXTH shall deprive a director or officer of the benefit hereof with
respect to any act or failure to act occurring prior to such amendment or repeal. In furtherance of
and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Corporation shall advance expenses, including
attorneys’ fees, incurred by an officer or director of the Corporation in defending any civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding in advance of the final
disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of
such director or officer to repay such advances if it shall be ultimately determined that he is not
entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation
shall not be required to indemnify or advance expenses to any person in connection with any
action, suit, proceeding, claim or counterclaim initiated by or on behalf of such person.

SEVENTH: No director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the
Corporation or to any of its stockholders for monetary damages arising out of such director’s
breach of fiduciary duty as a director of the Corporation, except to the extent that the elimination
or limitation of such liability is not permitted by the General Corporation Law, as the same exists
or may hereafter be amended. No amendment to or repeal of the provisions of this Article
SEVENTH shall deprive any director of the Corporation of the benefit hereof with respect to any
act or failure to act of such director occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.

EIGHTH: Subject to the voting rights of stockholders set forth herein, the
Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this
Certificate of Incorporation in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by the General
Corporation Law and this Certificate of Incorporation, and all rights conferred upon stockholders
herein are granted subject to this reservation.

NINTH: The Corporation renounces any interest or expectancy of the Corporation
in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any Excluded Opportunity. An
“Excluded Opportunity” is any matter, transaction or interest that is presented to, or acquired,
created or developed by, or which otherwise comes into the possession of, (i) any director of the
Corporation who is not an employee of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, or (ii) any
holder of Preferred Stock or any partner, member, director, stockholder, employee or agent of
any such holder, other than someone who is an employee of the Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries (collectively, “Covered Persons”), unless such matter, transaction or interest is
presented to, or acquired, created or developed by, or otherwise comes into the possession of, a

Covered Person expressly and solely in such Covered Person’s capacity as a director of the
Corporation.
