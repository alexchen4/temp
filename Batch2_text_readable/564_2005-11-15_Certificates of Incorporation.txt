other exchanges, markets and systems, the market price as of the end of the regular hours trading
period that is generally accepted as such for such exchange, market or system. If, after the date
hereof, the benchmark times generally accepted in the securities industry for determining the market

6

price of a stock as of a given trading day shall change from those set forth above, the fair market
value shall be determined as of such other generally accepted benchmark times.

4. Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as follows
(the “Conversion Rights’):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option
of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share at the office of the
Corporation or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, into that number of fully-paid,
nonassessable shares of Common Stock determined by multiplying each share of Preferred Stock by
the Conversion Rate (as defined below) then in effect for such Preferred Stock. The “Conversion
Rate” for each such series shall be the quotient obtained by dividing the Original Issue Price for the
relevant series of Preferred Stock by the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock,
calculated to the nearest hundredth. Upon any decrease or increase in the Conversion Price for any
series of Preferred Stock, as described in this Section 4, the Conversion Rate for such series shall be
appropriately increased or decreased.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be
converted into fully-paid, non-assessable shares of Comnion Stock at the then effective Conversion
Rate for such share (i) immediately prior to the closing of a firm commitment underwritten public
offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the “Securities Act”), covering the offer and sale of the Corporation’s Common Stock, provided
that the offering price per share is not less than $2.43 (as adjusted for Recapitalizations) and the
aggregate proceeds (net of underwriting commissions and offering expenses) to the Corporation are
not less than $45,000,000, or (ii) upon the receipt by the Corporation of a written request for such
conversion from the holders of a majority of the Preferred Stock (on an as-converted basis) then
outstanding, or, if later, the effective date for conversion specified in such request (each of the events
referred to in (i) and (ii) are referred to herein as an “Automatic Conversion vent’).

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued
upon conversion of Preferred Stock. in lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would
otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the then
fair market value ot a share of Common Stock us determined by the Board of Directors. For such
purpose, all shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder of Preferred Stock shall be aggregated,
and, upon conversion, any resulting fractional share of Common Stock shall be paid in cash. Before
any holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to corvert the same into full shares of Common Stock,
and to receive certificates therefor, they shall either (A) surrender the certificate or certificates
therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for the Preferred
Stock or (B) notify the Corporation oc its transfer agent that such certificates have heen lost, stolen
or destroyed and execute an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation
from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates, and shall give written notice to the
Corporation at such office that they elect to convert the same; provided, however, that on the date of
an Automatic Conversion Event, the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted
automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the
certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent;

7

provided further, however, that the Corporation shall not be obiigated to issue certificates evidencing
the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such Automatic Conversion Event unless either the
certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are delivered to the Corporation or its transfer
agent as provided above, or the holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such
certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the
Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such
certificates. On the date of the occurrence of an Automatic Conversion Event, each holder of record
of shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion, notwithstanding that the certificates representing such shares of
Preferred Stock shall not have been surrendered at the office of the Corporation, that notice from the
Corporation shall not have been received by any holder of record of shares of Preferred Stock, or
that the certificates evidencing such shares of Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered to
such holder.

The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after such delivery, or after such agreement and
indemnification, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as
aforesaid and a check payable to the holder in the amount of any cash amounts payable as the result
of a conversion into fractional shares of Common Stock, plus any declared and unpaid dividends on
the converted Preferred Stock. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately
prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be
converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon
such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of
Common Stock on such date; provided, however, that if the conversion is in connection with an
underwritten offer of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act or a merger, sale or
liquidation of the Corporation, the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering Preferred
Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing of such transaction, in which event the
person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of the Preferred
Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the
closing of such transaction.

(d) Adjustments to Conversion Price for Diluting Issues.

: (i) Special Definition. For purposes of this Section 4(d), “Additional
Shares_of Common” shall mean all shares of Common Stock issued (or, pursuant to

(ii) No Adjustment of Conversion Price. No adjustment in the Conversion
Price of a particular series of Preferred Stock shall be made in respect of the issuance of Additional
Shares of Common unless the consideration per share (as determined pursuant to Section 4(d)(v)) for
an Additional Share of Common issued or deemed to be issued by the Corporation is less than the
Conversion Price in effect on the date of, and immediately prior to, such issue, for such series of
Preferred Stock.

Corporation at any time or from time to time after the date of the filing of this Amended and

Options or Convertible Securities, ihen the maximum number of shares (as set forth in the
insuument relating thereto without regard to any provisions contained therein for a subsequent
adjustment of such number) of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Options or, in the
case of Convertible Securities, the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities or, in the
case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options and the conversion or
exchange of the underlying securities, shall be deemed to have been issued as of the time of such
issue or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record
date, provided that in any such case in which shares are deemed to be issued:

(1) no further adjustment in the Conversion Price of any series of
Preferred Stock shail be made upon the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities or shares of
Common Stock in connection with the exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securitics;

(2) if such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms provide,
with the passage of time or otherwise, for any change in the consideration payable to the Corporation
or in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange
thereof (other than a change pursuant to the anti-dilution provisions of such Options or Convertible
Securities such as this Section 4(d) or pursuant to Recapitalization provisions of such Options or
Convertible Securities such as Sections 4(e), 4(f), 4(g) and 4(h) hereof), the Conversion Price of
each series of Preferred Stock and any subsequent adjustments based thereon shall be recomputed to
reflect such change as if such change had been in effect as of the original issue thereof (or upon the
occurrence of the record date with respect thereto);

(3) no readjustment pursuant to clause (2) above shall have the effect
of increasing the Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock to an amount above the Conversion
Price that wouki have resulted from any other issuances of Additional Shares of Common and any
other adjustments provided for herein between the original adjustment date and such readjustment
date;

(4) upon the expiration of any such Options or any rights of
conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have been exercised, the
Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon
the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto) and any subsequent adjustments based thereon
shall, upon such expiration, be recomputed as if:

(A) _ in the case of Convertible Securities or Options for
Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common issued were the shares of Common Stock, if
any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities and the consideration received therefor was the consideration actually
received by the Corporation for the issue of such exercised Options plus the consideration actually
received by the Corporation upon such exercise or for the issue of all such Convertible Securities
which were actually converted or exchanged, plus the additional consideration, if any, actually
received by the Corporation upon such conversion or exchange, and

(B) in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, only
the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were issued at the time of
issue of such Options, and the consideration received by the Corporation for the Additional Shares of
Common deemed to have been then issued was the consideration actually received by the
Corporation for the issue of such exercised Options, plus the consideration deemed to have been
received by the Corporation (determined pursuant to Section 4(d)(v)) upon the issue of the
Convertible Securities with respect to which such Options were actually exercised; and

(5) if such record date shall have been fixed and such Options or
Convertible Securities are not issued on the date fixed therefor, the adjustment previously made in
the Conversion Price which became effective on such record date shall be canceled as of the close of

10
business on such record date, and thereafter the Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this
Section 4(d)(iii) as of the actual date of their issuance.

(iv) Adjustment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional Shares
of Common. {n the event the Corporation shall issue Additional Shares of Common (including

Additional Shares of Common deemed to be issued pursuant to Section 4(d)(iii)) without

consideration or for a consideration per share less than the applicable Conversion Price of a series of
Preferred Stock in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such issue, then: (a) with respect to

the Series A Preferred Stock, the Conversion Price of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be reduced,

concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying

such Conversion Price by a fraction, (x) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of

Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of shares which the

aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of

Common so issued would purchase at such Conversion Price, and (y) the denominator of which shall

be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the

number of such Additional Shares of Common so issued; and (b) with respect to the Series By
Preferred Stock, the Conversion Price of the Series B Preferred Stock shall be reduced, concurrently

with such issue, to a price equal to the consideration per share received by the Corporation for such

Additional Shares of Common so issued.» Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Conversion Price shal]

not be reduced at such time if the amount of such reduction would be less than $0.01. For the

purposes of this Subsection 4(d)(iv), all shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all

outstanding shares of Preferred Stock and the exercise and/or conversion of any other outstanding

Convertible Securities and all outstanding Options shall be deemed to be outstanding.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this subsection 4(d),
the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue (or deemed issue) of any Additional
Shares of Common shall be computed as follows:

(1) Cash and Property. Such consideration shall:

(a) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
aggregate amount of cash received by the Corporation;

(b) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
ccmputed at the fair market value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors; and

(c) in the event Additional Shares of Common are issued
together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for consideration which
covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in clauses
(a) and (b) above, as reasonably determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(2) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per share

received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common deemed to have been issued pursuant
to Section 4(d)(iii) shall be determined by dividing:

11
(x) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the
Corporation as consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the
minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating
thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such
consideration) payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the
exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities, by

(y) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, other than a change pursuant to the anti-
dilution provisions of such Options or Convertible Securities such as this Section 4(d) or pursuant to
Recapitalization provisions of such Options or Convertible Securities such as Sections 4(e), 4(f),
4(g) and 4(h) hereof).

(e) Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of Common Stock. In the event
the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided (by stock split, by payment of a stock

dividend or otherwise), into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price of
each series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall, concurrently
with the effectiveness of such subdivision, be proportionately decreased. In the event the
outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined (by reclassification or otherwise) into a
lesser number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Prices of each series of Preferred Stock
in effect immediately prior to such combination shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such
combination, be proportionately increased.

(f) Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of Preferred Stock. In the event
the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock or a series of Preferred Stock shall be subdivided (by stock

split, by payment of a stock dividend or otherwise), into a greater number of shares of Preferred
Stock, the Original Issue Price and Liquidation Preference of the affected series of Preferred Stock in
effect immeaiately prior to such subdivision shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such
subdivision, be proportionately decreased. In the event the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock or
a series of Preferred Stock shall be combined (by reclassification or otherwise) into a lesser number
of shares of Preferred Stock, the Original Issue Price and Liquidation Preference of the affected
series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such combination shall, concurrently with the
effectiveness of such combination, be proportionately increased.

(g) Adjustment for Common Stock Dividends and Distributions. If the Corporation,
at any time or from time to time after the date of filing of this Amended and Restaed Articles of
incorporation, makes, or fixes a record datz for the determination of holders of Common Stock
entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in shares of Common Stock, in each such
event the Conversion Price then in effect for each series of Preferred Stock shall be decreased as of
the time of such issuance or, in the event such record date is fixed, as of the close of business on
such record date, by multiplying the Conversion Price then in effect for such series of Preferred
Stock by a fraction (i) the numerator of which is the total number of shares of Common Stock issued

12
and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issues or the close of business on such record
date and (ii) the denominator of which is the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of business on such record
date plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or
distribution; provided, however, that if such record date is fixed and such dividend is not fully paid
or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the Conversion Price for each
series of Preferred Stock shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record
date and thereafter the Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this Section 4(g) to reflect the
actual payment of such dividend or distribution.

(h) Adjustments for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. Subject to
Section 3 above, if at any time or from time to time, the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of

the Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of any other class
or classes of stock, whether by recapitalization, capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise
(other than a subdivision, combination of shares or merger or sale of assets provided for above or in
Section 3), then, in any such event, in lieu of the number of shares of Common Stock which the
holders would otherwise have been entitled to receive, each holder of such Preferred Stock shall
have the night thereafter to convert such shares of Preferred Stock into a number of shares of such
other class or classes of stock which a holder of the number of shares of Cominon Stock deliverable
upon conversion of such series of Preferred Stock immediately before that change would have been
entitled to receive in such reorganization or reclassification, all subject to further adjustment as
provided herein with respect to such other shares. In addition, to the extent applicable in any
reorganization or recapitalization, provision shall be made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock
shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of the Preferred Stock the number of shares of
stock or other securities or property of the Corporation or otherwise, to which a holder of Common
Stock deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled on such reorganization or
recapitalization.

(i) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation at its expense shall
promptly compute such adjusiment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and fumish
to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and
showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation
shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be
furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and readjustments, (ii) the
Conversion Price at the time in effect and (isi) the number of shares of Common Stock and the
amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon the conversion of
Preferred Stock.

GY Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at all
times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock solely

for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock, such number of its
shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then
outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding

Preferred Stock which have not been converted into Common Stock, in three (3) equal annual ”
installments (each a “Redemption Date”). The Corporation shall redeem the shares of Series B’
Preferred Stock by paying in cash an amount per share equal to the Original Issue Price for such
Series B Preferred Stock, plus an arnount equal to all declared or accrued but unpaid dividends
thereon, whether or not earned (the “Redemption Price”). The number of shares of Series B
Preferred Stock that the Corporation shall be required under this Section 6 to redeem on any one (1)
Redemption Date shall be equal to the amount determined by dividing: (a) the aggregate number of
shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Redemption Date by; (b) the
number of remaining Redemption Dates (including the Redemption Date to which such calculation
applies). If the funds legally available for redemption of the Series B Preferred Stock shall be
insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full respective Redemption Prices, the
Corporation shall effect such redemption pro rata among the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock
so that each holder of Series B Preferred Stock shall receive a redemption payment equal to a
fraction of the aggregate amount available for redemption, the numerator of which is the number of
shares of Series B Preferred Stock held by such holder with each number multiplied by the
Redemption Price of each share of Series B Preferred Stock keld by such holder, and the
denominator of which is the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding multiplied by
the Redemption Price of each such outstanding share of Series B Preferred Stock, and the
Corporation shall redeem the remaining shares to be redeemed as soon as sufficient funds are legally
available.

(b) Any redemption effected pursuant to Section 6(a) shall be made on a pro rata
basis among the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock in proportion to the shares of Series B
Preferred Stock then held by them.

notifying such holder of the redemption to be effected, specifying the number of shares to be
tedeemed from such holder, the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price, the place at which
payment may be obtained and calling upon such holder to surrender to the Corporation, in the
manner and at the place designated, the holder’s certificate or certificates representing the shares to
be redeemed (the “Redemption Notice”). Except as provided herein, on or after the Redemption
Date each holder of Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall surrender to this Corporation the certificate
or certificates representing such shares, in the manner and at the place designated in the Redemption
Notice, and thereupi n the Redemption Price of such shares shall be payable to the order of the
person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof and each
surrendered certificate shall be cancelled. In the event less than all the shares represented by any
such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares.

default in payment of the Redemption Price, all rights of the holders of shares of Preferred Stock
designated for redemption in the Redemption Notice as holders of Preferred Stock (except the right
to receive the Redemption Price without interest upon surrender of their certificate or certificates)
shall cease with respect to the shares designated for redemption on such date, and such shares shall
not thereafter be transferred on the books of the Corporation or be deemed to be outstanding for any
purpose whatsoever. The shares of Preferred Stock not redeemed shall remain outstanding and
