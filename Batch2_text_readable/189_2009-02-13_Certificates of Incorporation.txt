outstanding Series D Preferred (in the case of the automatic conversion of the Series D
Preferred) voting as a separate class on an as-converted basis. (y) fifty-one percent (51%) of the
outstanding Series E Preferred (in the case of the automatic conversion of the Series E Preferred)
voting as a separate class on an as-converted basis, or (z) a majority of the outstanding Series F
Preferred (in the case of the automatic conversion of the Series F Preferred) voting as a separate
class on an as-converted basis, or (ii) upon the voluntary conversion by the holders of (w) not
less than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred and Series
C Preferred (in the case of the automatic conversion of the Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred
and Series C Preferred), (x) at least fifty-five percent (55%) of the outstanding Series D Preferred
(in the case of the automatic conversion of the Series D Preferred), (y) at least fifty-one percent
(51%) of the outstanding Series E Preferred (in the case of the automatic conversion of the Series
E Preferred), or (z) at least sixty five percent (65%) of the outstanding Series F Preferred (in the
case of the automatic conversion of the Series F Preferred).

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall
be issued upon conversion of the Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the
holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction
multiplied by the then effective Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock. Conversion
of shares of Preferred Stock at the option of the holder thereof shall be effected by delivery, to
the office of the Corporation or to any transfer agent for such shares, of duly endorsed
certificates for the shares being converted and of written notice to the Corporation that the holder
elects to convert such shares. Conversion shall be deemed to occur immediately prior to the
close of business on the date the shares and notice are delivered. Automatic conversion of the
Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 4(b) shall be effective without any further action on the part
of the holders of such shares and shall be effective whether or not the certificates for such shares
are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent. Holders entitled to receive Common
Stock upon conversion of Preferred Stock shall be treated for all purposes as the record holders
of such shares of Common Stock on the date conversion is deemed to occur. The Corporation
shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of Preferred Stock unless either (i) the certificates evidencing such shares being
converted are delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent as provided above, or (ii) the
holder (A) notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost,
stolen or destroyed and (B) executes an agreement, and at the Corporation's election provides a
surety bond or other security, satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from
any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates. The Corporation shall, as soon as
practicable after the delivery of such certificates, or the agreement to indemnify in the case of a
lost certificate, issue and deliver to the holder of the shares of Preferred Stock being converted, a
certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which the holder is
entitled and a check payable to the holder for any cash due with respect to fractional shares.

(d) Adjustments of Conversion Price for Certain Diluting Issuances,
Splits and Combinations. The applicable Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock
shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows (provided, however, that the

-10-

34859-0014/LEGAL15160538.10
Conversion Price applicable to the Series A Preferred shal! not be subject to adjustment pursuant
to subsection (i) of this Section 4(d)):

(i) Adjustment of Conversion Price upon Issuance of Additional
Shares of Common Stock below the Conversion Price. If the

Corporation issues at any time after the date of this Sixth Restated
Certificate, Additional Shares of Common Stock (including
Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant
to Section 4(d)(i)(D)) without consideration or for a consideration
per share less than the Conversion Price for the Series F Preferred
in effect immediately prior to such issue, then and in such event,
such Conversion Price for Series B Preferred, Series C Preferred,
Series D Preferred, Series E Preferred and Series F Preferred, as
applicable, shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a
price (calculated to the nearest hundredth of a cent) as set forth
herein, unless otherwise provided in this Section 4.

(A) Adjustment Formula.

(1) With respect to any adjustment of the Series F
Conversion Price, the new Series F Conversion Price shall be determined by reducing the
Series F Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment, concurrently with such
issue, to a price equal to the Effective Price of such Additional Shares of Common Stock. The
"Effective Price" of Additional Shares of Common Stock shal] mean the quotient determined by
dividing (i) the aggregate consideration received, or under Section 4(d)(i)E) deemed to have
been received, by the Corporation for such Additional Shares of Common Stock, by (ii) the total
number of Additional Shares of Common Stock issued or sold, or under Section 4(d)(i)(D)
deemed to have been issued or sold.

(2) With respect to any adjustment of the Conversion
Price for Series B Preferred, Series C Preferred, Series D or Series E Preferred under this
Section 4(d)(i), the new Series B Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price, Series D
Conversion Price and/or Series E Conversion Price. as the case may be, shall be adjusted to a
price determined by multiplying the Series B Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price,
Series D Conversion Price and/or Series E Conversion Price, as the case may be. in effect
immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction (the "Weighted Average”), the numerator of
which shall be the number of shares of "Common Stock Outstanding” immediately prior to such
issuance (including shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to Section 4(d)(i)(D)
plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received by the
Corporation for such issuance would purchase at such Series B Conversion Price, Series C
Conversion Price, Series D Conversion Price and/or Series E Conversion Price. as applicable. in
effect immediately prior to such issue; and the denominator of which shall be the number of
shares of "Common Stock Outstanding" immediately prior to such issuance (including shares of
Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to Section 4(d)(i)(D)) plus the number of shares of
such Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued. For the purpose of this paragraph, the
number of shares of "Common Stock Outstanding" shall be deemed to include all Common
Stock issued and outstanding. any Common Stock issuable upon conversion of issued and

-l]-

34859-0U14/LEGAL15 1] 60538.10
outstanding Preferred Stock, and any Common Stock issuable upon exercise or conversion of all
other outstanding Convertible Securities and Options whether vested or unvested and whether or
not immediately exercisable (assuming conversion of Convertible Securities issuable upon
exercise of Options therefor).

(B) Special Definitions. For purposes of this Section 4, the

(X) Common Stock issuable or issued by way of
dividend or other distributions on securities referred to in subsections (I) through (IX) above.

(C) No Adjustment of Conversion Price; Pro-Rata Offering

(1) No adjustment in the Conversion Price for Series B
Preferred. Series C Preferred, Series D Preferred, Series E Preferred or Series F Preferred shall
be made in respect of the issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock unless the
consideration per share for an Additional Share of Common Stock issued or deemed to be issued
by the Corporation is less than the Conversion Price in effect for Series F Preferred immediately
prior to such issue.

(2) In addition to the foregoing, if the Corporation
offers at least 27,216,174 shares of Series F Preferred (as adjusted for any stock dividends,
combinations, recapitalizations or splits with respect to such shares following the date of this
Sixth Restated Certificate) for subscription by holders of the Company's Preferred Stock, the

proportion that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock then held by such holder bears to the total number of
shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock.

(3) In the event that such holder and/or its affiliates
fails to purchase its Pro-Rata Portion of such shares of Series F Preferred by the Mandatory
Offering Date (as defined below) such holder shall be deemed to be a "Nonparticipating

-13-

34859-001 4/LEGAL15160538.10
Holder.” For each Nonparticipating Holder, fifty percent (50%) of the shares of each of the
Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred, Series C Preferred. Series D Preferred and Series E
Preferred, respectively, then held by such holder shall, on the date designated by the Corporation,
which date shall be at least 10 days following the date of the Issuance Notice ( the "Mandatory
Offering Date"), be automatically converted into Common Stock at the then applicable
Conversion Rate(s) for such shares of Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred, Series C Preferred,
Series D Preferred or Series E Preferred, respectively, and no adjustment to such Conversion
Price(s) or Conversion Rate(s) of any series shall be made with respect to the issuance of shares
of Series F Preferred.

(4) The holder of any shares of Series A Preferred,
Series B Preferred, Series C Preferred, Series D Preferred and Series E Preferred converted
pursuant to Section (B)(4)(d)(i)(C)(3) shall deliver to this Corporation during regular business
hours at the office of any transfer agent of this Corporation for the Series A Preferred, Series B
Preferred, Series C Preferred, Series D Preferred and Series E Preferred, or at such other place as

respect to those shares that have converted to Common Stock on the Mandatory Offering Date,
and (2) a replacement certificate or certificates for the remaining shares of Series A Preferred,
Series B Preferred, Series C Preferred, Series D Preferred and Series E Preferred that have not so
converted on the Mandatory Offering Date, unless the transfer books of this Corporation are
closed on that date, in which event such holder shall be deemed to have become a stockholder of
record of Common Stock on the next succeeding date on which the transfer books are open.
From and after the Mandatory Offering Date, the certificate or certificates representing shares of
Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred, Series C Preferred, Series D Preferred and Series E
Preferred converted pursuant to Section (B)(4)(d)(i)(C)(3) shall represent the shares of Common
Stock into which such shares of Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred, Series C Preferred, Series
D Preferred and Series E Preferred were converted.

(D) Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock.
If the Corporation at any time after the Original Issue Date of the Series F Preferred shall issue
any Options or Convertible Securities or shall fix a record date for the determination of any
holders of any class of securities entitled to receive any such Options or Convertible Securities,
then the maximum number of shares (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto without
regard to any provisions contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) of
Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case of Convertible
Securities and Options for Convertible Securities, the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to be Additional Shares of Common Stock issued as of
the time of such issuance or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of
business on such record date, provided that in any such case in which Additional Shares of
Common Stock are deemed to be issued:

(1) no further adjustment to the Conversion Price for
any series of Preferred Stock shall be made upon the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities,

-14-

34859-0014/LEGAL 15160538. 10
or Common Stock issued upon the exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities:

(2) if such Options or Convertible Securities by their
terms provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any increase or decrease in the
consideration payable to the Corporation, or increase or decrease in the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable, upon the exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, then the Conversion
Price for each affected series of Preferred Stock computed upon the original issuance thereof (or
upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based
thereon, shall, upon any such increase or decrease becoming effective, be recomputed to reflect
such increase or decrease insofar as it affects such Options or the rights of conversion or
exchange under such Convertible Securities;

(3) upon the expiration of any such Options or any
rights of conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities that have not been exercised,
the Conversion Price for each affected series of Preferred Stock computed upon the original issue
thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent
adjustments based thereon. shall, upon such expiration, be recomputed as if:

(1) in the case of Convertible Securities or
Options for Common Stock, the only additional shares of Common Stock issued were shares of
Common Stock, if any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, and the consideration received therefor was the
consideration actually received by the Corporation for the issuance of all such Options, whether
or not exercised, plus the consideration actually received by the Corporation upon such exercise,
or for the issuance of all such Convertible Securities that were actually converted or exchanged,
plus the additional consideration, if any, actually received by the Corporation upon such
conversion or exchange, and

(IJ) in the case of Options for Convertible
Securities, only the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were
issued at the time of issue of such Options and the consideration received by the Corporation for
the Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been then issued was the consideration
actually received by the Corporation for the issuance of all such Options, whether or not
exercised, plus the consideration deemed to have been received by the Corporation upon the
issuance of the Convertible Securities with respect to which such Options were actually
exercised:

(4) no readjustment pursuant to subsections (2) or (3)
above shall have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock to
an amount which exceeds the lesser of (x) the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred
Stock, on the original adjustment date. or (y) the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred
Stock that would have resulted from any issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock
between the original adjustment date and such readjustment date, and no readjustment shall
affect Common Stock issued on conversion of Preferred Stock prior to such readjustment; and

-15-

34859-0014/LEGAL15160538.10
(5) in the case of any Options that expire by their terms
not more than ninety (90) days after the date of issue thereof, no adjustment of the Conversion
Price for any series of Preferred Stock shall be made until the expiration or exercise of all such
Options.

(E) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this
Section 4(d), the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional
Shares of Common Stock shall be computed as follows:

(1) Cash and Property. Such consideration shall:

(1) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at
the aggregate amount of cash received by the Corporation prior to amounts paid or payable for
accrued interest or declared dividends and prior to any commissions or expenses paid by the
Corporation;

(i insofar as it consists of property other than
cash, be computed at the fair value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith
by the board of directors; and

(fl) if Additional Shares of Common Stock are
issued together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for consideration
which covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received for the Additional Shares
of Common Stock, computed as provided in subsections (1) and (II) above, as determined in
good faith by the board of directors.

(2) Options and Convertible Securities. The
consideration per share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock

deemed to have been issued pursuant to Section 4(d)(i)(D), in respect of Options and Convertible
Securities, shall be determined by dividing:

(1) the total amount, if any, received or
receivable by the Corporation as consideration for the issuance of such Options or Convertible
Securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the
instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent
adjustment of such consideration) payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such Option or
the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for
Convertible Securities. the exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities and the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities by

(II) the maximum number of shares of Common
Stock (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained
therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options
or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities.

(ii) Adjustments for Stock Dividends, Combinations or Splits. If,
after the date of this Fifth Restated Certificate, the outstanding

shares of Common Stock are subdivided, by stock split or

-16-

34859-0014/LEGAL15160538.10
otherwise, into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, or if
the Corporation shall declare or pay any dividend on the Common
Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, then the Conversion
Prices in effect prior to such event shall be proportionately
decreased upon the occurrence of such event. If, after the date of
this Sixth Restated Certificate, the outstanding shares of Common
Stock are combined or consolidated, by reclassification, reverse
stock split or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of Common
Stock, then the Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock
in effect prior to such event shall be proportionately increased
upon the occurrence of such event.

(e) Adjustments for Other Distributions. If, after the date of this Sixth
Restated Certificate, the Corporation fixes a record date for the determination of holders of
Common Stock entitled to receive any distribution payable in securities of the Corporation other
than shares of Common Stock (excluding any distribution in which the Preferred Stock
participates on an as-converted basis, and any distribution for which adjustment is otherwise
made pursuant to this Section 4), then in each such case provision shall be made so that the
holders of Preferred Stock receive upon conversion, in addition to the Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of their shares, the property or other securities of the Corporation that they
would otherwise have received had their shares of Preferred Stock been converted into Common
Stock immediately prior to such event and had they thereafter retained such securities, subject to
all other adjustments called for during such period under this Section 4 of this Division (B).

(f) Adjustments for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. If, after
the date of this Sixth Restated Certificate, the Common Stock is changed into the same or a

different number of shares of any other class or series of stock, whether by capital
reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a Deemed Liquidation under Section 2 of
this Division B, and events for which adjustment is made pursuant to Sections 4(d)(ii) or 4{e)
above of this Division (B)). the Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock then in effect
shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such reorganization, reclassification or change, be
adjusted such that the Preferred Stock shall be convertible into, in lieu of the Common Stock
which the holders thereof would otherwise have been entitled to receive, a number of shares of
such other class or series of capital stock equivalent to the number of shares of such other class
or series of capital stock that such holders would have been entitled to receive in such
reclassification, capital reorganization or change for the number of shares of Common Stock that
the holders would have been entitled to receive upon conversion of their Preferred Stock
immediately prior to such reclassification, capital reorganization or change.

(g) No Impairment. The Corporation will not without first obtaining the
consent of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, avoid or
seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed
under this Section 4 by the Corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying
out of all the provisions of this Section 4 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary
or appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock
under this Section 4 against impairment.

-17-

34859-0014/LEGAI.15160538.10
(h) Certificate as to Adjustments. The Corporation shall promptly compute
any Conversion Price adjustments and provide each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate
describing such adjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment is based.
If requested in writing by any holder of Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall provide such
holder a certificate describing any Conversion Price adjustments. the current Conversion Price
and the amount of Common Stock or other property issuable upon conversion of the shares of
Preferred Stock held by such holder.

(i) Notices of Record Date. If the Corporation shall propose at any time:

(A) to declare any dividend or distribution upon its Common
Stock other than a distribution payable solely in Common Stock;

(B) to effect any reclassification or recapitalization of its
Common Stock; or

(C) to merge or consolidate with or into any other corporation,
or sell, lease or convey all or substantially all its property or business, or to liquidate, dissolve or
wind up;

Then, in connection with each such event. the Corporation shall send to
the holders of the Preferred Stock:

(1) at least twenty (20) days’ prior written notice of the
date on which a record shall be taken for such dividend or distribution (and specifying the date
on which the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled thereto) or for determining rights to vote
in respect of the matters referred to in (C) above: and

(2) in the case of the matters referred to in (C) above, at
least twenty (20) days’ prior written notice of the date when the same shall take place (and
specifying the date on which the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to exchange their
Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon the occurrence of such event).

Each such written notice shall be delivered personally or given by first
class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the holders of Preferred Stock at the addresses for such
stockholders as shown on the books of the Corporation.

(j) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall
at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common

Stock, solely for the puréose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock,
such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock: and if at any time the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, in addition to such other remedies as shall
be available to the holder of such Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate
action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes,

-18-

34859-0014/LEGAL15160538.10
including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval
of any necessary amendment to this Sixth Restated Certificate.

5. Voting
