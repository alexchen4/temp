holders of Series Preferred Stock, an amount per share of Series B-] Preferred Stock equal to
(1) the Series B-1 Liquidation Value plus (2) all declared and unpaid dividends on such share of
Series B-1 Preferred Stock, if any. If the amount of cash, securities or other property which a
holder of any shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock would have been entitled to receive with

distribution to the holders of Series Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit payment to .

such holders of the full preferential amounts described in this Section 2.3.A.3(a) and Section
2.3.3(a) of the Articles, then the entire amount of assets and funds available for distribution shall
be distributed ratably among the holders of Series Preferred Stock in proportion to the
preferential amount each such holder is otherwise entitled to receive under this Section
2.3.A.3(a) and Section 2.3.3(a) of the Articles. The “Series B-1 Liquidation Value” of any share
of Series B-1 Preferred Stock as of any particular date shall be equal to $1.10, as adjusted for any
stock dividends, stock splits, combinations, reorganizations, recapitalizations, reclassifications or
similar transactions affecting the number of outstanding shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock.

(>) Remaining Assets. After the payment of the full liquidation preference of
the Series B-1 Preferred Stock as set forth in Section 2.3.A.3(a) above and Section 2,3,3(a) of the

distributed ratably among the holders of Common Stock. )

oo (1) Deemed Liguidations. For purposes of this Section 2.3.A.3, a
Liquidation Transaction of the Company (unless otherwise determined by the holders of a
majority of the outstanding Series B-1 Preferred Stock) shall be deemed to include a Deemed
Liquidation and each holder of Series B-t Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive in
connection therewith payment from the Company (or the successor or purchasing entity) in the
aggregate amount specified herein that such holder would have received upon a Liquidation
Transaction in accordance with this Section 2,3.A,3. :

holders of shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section'2.3.A.3 shall be paid in
the same form of consideration that is paid to the other shareholders of the Company, with the
value of any such non-cash consideration (other than securities) determined as provided in the
definitive agreement(s) entered into in connection with any such Liquidation Transaction, or, if

the non-cash consideration consists of securities for which no value is established in such
definitive agreement(s),.as follows:

(A) Freely Tradable Securities. The method of valuation of
securities not subject to investment letter or other similar restrictions on free marketability shall
be as follows:

(i} if traded on a securities exchange or the Nasdaq
National Market, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the
securities on such exchange over the thirty-day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing;

(ii) if actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall
be deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the
thirty-day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing; and

(iii) if there is no active public market, the value shall be
the fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(B) Restricted Securities, The method of valuation of securities
subject to investment letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions
arising solely by virtue of a shareholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to
make an appropriate discount from the market value determined to reflect the approximate fair
market value thereof, as determined by the Board of Directors.

2.3.4.4 Conversion Rights. The Series B-1 Preferred Stock shall be convertible as
follows:

| (a) General. Subject to and in compliance with the provisions of this
Section 2.3.4.4, any shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock may, at the option of the holder, be
converted at any time into fully-paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock.

{1} All outstanding shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock shall
automatically be converted into fully-paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock upon the
earlier of (A) the effectiveness of a registration statement in connection with an underwritten
public offering under the Securities Act, covering the sale of Common Stock to the public that

underwriting discounts and commissions) or (B) the date specified by written consent or
agreement of the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Series B-1 Preferred
Stock, voting together as a single class,

(2) The number of shares of Common Stock to which a holder of
Series B-1 Preferred Stock shall be entitled upon conversion under this Section 2.3.A.4(a) shall
be the product obtained by multiplying the Applicable Conversion Rate (determined as provided
in Section 2.3.4,4(b) below) by the number of shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock to be
converted,

(b) Applicable Conversion Rate. The Applicable Conversion Rate for each
share of Series B-] Preferred Stock shall be the quotient obtained by dividing the Original

Purchase Price for the Series B-1 Preferred Stock, as set forth below, by the Conversion Price
applicable to the Series B-1 Preferred Stock, determined as hereinafter provided, in effect on the
date the certificate is surrendered for conversion. The Original Purchase Price for the Series B-1
Preferred Stock is $1.10 per share. As of the date of filing of these Amended Articles, the initial
Conversion Price for the Series B-] Preferred Stock is $1.10 per share. The initial Series B-1
Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 2.3.A.4(d).

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Series B-] Preferred
Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall
surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Company or of
any transfer agent for such Series B-1 Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the
Company at its principal corporate office, of the election to convert the same and shall state
therein the name or names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock are
to be issued. The Company shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such
office to such holder of Series B-1 Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder
(subject to any applicable transfer restrictions), a certificate or certificates for the number of
shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid. Such conversion
shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such
sutrender of the shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock to be converted, the rights of the holder of
the shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock converted as a holder of Series B-1 Preferred Stock shall
cease, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon
such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of
Common Stock as of such date. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if a conversion of
Series B-1 Preferred Stock is to be made in connection with a Liquidation Transaction, an
underwritten offering of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act or another transaction
affecting the Company or a holder of Series B-1 Preferred Stock, the conversion of any shares of
Series B-1 Preferred Stock may, at the election of the holders such shares, be conditioned upon
the consummation of such event or transaction, in which case such conversion shall not be
deemed to be effective until such event or transaction has been consummated.

(4) Conversion Price Adjustments of Series B-1 Preferred Stock for Certain
Dilutive Issuances, Splits and Combinations. The applicable Conversion Price of the Series B-1
Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time after the date hereof, as follows:

(1) Issuance of Additional Stock below Purchase Price.

(A)  Issuances of Additional Stock. If the Company shall issue,
any Additional Stock (as defined below) for consideration per share less than the Conversion
Price applicable to the Series B-1 Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to the issuance of
such Additional Stock, such Conversion Price shall automatically be adjusted aa set forth i in this
Section 2.3.A.4(d)(1), unless otherwise provided in this Section 2.3.4.4(d)(1).

Adjustment Formula, Whenever the Conversion Price is
adjusted pursuant to Section 2. 3.A. A(d)(1)(A), the new Conversion Price shall be determined by
multiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional
Stock by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Outstanding
Common Stock (as defined below) immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares

of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received by the Company for the total
number of shares of Additional Stock so issued would purchase at the Conversion Price
applicable to the Series B-1 Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such issuance and
(ii) the denominator of which shall be the numiber of shares of Outstanding Common Stock
immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock 50 issued.
For purposes of the foregoing calculation, the term “Outstanding Common Stock” shall mean the
number of shares of Common Stock actually issued and outstanding at the time of determination
plus the number of shares of Common Stock deemed issued at such time Pursuant to
Section 2.3.A.4(d)(1)(F) below,

(C) Definition of “Additional Stock". For purposes of this
Section 2.3.A.4(d\{1), “Additional Stock” shall mean any shares of Common Stock issued (or
