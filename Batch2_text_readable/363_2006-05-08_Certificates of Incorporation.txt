({e) Certain Acquisitions.

(i) Deemed Liquidation. For purposes of this Section 2, a
liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation shall be deemed to occur (A) if the Corporation
shall, in a transaction or series of transactions, sell, convey, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all
of its property or business (including a perpetual, irrevocable, exclusive (even as to the Corporation),
worldwide license of substantially all of the Corporation’s intellectual property), merge with or into or
consolidate with any other corporation (other than a whoily-owned subsidiary corporation), or (B) if there
occurs any sale, transfer or issuance or series of sales, transfers and/or issuances of shares of the

the Corporation’s outstanding capital stock possessing the voting power to elect a majority of the
Corporation’s Board of Directors immediately prior to such sale or issuance cease to own the

Corporation’s Board of Directors; provided however, that this Section 2(d)(i) shall not apply (1) toa
merger effected exclusively for the purpose of changing the domicile of the Corporation, (2) to an equity

defined below) and related transactions.

(ii) Valuation of Consideration. In the event of a deemed
liquidation as described in Section 2(d)(G) above, if the consideration received by the Corporation is other

(A) Securities not subject to investment letter or other
similar restrictions on free marketability:

qd) If traded on a securities exchange or The Nasdaq

and derived from the closing prices of the securities on such exchange or Nasdaq over a specified time
period;

(2) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value
shall be based on a formula approved, in good faith, by the Board of Directors and derived from the
closing prices of the securities on such exchange or Nasdaq over a specified time period; and

(3) If there is no active public market, the value
shall be the fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(B) ‘The method of valuation of securities subject to
investment letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue
of a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount from
the market value determined as above in Section 2(d)(ii)(A) to reflect the approximate fair market value
thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(C) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the consideration
received by the Corporation or the proceeds to be distributed to holders of shares of the Corporation’s
capital stock is other than cash and the merger agreement, asset purchase agreement or other definitive
transaction document entered into with respect to such deemed liquidation, dissolution or winding up

Stock.

Section 2(d) are not complied with, the Corporation shall! forthwith either cause the closing of the
transaction to be postponed until such requirements have been complied with, or cancel such transaction,
in which event the rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of the Preferred Stock shall revert to
and be the same as such rights, preferences and privileges existing immediately prior to the date of the
first notice referred to in Section 2(d)(iii) hereof.

3, Redemption. The Preferred Stock is not redeemable.

4, Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as
follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Subject to Section 4(c), each share of Preferred Stock
shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such
share, at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for such stock, into such number of fully paid
and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing (i) $0.50 in the case of the

Preferred, (iv) $0.0778 in the case of the Scrics 1 Preferred, and (v) $0.2032 in the case of the Series 2
Preferred by the Conversion Price applicable to such share, determined as hereafter provided, in effect on
the date the certificate is surrendered for conversion, The initial “Conversion Price” per share shall be
$0.382117 for shares of Series A Preferred, $0.490585 for shares of Series B Preferred, $0.2032 for
shares of Series C Preferred, $0.0778 for shares of Series 1 Preferred, and $0.2032 for shares of Series 2
Preferred. Such initial Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 4(d) below.
No conversion pursuant to this Section 4 shall effect the obligation of the Corporation to pay any declared
but unpaid dividends,

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall
automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Price at the time in effect for
such share immediately upon the earlier of (i) except as provided below in Section 4(c), the Corporation’s
sale of its Common Stock in a firm commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to a registration
statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), the public offering price of
which is not less than $0.50 per share (appropriately adjusted for any stock split, dividend, combination of
other recapitalization) and which results in aggregate cash proceeds to the Corporation of $25,000,000

5V\502382.4
(net of underwriting discounts and commissions) or (ii) the date specified by written consent or agreement
of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a class.

({c) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall
be entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the certificate or
certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for such series
of Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the Corporation at its principal corporate office, of the
election to convert the same and shall state therein the name or names in which the certificate or
certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable
thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or
nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which
such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made
immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of such series of
Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common
Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of
such shares of Common Stock as of such date. If the conversion is in connection with an underwritten
offering of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act the conversion may, at the option of any
holder tendering such Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the
underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering, in which event the person(s) entitled to
receive Common Stock upon conversion of such Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted
such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities.

(d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock for Certain
Dilutive Issuances, Splits and Combinations. The Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock shall be

subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

(i) Issuance of Additional Stock below Purchase Price. If the
Corporation shall issue, after the date on which this Seventh Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the “Filing Date”), any
Additional Stock (as defined below) without consideration or for a consideration per share Jess than the
Conversion Price for such series in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock, the
Conversion Price for such series in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall automatically be
adjusted as set forth in this Section 4(d){i), unless otherwise provided in this Section A(dXi).

(A) Adjustment Formula. Whenever the Conversion Price
is adjusted pursuant to this Section (4)(d)(i), the new Conversion Price shall be determined by multiplying
the Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction, (x) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares
of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance (the “Outstanding Common”) plus the
number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for such
issuance would purchase at such Conversion Price; and (y) the denominator of which shall be the number
of shares of Outstanding Common plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock, For purposes of
the foregoing calculation, the term “Outstanding Common” shall include outstanding warrants,
outstanding options, and other securities convertible into or exerciseable or exchangeable for Common
Stock and whcther vested or unvested. -

(B) Definition of “Additional Stock”. For purposes of this
Section 4(d)(i), “Additional Stock” shall mean any shares of Common Stock issued (or deemed to have

(4) Not including issuances subject to clause

years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward, or shall be made at
the end of three years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward.

than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be deemed to be the fair value thereof as determined in
good faith by the Board of Directors irrespective of any accounting treatment.

(E) Deemed Issuances of Common Stock, In the case of
the issuance (whether before, on or after the Filing Date) of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for

Common Stock deliverable upon exercise (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to exercisability,
including without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account potential antidilution
adjustments) of such options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common Stock shall be deemed to
have been issued at the time such options or rights were issued and for a consideration equa! to the
consideration (determined in the manner provided in Section 4(d)(i)(D)), if any, received by the
Corporation upon the issuance of such options or rights plus the minimum exercise price provided in such
options or rights (without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) for the Common. Stock
covered thereby, .

(2) The aggregate maximum number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of or in exchange (assuming the satisfaction of any
conditions to convertibility or exchangeability, including, without limitation, the passage of time, but
without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) for any such convertible or exchangeable
securities or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or
exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof shall be deemed to have been
issued at the time such securities were issued or such options or rights were issued and for a consideration
equal to the consideration, if any, received by the Corporation for any such securities and related options
of rights (excluding any cash received on account of accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the
minimum additional consideration, if any, to be received by the Corporation (without taking into account
potential antidilution adjustments) upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or the exercise of
any related options or rights (the consideration in each case to be determined in the manner provided in
Section 4(d)(i)(D).

(3) In the event of any change in the number of

shares of Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon exercise of
such options or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such convertible or exchangeable

$V\502382.4
securities, other than a change resulting from the antidilution provisions thereof, the Conversion Price of
each of the Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, rights or
securities, shall be recomputed to reflect such change, but no further adjustment shall be made for the
actual issuance of Common Stock or any payment of such consideration upon the exercise of any such
options or rights or the conversion or exchange of such securities.

(4) Upon the expiration of any such options or
rights, the termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options or rights
related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred
Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, rights or securities or options
or rights related to such securities, shall be recomputed to reflect the issuance of only the number of
shares of Common Stock (and convertible or exchangeable securities which remain in effect) actually
issued upon the exercise of such options or rights, upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or
upon the exercise of the options or rights related to such securities; however, in no case shall the
readjustment have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock to an amount
which exceeds the lower of (i) the Conversion Price for the applicable series of Preferred Stock, as
applicable, immediately prior to the original adjustment date, or (ii) the Conversion Price for the
applicable series of Preferred Stock, as applicable, that would have resulted from any issuance of
Additional Shares between the original adjustment date and such readjustment date.

(5) The number of shares of Common Stock deemed
issucd and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to Sections 4(d)(i)(E)(1) and 4(d)(i)(E)(2)
shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or expiration of the type described in
either Section 4(d)(i)(E)(3) or 4(d)(i)(E)(4).

(F) No Increased Conversion Price. Notwithstanding any
other provisions of this Section (4)(d)(i), except to the limited extent provided for in Sections
4(d)(i)(E)(3) and 4(d)(i)(E)(4), no adjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4(d)(i)
shall have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price above the Conversion Price in effect immediately
prior to such adjustment.

(ii) Stock Splits and Dividends. In the event the Corporation
should at any time or from time to time after the Purchase Date fix a record date for the effectuation of a
split or subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or the determination of holders of
Common Stock entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of
Common Stock or other securities or rights convertible into, or entitling the holder thereof to receive
directly or indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock (hereinafter referred to as “Common Stock
Equivalents”) without payment of any consideration by such holder for the additional shares of Common
Stock or Common Stock Equivalents (including the additional sharcs of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion or exercise thereof), then, as of such record date (or the date of such dividend distribution,
split or subdivision if no record date is fixed), the Conversion Price of each of the Series of Preferred
Stock shall be appropriately decreased so that the number of sharcs of Common Stock issuable on
conversion of each share of such series shall be increased in proportion to such increase of the aggregate
of shares of Common Stock outstanding and those issuable with respect to such Common Stock
Equivalents with the number of shares issuable with respect to Common Stock Equivalents determined
from time to time in the manner provided for deemed issuances in Section 4(d)(i)(E) as provided in
Section 4(d)(iii) below.

(iii) Reverse Stock Splits. If the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding at any time after the Purchase Date is decreased by a combination of the outstanding
shares of Common Stock, then, following the record date of such combination, the Conversion Price for

9
$V\502382.4
each of the Series of Preferred Stock shall be appropriately increased so that the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be decreased in proportion to
such decrease in outstanding shares.

; (e) Other Distributions. In the event the Corporation shall declare a
distribution payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by the Corporation or
other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred to in Section 4(d)(ii),
then, in each such case for the purpose of this Section 4(e), the holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled
to a proportionate share of any such distribution as though they were the holders of the number of shares
of Common Stock of the Corporation into which their shares of Preferred Stock are convertible as of the
record date fixed for the determination of the holders of Common Stock of the Corporation entitled to
receive such distribution.

(f) Recapitalizations. If at any time or from time to time there shall be a
recapitalization of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision, combination or merger or sale of assets
transaction provided for elsewhere in this Section 4 or Section 2) provision shall be made so that the
holders of the Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of each such share of
Preferred Stock the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the Corporation or
otherwise, to which a holder of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of each such share of
Preferred Stock would have been entitled on such recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate
adjustment shal] be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 4 with respect to the rights of
the holders of such Preferred Stock after the recapitalization to the end that the provisions of this Section
4 (including adjustment of the Conversion Price then in effect and the number of shares purchasable upon
conversion of such Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event and be as nearly equivalent as
practicable.

(g) No Impairment, The Corporation will not, by amendment of its
Certificate of Incorporation (except in accordance with applicable law) or through any reorganization,
recapitalization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any
other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be
observed or performed hereunder by the Corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in the
carrying out of all the provisions of this Section 4 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary
or appropriate in order to protect the Conversion Rights of the holders of Preferred Stock against
impairment.

(h) No Fractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments.

(i) No fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of any
share or shares of the Preferred Stock, and the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued shal] be
rounded down to the nearest whole sharc. The number of shares issuable upon such conversion shall be
determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock of each holder at the time
converting into Common Stock and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such aggregate
conversion. If, after the aforementioned aggregation, the conversion would result in the issuance of any
fractional share, the Corporation shall, in lieu of issuing any fractional share, pay cash equal to the
product of such fraction multiplied by the Common Stock’s fair market value (as determined in good faith
by the Board of Directors) on the date of conversion.

(ii) Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the
Conversion Price of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation, at its expense, shall
promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and prepare and
furnish to each holder of such Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment

10
SV1502382.4
and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation
Shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be
furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (A) such adjustment and readjustment and in each
case the factual basis therefor, (B) the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock at the time in
effect, and (C) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at
the time would be received upon the conversion of a share of such series of Preferred Stock,

(i) Notices of Record Date. In the event of any taking by the Corporation
of a record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof who
are entitled to receive any dividend or other distribution, any right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise
acquire any shares of stock of any class or any other securities or property, or to receive any other right,
the Corporation shall mail to each holder of Preferred Stock, at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date
specified therein, a notice specifying the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of
such dividend, distribution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right.

(j) Reseryation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. ‘(he Corporation

shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock,
solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of Preferred Stock, such number of its
shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all
outstanding shares of such series of Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but
unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding
shares of such series of Preferred Stock, in addition to such other remedies as shall be available to the
holder of such Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of
its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number
of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to
obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to this Certificate of Incorporation.

(k) Notices. Any nolice required by the provisions of this Section 4 to be

provision hereof, to notice of any stockholders’ meeting in accordance with the bylaws of the
Corporation, and shall be entitled to vote, together with holders of Common Stock, with respect to any

Corporation shall issue and deliver to such holder, at the place designated by such holder, a certificate or
certificates for the number of full shares of the Common Stock or Preferred Stock, as applicable, to which
such holder is entitled. The person in whose name the certificate for such shares of Common Stock or
Preferred Stock, as applicable, is to be issued shall be deemed to have become a shareholder on the
effective date of the conversion of the Existing Series Preferred (as applicable), unless the transfer books
of the Corporation are closed on that date, in which case such person shall be deemed to have become a
shareholder of record on the next succeeding date on which the transfer books are open.

Preferred to be transferred to the Transferee and further agrees to be bound by Section 8 in respect of such
shares of Existing Series Preferred (the “Transferred Preferred”), provided, however, that the foregoing
restriction shall not be applicable to transfers of Existing Series Preferred to the Corporation in exchange
for shares of the Corporation's capital stock. The Pro Rata Share of a Transferee for purposes of this

Preferred acquired by such Transferee. The Pro Rata Share of a holder of Existing Series Preferred
determined under Section 8 shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect the transfer to a Transferee of such
holder's shares of Existing Series Preferred hereunder.
