of Directors, but only out of funds that are legally available therefor, non-cumulative cash

of Common Stock until all dividends as set forth in Section 1(a) above on the Series A Preferred
Stock, Series A-] Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock shall
have been paid or declared and set apart, except for:

(i) acquisitions of Common Stock by the Corporation pursuant

cost or fair market value) from an employee, consultant or director of the Corporation upon
termination of employment or provision of services to the Corporation; or

(ii) acquisitions of Common Stock in exercise of the
Corporation’s right of first refusal to repurchase such shares provided such repurchase is

$78427 vO/HN -2-
directors elected by the holders of Series C Preferred Stock and including one of the directors
elected by the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock.

The holders of the Preferred Stock expressly waive their rights, if any, as described in California
Code Sections 502, 503 and 506 as they relate to repurchases of shares of Common Stock by the
Corporation upon termination of employment or service of an employee, consultant or director of
the Corporation.

2. Liquidation.

(a) Preference. In the event of any Liquidation Transaction (as defined
below), liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, either voluntary or involuntary,
(a “Liquidation Event”) the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive,
prior and in preference to any distribution of any of the assets of the Corporation to the holders of
Series A Preferred Stock, Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Common
Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount per share equal to the Original Issue Price
per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reclassifications and the like) for each
share of Series C Preferred Stock plus all declared but unpaid dividends thereon. If, upon the
occurrence of such event, the assets and funds thus distributed among the holders of the Series C
Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full aforesaid
preferential amounts, then the entire assets and funds of the Corporation legally available for
distribution shall be distributed ratably among the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock in
proportion to the preferential amount each such holder is otherwise entitled to receive pursuant to
this Section 2(a),

(b) Upon the completion of the distribution required by Section 2(a)
above if assets remain in the Corporation, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, Series A-]
Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, prior and in preference
to any distribution of any of the assets of the Corporation to the holders of Common Stock by
reason of their ownership thereof, an amount per share equal to their respective Original Issue
Prices (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reclassifications and the like) for each share
then held by them, on a pari passu basis, plus all declared but unpaid dividends. If, upon the
occurrence of such event, the assets and funds thus distributed among the holders of the Series A
Preferred Stock, Series A-] Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to
permit the payment to such holders of the full aforesaid preferential amounts, then the entire
assets and funds of the Corporation legally available for distribution shall be distributed ratably
among the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series A-1 Preferred Stock and Series B
Preferred Stock in proportion to the preferential amount each such holder is otherwise entitled to
receive.

(c) Remaining Assets. Upon the completion of the distribution
required by Sections 2(a) and (b) above if assets remain in the Corporation, the holders of the
Common Stock of the Corporation shall receive all of the remaining assets of the Corporation pro
rata based on the number of shares of Common Stock held by each such holder.

(d) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) above, solely for

purposes of determining the amount each holder of shares of Preferred Stock is entitled to receive
with respect to a Liquidation Event, the holder of each share of each series of Preferred Stock

578427 vO/HN -3-
shall be treated as if such holder had converted such holder’s shares of such series into shares of
Common Stock immediately prior to the Liquidation Event if, as a result of an actual conversion
of any series of Preferred Stock (including taking into account the operation of this paragraph (d)
with respect to all series of Preferred Stock), each holder of such series would receive (with
respect to the shares of such series), in the aggregate, an amount greater than the amount that
would be distributed to holders of such series (with respect to the shares of such series) if such
holders had not converted such series of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, If holders
of any series are treated as if they had converted shares of Preferred Stock into Common Stock
pursuant to this paragraph (d), then such holders shall not be entitled to receive any distribution
pursuant to Section 2(a) or (b), as applicable, that would otherwise be made to holders of such
series of Preferred Stock.

(e) Certain Acquisitions.

(i) Deemed Liquidation, For purposes of this Section 2, a
Liquidation Event shall be deemed to occur if the Corporation shall, in a transaction or series of
related transactions: (A) sell, convey, license, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its
assets or business or (B) by means of a merger, consolidation or other acquisition with any other
corporation, limited liability company or other entity (other than a wholly-owned subsidiary of
the Corporation) or the sale of the securities of the Corporation, cause the transfer of in excess of
50% of the voting power of the Corporation (any such transaction, a “Liquidation Transaction”),
provided that none of the following shall be deemed a Liquidation Transaction: (i) a merger
effected exclusively for the purpose of changing the domicile of the Corporation, (ii) a bona fide
equity financing for working capital raising purposes in which the Corporation is the surviving
corporation, or (iii) a transaction in which the stockholders of the Corporation immediately prior
to the transaction own 50% or more of the voting power of the surviving corporation following
the transaction. In the event that the Corporation is a party to Liquidation Transaction, then each
holder of Preferred Stock shal] be entitled to receive, for each share of Preferred Stock then held,
out of the proceeds of such Liquidation Transaction, the greater of the amount of cash, securities
or other property to which such holder would be entitled to receive in a Liquidation Event
pursuant to (1) Section 2(a)or (b) above or (ii) Section 2(d) above, as applicable.

(ii) | Valuation of Consideration. In the event of a deemed
liquidation as described in Section 2(e)(i) above, if the consideration received by the Corporation
is other than cash, its value will be deemed its fair market value, as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors. Any securities shall be valued as follows:

(A) Securities not subject to investment letter or other
similar restrictions on free marketability:

(1) If traded on a securities exchange or The
Nasdaq Stock Market (“‘Nasdaq”’), the value shall be the average of the closing prices over a
thirty (30) day period ending three days before the date of calculation on such exchange or
Nasdaq over a specified time period;

578427 vO/HN -4.
(2) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value
shall be the average of the closing bid or sales price (whichever is applicable) over the thirty (30)
day period ending three days before the date of calculation; and

(3) If there is no active public market, the value
shall be the fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(B) The method of valuation of securities subject to
investment letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely
by virtue of a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an
appropriate discount from the market value determined as specified above in Section 2(e)(ii)(A)
to reflect the approximate fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors.

(iii) Notice of Liquidation Event. The Corporation shall give
each holder of record of Series A Preferred Stock, Series A-] Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred
Stock or Series C Preferred Stock written notice of any impending Liquidation Event not later
than ten (10) calendar days prior to the stockholders’ meeting called to approve such Liquidation
Event, or ten (10) calendar days prior to the closing of such Liquidation Event, whichever is
earlier, and shall also notify such holders in writing of the final approval of such Liquidation
Event. The first of such notices shall describe the material terms and conditions of the
impending Liquidation Event and the provisions of this Section 2, and the Corporation shall
thereafter give such holders prompt notice of any material changes. Unless such notice
requirements are waived in writing by both (i) the holders of at least a majority of the then
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class and (ii) the holders of at
least 55% of the then outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock voting separately as a single
class, the Liquidation Event shall not take place sooner than ten (10) calendar days after the
Corporation has given the first notice provided for herein or sooner than ten (10) calendar days
after the Corporation has given notice of any material changes provided for herein.
Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Restated Certificate, all notice periods or
requirements in this Restated Certificate may be shortened or waived, either before or after the
action for which notice is required, upon the written consent of the holders of a majority of the
voting power of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock that are entitled to such notice rights.

(iv) Effect of Noncompliance. In the event the requirements of
this Section 2(e) are not complied with, the Corporation shall forthwith either cause the closing
of the Liquidation Event to be postponed until the requirements of this Section 2(e) have been
complied with, or cancel such Liquidation Event, in which event the rights, preferences,
privileges and restrictions of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, Series A-1 Preferred Stock,
Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock shall revert to and be the same as such
rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions existing immediately prior to the date of the first
notice referred to in Section 2(e)(iti).

3. Conversion. The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series A-1
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock shall have conversion
rights as follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

578427 vO/HN -5-
(a) Right to Convert to Common Stock. Subject to Section 3(d), each

share of Series A Preferred Stock, Series A-1] Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series
C Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the
date of issuance of such share, at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for such
stock, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined
by dividing the Original Issue Price of each such share of Series A Preferred Stock, Series A-]
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock by the Conversion Price
applicable to such share, determined as hereafter provided, in effect on the date the certificate is
surrendered for conversion. The Conversion Price for shares of Series A Preferred Stock and
Series A-1 Preferred Stock shall be equal to the Original Issue Price for shares of Series A
Preferred Stock and Series A-1 Preferred Stock as set forth in Article [V(B), Section 1(a). The
Conversion Price for shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be equal to the Original Issue Price,
provided, however, that upon the initial issuance of the Series C Preferred Stock, the Conversion
Price of the Series B Preferred Stock shall be equal to $1.0065513064. The Conversion Price for
shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall be equal to the Original Issue Price as set forth in Article
IV(B), Section 1(a). The Conversion Price for each share of Series A Preferred Stock, Series A-1
Preferred Stock, Serics B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock shall be subject to
adjustment as set forth in Section 3(e) below.

(b) Automatic Conversion to Common Stock. Each share of Series A
Preferred Stock, Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred
Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Price at
the time in effect for such share immediately upon the earlier of (i) except as provided below in
Section 3(d), the Corporation’s sale of its Common Stock in a firm commitment underwritten
public offering pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the “Securities Act”), in which the per share price to the public would represent a pre-money
valuation of the Corporation of at least $200 million (calculated on a fully-diluted basis) and
which results in gross cash proceeds to the Corporation of at least $50 million (prior to
underwriting discounts and commissions) or (ii) the date specified by written consent or
agreement of both (A) the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred Stock, Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred
Stock, voting together as a single class and (B) the holders of at least 55% of the then outstanding
shares of Series C Preferred Stock voting separately as a single class.

(c) Right to Convert Series A-1 Preferred Stock to Series A
Preferred Stock. Subject to Section 3(d), each share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock shall be

convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share,
at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for such stock, into one (1) fully paid and
nonassessable share of Series A Preferred Stock (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends,
reclassifications and the like affecting the Series A Preferred Stock in a manner different from the
Series A-] Preferred Stock).

(d) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Series A
Preferred Stock, Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to convert such Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, the holder shall
surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or
of any transfer agent for such series of Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the

578427 vO/IN -6-
Corporation at its principal corporate office, of the election to convert the same and shall state
therein the name or names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock are
to be issued. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such
office to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a
certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be
entitled as aforesaid. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to
the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of such series of Preferred Stock
to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of
such shares of Common Stock as of such date. If the conversion is in connection with an
underwritten public offering of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act the conversion
may, at the option of any holder tendering such Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned
upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering, in which
event any persons entitled to receive Common Stock upon conversion of such Preferred Stock
shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing
of such sale of securities. The above described mechanics applicable to the conversion of shares
of Preferred Stock to Common Stock shall apply equally to the conversion of shares of Series A-]
Preferred Stock to Series A Preferred Stock.

(e) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock for Certain
Dilutive Issuances, Splits and Combinations, The Conversion Price of the Series A Preferred
Stock, Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock shal] be

subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

(i) Issuance of Additional Stock below Purchase Price. If
the Corporation should issue, at any time after the date upon which any shares of Series C
Preferred Stock were first issued (the “Purchase Date”), any Additional Stock (as defined below)
without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the respective Conversion Prices
for the Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to the
issuance of such Additional Stock (a “Qualifying Dilutive Issuance”), the respective Conversion
Prices for the Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior
to each such issuance shall automatically be adjusted as set forth in this Section 3(e)(i), unless
otherwise provided in this Section 3(e)(i).

(A) Adjustment Formula. Whenever the Conversion
Price is adjusted pursuant to this Section 3(e)(i), the new Conversion Price shall be determined
by multiplying the Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction, (x) the numerator of which shall
be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance (the
“Outstanding Common”) plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate
consideration received by the Corporation for such issuance would purchase at such Conversion
Price; and (y) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Outstanding Common
plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock. For purposes of the foregoing calculation,
the term “Outstanding Common” shal] include shares of Common Stock deemed issued pursuant
to Section 3(e)(i)(E) below, but only to the extent the consideration to be paid upon the exercise,
conversion or exchange per share of underlying Common Stock is less than or equal to the per
share consideration for the Additional Stock which has given rise to the Conversion Price
adjustment being calculated.

$78427 vO/HN -7-
(B) Definition of “Additional Stock”. For purposes of
adjustment of the Conversion Price for the Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock
under Section 3(e)(i), “Additional Stock” shall mean any shares of Common Stock issued (or
deemed to have been issued pursuant to Section 3(e)(i)(E)) by the Corporation after the Purchase
Date) other than:

(1) Common Stock issued pursuant to stock
dividends, stock splits or similar transactions, as described in Section 3(e)(ii) hereof;

(2) Asof the “First Closing” as defined in that

the Corporation directly or pursuant to a stock option plan or restricted stock plan approved by
the Board of Directors of the Corporation, including at least one of the directors elected by the
holders of the Series C Preferred Stock and including at least one of the directors elected by the
holders of the Series B Preferred Stock (provided, however, that such amount shall be increased
to reflect any shares of Common Stock (i) not issued pursuant to the rights, agreements, option or
warrants (‘‘Unexercised Options”) as a result of the termination of such Unexercised Options or
(ii) reacquired by the Corporation from employees, directors or consultants at cost (or the lesser
of cost or fair market value) pursuant to agreements which permit the Corporation to repurchase
such shares upon termination of services to the Corporation) and from and after the “Call
Closing,” as defined in the Purchase Agreement up to an additional 10,416,418 shares of
Common Stock issued or issuable to employees, consultants or directors of the Corporation
directly or pursuant to a stock option plan or restricted stock plan approved by the Board of
Directors of the Corporation, including at least one of the directors clected by the holders of the

shares of Common Stock (i) not issued pursuant to the rights, agreements, option or warrants
(“Unexercised Options”) as a result of the termination of such Unexercised Options or (ii)
reacquired by the Corporation from employees, directors or consultants at cost (or the lesser of
cost or fair market value) pursuant to agreements which permit the Corporation to repurchase
such shares upon termination of services to the Corporation);

pursuant to that certain Series C Preferred Stock Purchase Warrant issued to Aquilo Partners on
April 28, 2006.

(C) NoFractional Adjustments. No adjustment of the
Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock shall be made in an amount less than one cent
per share, provided that any adjustments which are not required to be made by reason of this
sentence shal] be carried forward and shall be either taken into account in any subsequent
adjustment made prior to three years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment
being carried forward, or shall be made at the end of three years from the date of the event giving
rise to the adjustment being carried forward.

(D) Determination of Consideration. In the case of
the issuance of Common Stock for cash, the consideration shal! be deemed to be the amount of
cash paid therefor before deducting any reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses

578427 vO/HN -9-
allowed, paid or incurred by the Corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection
with the issuance and sale thereof. In the case of the issuance of the Common Stock for
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be
deemed to be the fair value thereof as determined by in good faith by the Board of Directors of
the Corporation.

(E) Deemed Issuances of Common Stock. In the case
of the issuance (whether before, on or after the applicable Purchase Date) of securities or rights
convertible into, or entitling the holder thereof to receive directly or indirectly, additional shares
of Common Stock (the ‘Common Stock Equivalents'’), the following provisions shall apply for
all purposes of this Section 3(e)(i):

(1) The aggregate maximum number of shares
of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion, exchange or exercise (assuming the satisfaction
of any conditions to convertibility, exchangeability or exercisability, including, without
limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account potential antidilution
adjustments) of any Common Stock Equivalents and subsequent conversion, exchange or
exercise thereof shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such Common Stock
Equivalents were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration, if any, received by
the Corporation for any such Common Stock Equivalents (excluding any cash received on
account of accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the minimum additional consideration, if
any, to be received by the Corporation (without taking into account potential antidilution
adjustments) upon the conversion, exchange or exercise of any Common Stock Equivalents (the
consideration in each case to be determined in the manner provided in Section 3(e)(i)(D)).

(2) In the event of any change in the number of
shares of Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon
conversion, exchange or exercise of any Common Stock Equivalents, other than a change
resulting from the antidilution provisions thereof, the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred
Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such Common Stock Equivalents,
shall be recomputed to reflect such change, but no further adjustment shall be made for the actual
issuance of Common Stock or any payment of such consideration upon the conversion, exchange
or exercise of such Common Stock Equivalents.

(3) | Upon the termination or expiration of the
convertibility, exchangeability or exercisability of any Common Stock Equivalents, the
Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or
computed using such Common Stock Equivaients, shall be recomputed to reflect the issuance of
only the number of shares of Common Stock (and Common Stock Equivalents that remain
convertible, exchangeable or exercisable) actually issued upon the conversion, exchange or
exercise of such Common Stock Equivalents.

(4) The number of shares of Common Stock
deemed issued and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to Section 3(e){i)(E)(1) shall
be appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or expiration of the type described in
either Section 3(e){i)(E)(2) or 3(e)(i)(E)(3).

578427 vO/HN -10-
(F) No Increased Conversion Price, Notwithstanding
any other provisions of this Section 3(e)(i), except to the limited extent provided for in Sections
3(e)(i)(E(2) and 3(e)(i)(E)(3), no adjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section
3(e)(i) shall have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price above the Conversion Price in
effect immediately prior to such adjustment.

(G) Multiple Dilutive Issuances, In the event that the
Corporation issues or sells, or is deemed to have issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common

Stock in a Qualifying Dilutive Issuance (the “First Dilutive Issuance”), then in the event that the
Corporation issues or sells, or is deemed to have issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common
Stock in a Qualifying Dilutive Issuance other than the First Dilutive Issuance as a part of the
same transaction or series of related transactions as the First Dilutive Issuance (a “Subsequent
Dilutive Issuance”), then and in each such case upon a Subsequent Dilutive Issuance the
Conversion Price for the Series B Preferred and Series C Stock shall be reduced to the
Conversion Price that would have been in effect had the First Dilutive Issuance and each
Subsequent Dilutive Issuance al] occurred on the closing date of the First Dilutive Issuance.

(ii) Stock Splits and Dividends. In the event the Corporation
should at any time after the Purchase Date fix a record date for the effectuation of a split or
subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or the determination of holders of
Common Stock entitled to reccive a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of
Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents without payment of any consideration by such
holder for the additional shares of Common Stock or the Common Stock Equivalents (including
the additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof), then, as of
such record date (or the date of such dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no record date
is fixed), the Conversion Price of each of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series A-1 Preferred
Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock shall be appropriately decreased so
that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series
shall be increased in proportion to such increase of the aggregate of shares of Common Stock
outstanding and those issuable with respect to such Common Stock Equivalents with the number
of shares issuable with respect to Common Stock Equivalents determined from time to time in
the manner provided for deemed issuances in Section 3(e)(i)(E).

(iii) Reverse Stock Splits. If the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding at any time after the Purchase Date is decreased by a combination of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock, then, following the record date of such combination, the
Conversion Price for each of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock shall be appropriately increased so that the number
of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be
decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares.

(f Other Distributions. In the event the Corporation shall declare a
distribution payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by the
Corporation or other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred to
in Section 3(e}(i) or 3(e)(ii), then, in each such case for the purpose of this Section 3(f), the
holders of Series A Preferred Stock, Series A-] Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and
Series C Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any such distribution as

$78427 vO/HN -Il-
though they were the holders of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation into
which their shares of Preferred Stock are convertible as of the record date fixed for the
determination of the holders of Common Stock of the Corporation entitled to receive such
distribution.

(g)  Recapitalizations. If at any time or from time to time there shall be
a recapitalization of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision, combination or Liquidation
Event provided for elsewhere in this Section 3 or in Section 2) provision shal] be made so that the
holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and
Series C Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of such Preferred
Stock the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the Corporation or
otherwise, to which a holder of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion would have been
entitled on such recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shal! be made in the
application of the provisions of this Section 3 with respect to the rights of the holders of such
Preferred Stock after the recapitalization to the end that the provisions of this Section 3 (including
adjustment of the Conversion Price then in effect and the number of shares purchasable upon
conversion of such Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event and be as nearly
equivalent as practicable.

(h) Special Mandatory Conversions.

(i) If at any time following the Purchase Date the Corporation
consummates a Future Financing (as defined below) and a holder of shares of Series B Preferred
Stock or Series C Preferred Stock (each, a “ Covered Holder” and collectively, the “Covered
Holders”) does not elect to purchase at least its Pro Rata Share (as defined below) of the
securities offered by the Corporation to the Covered Holders in such Future Financing (a “Non-
Participating Covered Holder”), then such Non-Participating Covered Holder's shares of Series
B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock shall, immediately prior to the consummation of
the Future Financing, automatically and without further action on the part of such Non-
Participating Covered Holder be converted into shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Price
in effect with respect to shares of Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock, as
applicable, immediately prior to the consummation of such Future Financing.

(A) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Covered Holder
holding Series B Preferred Stock participates in the Future Financing, but does not purchase its
full Pro Rata Share (as defined below), then a number of such Covered Holder’s shares of Series
B Preferred Stock equal to (1) the number of shares of the Series B Preferred Stock held by such
Covered Holder multiplied by (2) the percentage of such Covered Holder’s Pro Rata Share that
such Covered Holder did not purchase in the Future Financing (the “Refused Percentage”) shall,
immediately prior to the consummation of the Future Financing, automatically and without
further action on the part of such Covered Holder be converted into shares of Common Stock at
the Conversion Price in effect with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock immediately prior to
such Future Financing. If a Covered Holder holding Series C Preferred Stock participates in the
Future Financing, but does not purchase its full Pro Rata Share, then a number of such Covered
Holder’s shares of Series C Preferred Stock equal to (1) the number of shares of the Series C
Preferred Stock held by such Covered Holder multiplied by (2) the Refused Percentage shall,
immediately prior to the consummation of the Future Financing, automatically and without

578427 vVHN -12-
further action on the part of such Covered Holder be converted into shares of Common Stock at
the Conversion Price in effect with respect to the Series C Preferred Stock immediately prior to
such Future Financing.

(B) Definitions. (1) A ‘Future Financing” shall mean
the sale of shares of equity securities (the “Equity Securities”) by the Corporation after the First
Closing (as defined in the Purchase Agreement), provided, that the Corporation offers each
Covered Holder the right to purchase such Covered Holder’s Pro-Rata Share of such Equity
Securities in a written notice given by the Corporation to each Covered Holder at least ten (10)
days prior to the closing of such Future Financing. (2) Each Covered Holder’s “Pro Rata Share”
of the Equity Securities offered in a Future Financing is equal to: (i) the aggregate number of
shares of Equity Securities allocated by the Board of Directors (including at least one Series C
director and at least one Series B director) for purchase by all of the Covered Holders in the
Future Financing multiplied by (ii) the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the aggregate number of
shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock and Series C
Preferred Stock then held by such Covered Holder divided by (y) the aggregate number of shares
of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock and Series C
Preferred Stock then held by all Covered Holders, each as of immediately prior to such Future
Financing.

(ii) | Notwithstanding the foregoing, or anything else herein to
the contrary, the Call Closing (as defined the Purchase Agreement) shall be deemed to be a
Future Financing and, only with respect to the Call Closing (a) a Covered Holder shall mean
only a Purchaser of Series C Preferred Stock in the First Closing (as defined in the Purchase
Agreement); (b) the shares deemed offered to the Covered Holders shall mean the Call Shares
(as defined in the Purchase Agreement); and (c) no additional notice shall be required other than
what is provided for in the Purchase Agreement with respect to the Call Closing.

(iii) | For purposes of this section (h) any Future Financing (other
than the Call Closing that is deemed a Future Financing under subsection h(ii) hereof) may be
excluded from the terms hereof by the vote or written consent of the holders of at least seventy-
five (75%) of the then outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred
Stock voting together as a single class.

(iv) Notices, All written notices required by this Section 3(h)

(i) No Fractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments.

(i) No fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of
any share or shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock, and the number of shares of Common Stock to be
issued shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share. The number of shares issuable upon
such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of the Series A
Preferred Stock, Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred
Stock the holder is at the time converting into Common Stock and the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such aggregate conversion. If the conversion would result in any
fractional share, the Corporation shall, in lieu of issuing any such fractional share, pay the holder
thereof an amount in cash equal to the fair market value of such fractional share on the date of
conversion, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(ii) | Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of
the Conversion Prices of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series A-] Preferred Stock, Series B

hereof and prepare and furnish to each holder of such Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth
such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or
readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder
of Series A Preferred Stock, Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series C
Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth
(A) such adjustment and readjustment, (B) the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred
Stock at the time in effect, and (C) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if
any, of other property which at the time would be received upon the conversion of a share of
such series of Preferred Stock.

(j) Notices of Record Date. In the event of any taking by the
Corporation of a record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the

class or any other securities or property, or to receive any other right, the Corporation shall mail to
each holder of Series A Preferred Stock, Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or
Series C Preferred Stock, at least ten (10) calendar days prior to the date specified therein, a notice

distribution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right.

of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Series A
Preferred Stock, Series A-] Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred
Stock, such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to
effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of such series of Preferred Stock; and if at any time
the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect
the conversion of all then outstanding shares of such series of Preferred Stock, in addition to such
other remedies as shall be available to the holder of such Preferred Stock, the Corporation will

$78427 vO/HIN -14-
take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient
for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite
stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to this Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation.

(I) Notices. Except as expressly provided otherwise herein, any notice
required by the provisions of this Section 3 to be given to the holders of shares of Preferred Stock
