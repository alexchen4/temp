shall give written notice of the same to the Corporation at its principal executive
offices and shal] surrender the certificate or certificates evidencing such shares,
duly endorsed, at such offices of the Corporation. The Corporation shall, as soon
as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such offices to such holder (A) a
certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which
such holder shall be entitled and (B) payment for any declared but unpaid
dividends on the shares of Preferred Stock converted (as provided in Section 2(f)
above). Any such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately
prior to the close of business on the date of the holder’s surrender of the
certificate or certificates evidencing such holder’s shares of Preferred Stock to be
converted, and such holder shall be treated for all purposes as the holder of the
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion as of such date.

(ii) | Upon the occurrence of any of the events specified in
Section 3(d) above, the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock at issue shall be
6004225604

converted automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares
and whether or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the
Corporation or its transfer agent; provided, however, that the Corporation shall
not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion unless the certificates evidencing such shares of
Preferred Stock are either delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent as
provided below, or the holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that
such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement
salisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss
incurred by it in connection with such certificates. Upon the occurrence of such
automatic conversion of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock at issue, the
holders of such shares of Preferred Stock shall surrender the certificates
Tepresenting such shares at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for
the Preferred Stock. Thereupon, there shall be issued and delivered to each such
holder promptly at such office and in his, her or its name as shown on such
surrendered certificate or certificates, a certificate or certificates for the number of
shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Preferred Stock surrendered
were convertible on the date on which such automatic conversion occurred, and
any declared and unpaid dividends shall be paid in accordance with the provisions
of Section 2(f) above. If an automatic conversion is effected by reason of a
Qualified Initial Public Offering, such conversion may, at the option of any holder
tendering Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with
the underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering, in which event
the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock upon conversion of such
Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until
immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities.

“Purchasers” identified therein and dated as of approximately the Original
Issue Date (as the same may be amended from time to time by its terms,
the “Series C-1 Purchase Agreement”) shall not invoke the provisions of
this Section 3(f) so as to cause any adjustment of any Conversion Price.

(ii) [Reserved.]

(iii) Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock. In
the event the Corporation, at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue
Date, shall issue any Options or Convertible Securities or shall fix a record date
for the determination of holders of any class of securities then entitled to receive
any such Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of shares
(as set forth in the instrument relating thereto without regard to any provisions
contained therein designed to protect against dilution) of Common Stock issuable
upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities and
Options therefor, the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities shall
be deemed to be Additional Shares of Common Stock issued as of the time of
such issue or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of
business on such record date; provided, however, that in any such case in which
Additional Shares of Common Stock are deemed to be issued:

600422560v4

(1) No further adjustments in any Conversion Price
shall be made upon the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities or
shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of such Options or conversion
or exchange of such Convertible Securities;

(2) If such Options or Convertible Securities by their
terms provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any increase or
decrease in the consideration payable to the Corporation, or decrease or
increase in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable, upon the
exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, any Conversion Price computed
upon the original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date
with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall,
upon any such increase or decrease becoming effective, be recomputed to
reflect such increase or decrease insofar as it affects such Options or the
rights of conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities; and
provided, further, that no such adjustment of any Conversion Price shall
affect shares of Common Stock previously issued upon conversion of
shares of Preferred Stock;

(3) | Upon the expiration of any such Options or any
rights of conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which
shall not have been exercised, any Conversion Price computed upon the
original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect
thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon such
expiration, be recomputed as if:

a. In the case of Convertible Securities or
Options for Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of
Common Stock issued were the shares of Common Stock,
if any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or
the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities
and the consideration received therefor was the
consideration actually received by the Corporation for the
issue of all such Options, whether or not exercised, plus the
consideration actually reccived by the Corporation upon
such exercise, or for the issue of all such Convertible
Securities, plus the additional consideration, if any, actually
received by the Corporation upon such conversion or
exchange; and

b. In the case of Options for Convertible
Securities, the only Additional Shares of Common Stock
issued were the shares of Common Stock, if any, actually
issued upon the exercise of such Options and the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities and
the consideration received therefor was the consideration
actually received by the Corporation for the issue of all

13
600422560v4

such Options, whether or not exercised, plus the
consideration actually received by the Corporation upon
such exercise, plus the additional consideration, if any,
actually received by the Corporation upon conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities;

(4) No readjustment pursuant to clauses (2) or (3)
above shal] have the effect of increasing any Conversion Price to an
amount which exceeds the lower of such Conversion Price on the original
adjustment date or the Conversion Price that would have resulted from any
issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock between the original
adjustment date and such readjustment date;

(5) In the case of any Options which expire by their
terms not more than sixty (60) days after the date of issue thereof, no
adjustment of any Conversion Price shall be made until the expiration or
exercise of all such Options, whereupon such adjustment shall be made in
the same manner provided in clause (3) above; and

(6) If any record date shall have been fixed and Options
or Convertible Securities are not issued on the date fixed therefor, the
adjustment previously made in any Conversion Price which became
effective on such record date shall be canceled as of the close of business
on such record date, and shall instead be made on the actual date of
issuance, if any.

(iv) Adjustment of Conversion Prices Upon Issuance of

Additional Shares of Common Stock.

(1) In the event that this Corporation, at any time after
the Original Issue Date, shall issue Additional Shares of Common Stock
(including Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued
pursuant to Section 3(f)(iii)), for an amount of consideration per share (the
“Lower Price”) which is less than the Series C-1 Conversion Price in
effect on the date of, and immediately prior to, such issue, then and in
such event, the Series C-1 Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently
with such issue, as of the opening of business on the date of such issue, to
the Lower Price.

(2) In the event that this Corporation, at any time after
the Original Issue Date, shall issue Additional Shares of Common Stock
(including Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued
pursuant to Section 3(f(iii)) for an amount of consideration per share
which is less than any Conversion Price (other than the Series C-I
Conversion Price) in effect on the date of, and immediately prior to, such
issue, then and in such event, such Conversion Price shall be reduced,
concurrently with such issue, as of the opening of business on the date of
600422560v4

such issue, to a price determined by multiplying such then applicable
Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale by a

fraction:

(v)

a. the numerator of which shall be (A) the
number of shares of Common Stock deemed outstanding
(as provided below) immediately prior to such issue or sale,
plus (B) the number of shares of Common Stock which the
aggregate consideration received (as determined in Section
3(f)(v) below) by the Corporation for the total number of
Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued would
purchase at such then applicable Conversion Price, and

b. the denominator of which shall be the
number of shares of Common Stock deemed outstanding
(as provided below) immediately prior to such issue or sale
plus the total number of Additional Shares of Common
Stock so issued.

For the purposes of the preceding sentence, the number of
shares of Common Stock deemed outstanding as of a given
date shall be the sum of (A) the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding, (B) the number of shares of
Common Stock into which the then outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock could be converted if fully converted on
the day immediately preceding the given date, and (C) the
number of shares of Common Stock which could be
obtained through the exercise or conversion of all Options
and Convertible Securities outstanding on the day
immediately preceding the given date.

Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this

Section 3(f), the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any
Additional Shares of Common Stock shall be computed as follows:

(1) Cashand Property. Such consideration shall:

a. Insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at
the aggregate amount of cash received by the Corporation
(excluding amounts paid or payable for accrued interest or
accrued dividends);

b. Insofar as it consists of property other than
cash, be computed at the fair value thereof at the time of
such issue, as determined in good faith by the Board; and

c. In the event Additional Shares of Common
Stock are issued together with other shares or securities or

15
600422560v4

other assets of the Corporation for consideration which
covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so
received, computed as provided in clauses a and b above, as
determined in good faith by the Board.

(2) Options and Convertible _ Securities. The
consideration per share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares
of Common Stock deemed to have been issued pursuant to the provisions
of Section 3(f(iii) above, relating to Options and Convertible Securities,
shall be determined by dividing:

a. The total amount, if any, received or
receivable by the Corporation as consideration for the issue
of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the
minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as
set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard
to any provision contained therein designed to protect
against dilution) payable to the Corporation upon the
exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of
such Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for
Convertible Securities. the exercise of such Options for
Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of
such Convertible Securities, by

b. The maximum number of shares of
Common Stock (as set forth in the instruments relating
thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein
designed to protect against dilution) issuable upon the
exercise of such Options and conversion or exchange of
such Convertible Securities.

(g) Adjustments to Conversion Prices for Stock Dividends and_for

Combinations or Subdivisions of Common Stock. In the event that the

Corporation, at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date, shall
declare or pay, without consideration, any dividend on the Common Stock
payable in Common Stock or in any right to acquire Common Stock for no
consideration, or shall effect a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common
Stock into a greater number of shares of Common Stock (by stock split,
reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in Common Stock or
in any right to acquire Common Stock), or in the event the outstanding shares of
Common Stock shall be combined or consolidated, by reclassification or
otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then each
Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such event shall, concurrently
with the effectiveness of such event, be proportionately decreased or increased, as
appropriate.

16
600422560v4

(h) Adjustments for Reclassification and Reorganization. If the
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of shares of Preferred Stock shall be
changed into the same or a different number of shares of any other class or classes
of stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other
than a subdivision or combination of shares provided for in Section 3(g) above or
an Acquisition provided for in Section 1(g) above), each Conversion Price then in
effect shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such reorganization or
reclassification, be proportionately adjusted so that Preferred Stock shall be
convertible into, in lieu of the number of shares of Common Stock which the
holders of Preferred Stock would otherwise have been entitled to receive, a
number of shares of such other class or classes of stock equivalent to the number
of shares of Common Stock that would have been subject to receipt by the holders
of Preferred Stock upon the conversion of Preferred Stock immediately before
such change. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the
application of the provisions of this Section 3 with respect to the rights of the
holders of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock after the reorganization or
reclassification to the end that the provisions of this Section 3 (including the
provisions regarding adjustment of the Conversion Prices then in effect and the
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event as nearly equivalent
as may be practicable.

(i) No Impairment. Without the requisite stockholder approval
(including as may be required by Section 6 below), the Corporation will not, by
amendment of its Certificate of Incorporation or through any reorganization,
transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or
any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance
of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Corporation, but
will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this
Section 3 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate
in order to protect the Conversion Rights against impairment.

(j) Certificates as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each
adjustment or readjustment of any Conversion Price pursuant to the provisions of
this Section 3, the Corporation, at its expense, shall promptly compute such
adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms of this Section 3 and
prepare and furnish to each holder of shares of Preferred Stock a certificate
executed by the Corporation’s President or Chief Financial Officer setting forth
such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such
adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon the written
request at any time of any holder of shares of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to
be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and
readjustments, (ii) the Conversion Prices at the time in effect and (iii) the number
of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the
time would be received upon the conversion of shares of Series C-1 Preferred
Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series A-1 Preferred
Stock and Series A Preferred Stock.

7
(k) Issue Taxes. The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and other
taxes that may be payable in respect of any issue or delivery of shares of Common
Stock on conversion of shares of Preferred Stock pursuant hereto; provided,
however, that the Corporation -shall not be obligated to pay any transfer taxes
resulting from any transfer requested by any holder (whether in connection with
any such conversion or otherwise).

() Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation
shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued

shares of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, such number of shares of Common Stock
as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but
unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such
corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as
shall be sufficient for such purpose (including engaging in best efforts to obtain
the requisite stockholder approval to effect any such action).

(m) Fractional Shares. No fractional share shall be issued upon the
conversion of any share of Preferred Stock. Rather, all shares of Common Stock
(including fractions thereof) issuable upon conversion of more than one share of
Preferred Stock by a holder thereof shall be aggregated for purposes of
determining whether the conversion would result in the issuance of any fractional
share. If, after the aforementioned aggregation, the conversion would result in the
issuance of a fraction of a share of Common Stock, the Corporation shall, in lieu
of issuing any fractional share, pay the holder otherwise entitled to such fraction a
sum in cash equal to the fair market value of such fraction on the date of
conversion (as determined in good faith by the Board).

4. Redemption. The Corporation shall be obligated to redeem the Series C-1

Preferred Stock and the Series C Preferred Stock as follows:

600422560v4

(a) Generally. The holders of at least a majority of the outstanding
Series C-1 Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock (voting or taking action
as one class) may require the Corporation, to the extent it may lawfully do so, to
redeem all (but not less than all) of the outstanding shares of the Series C-1
Preferred Stock and the Series C Preferred Stock in three (3) annual installments
beginning at any time following December 22, 2010 and ending on (and
including) the date two (2) years following such first redemption date (each a
“Redemption Date”); provided, however, that the Corporation shall receive, at
least sixty (60) days prior to the first such Redemption Date, a written request for
such redemption from such holders. The Corporation shall effect such
redemptions on the applicable Redemption Dates by paying in cash, (i) in
exchange for the shares of Series C-1 Preferred Stock to be redeemed, a sum
equal to $0.86 per share of Series C-1 Preferred Stock (as appropriately adjusted

18
6004225604

for any stock dividends, combinations, splits or similar events affecting or with
respect to such shares) plus any declared but unpaid dividends with respect to
such shares (such amount being hereinafter referred to as the “Series C-1
Redemption Price”), and (ii) in exchange for the shares of Series C Preferred
Stock to be redeemed, a sum equal to $0.86 per share of Series C Preferred Stock
(as appropriately adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits or similar
events affecting or with respect to such shares) plus any declared but unpaid
dividends with respect to such shares (such amount being hereinafter referred to
as the “Series C Redemption Price”). The maximum number of shares of Series
C-1 Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock that the Corporation shall be
required to redeem on any one Redemption Date with respect to each holder of
Serics C-1 Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock shall be equal to the
amount determined by dividing (x) the aggregate number of shares of Series C-1
Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock held by such holder by (y) the
number of remaining Redemption Dates (including the Redemption Date to which
such calculation applies). If the Corporation is legally able to redeem some, but
not all. of the shares of Series C-] Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock
required to be redeemed as of any Redemption Date, then the number of shares of
Series C-1 Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock to be redeemed from
each holder shall be determined on a pro rata basis (based upon the aggregate
proceeds to be received by each such holder in respect of the redemption). The
Corporation shall redeem the remaining shares at issue as soon as sufficient funds
are legally available.

(b) Notices. At least ninety (90) days prior to December 22, 2010, the
Corporation shall send a notice (a “Redemption Notice”) to all holders of Series
C-1 Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock setting forth: (i) the expected
Series C-1 Redemption Price and Series C Redemption Price; (ii) a summary of
the procedures to trigger redemption of the Series C-1 Preferred Stock and the
Series C Preferred Stock (including the requirement, pursuant to Section 4(a)
above, that at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Series C-1 Preferred
Stock and Series C Preferred Stock, voting or taking action as one class, request
such redemption); (ili) the financial condition of the Corporation as it relates to
the Corporation’s ability to effect such a redemption; and (iv) the place at which
holders of Series C-1 Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock may obtain
payment of the Series C-1 Redemption Price or the Series C Redemption Price.
respectively, upon surrender of their share certificates. If the Corporation does
not have, or anticipates that it will not have, sufficient funds legally available to
redeem all shares to be redeemed at the first possible Redemption Date, the
Corporation shall so indicate in the Redemption Notice.

(c) Mechanics of Redemption.

(i) On or prior to each Redemption Date, the Corporation shall
deposit the Series C-1 Redemption Price and the Series C Redemption Price of all
shares of Series C-1 Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock to be redeemed
on such Redemption Date with a bank or trust company having aggregate capital

19
600422560v4

and surplus in excess of $100,000.000.00, as a trust fund, with irrevocable
instructions and authority to the bank or trust company to pay, on and after such
Redemption Date, the Series C-1 Redemption Price of all shares of Series C-1
Preferred Stock and the Series C Redemption Price of all shares of Series C
Preferred Stock to be redeemed to their respective holders upon the surrender of
their share certificates. Any moneys deposited by the Corporation pursuant to this
Section 4(c) for the redemption of shares of Series C-1 Preferred Stock or
Series C Preferred Stock thereafter converted into shares of Common Stock
pursuant to Section 3 above no later than the fifth (5") day preceding the
Redemption Date shall be returned to the Corporation forthwith upon such
conversion. The balance of any funds deposited by the Corporation pursuant to
this Section 4(c) remaining unclaimed at the expiration of six (6) months
following such Redemption Date shall be returned to the Corporation promptly
upon its written request.

(ii) On or after each Redemption Date, each holder of shares of
Series C-1 Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock to be redeemed as of
such Redemption Date shall surrender such holder’s certificates representing such
shares to the Corporation in the manner and at the place designated in the
Redemption Notice, and thereupon the applicable Redemption Price of such
shares shall be payable to the order of the person whose name appears on such
certificate or certificates as the owner thereof and each surrendered certificate
shall be canceled. In the event that less than all the shares represented by such
certificates are redeemed, a new certificate (or new certificates) shall be issued
representing the unredeemed shares. From and after such Redemption Date,
unless there shall have been a default in payment of the applicable Redemption
Price or the Corporation is unable to pay the applicable Redemption Price due to
not having sufficient legally available funds, all rights of the holders of such
shares as holders of Series C-1 Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock
(except the right to receive the applicable Redemption Price without interest upon
surrender of their certificates) shall cease and terminate with respect to such
shares; provided, however, that in the event that shares of Series C-1 Preferred
Stock and Series C Preferred Stock are not redeemed due to a default in payment
by the Corporation or because the Corporation does not have sufficient funds
legally available, such shares of Series C-1 Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred
Stock shall remain outstanding and shall be entitled to all of the rights and
preferences provided herein unless and until such shares are redeemed.

(iii) In the event of a request for redemption of shares of Series
C-1 Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock as provided in Section 4(a)
above, the Conversion Rights (as defined in Section 3 above) for such shares of
Series C-1 Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock to be redeemed as of any
Redemption Date shall terminate at the close of business on the fifth (5) day
preceding such Redemption Date, unless default is made in payment of the
applicable Redemption Price.

20
600422560v4

5. Voting Rights; Election of Directors.

(a) Voting Rights. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein
(including in Section 6 below) or as required by law, (a) each holder of shares of
Preferred Stock shall (i) be entitled to that number of votes equal to the number of
shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Preferred Stock could then be
converted (pursuant to the provisions of Section 3(c) above) and (ii) have voting
rights and powers with respect thereto which are equal to the voting rights and
powers of the holders of shares of Common Stock, and (b) holders of shares of
Preferred Stock shall vote together with the holders of shares of Common Stock
as a single class with respect to any matter upon which holders of Common Stock
are entitled to vote and shall be entitled to notice of any stockholders’ meeting in

In furtherance of and not in limitation of powers conferred by statute, it is further
provided that:

A. Subject to the limitations and exceptions, if any, contained in this

ARTICLE VI.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, no director of the Corporation shall be personally
liable to the Corporation or to any of its stockholders for damages arising out of such director’s
breach of his or her fiduciary duty as a director of the Corporation, except to the extent that the
elimination or limitation of such liability is not permitted by the Delaware General Corporation
Law (the “DGCL”), or in the event a judgment or other final adjudication adverse to such
director establishes that his or her acts or omissions were in bad faith or involved intentional
misconduct or a knowing violation of law or that he or she personally gained in fact a financial
profit or other advantage to which he or she was not legally entitled. This Article VI shall not
affect any other provision permitted under the DGCL in this Certificate of Incorporation, the
Corporation’s Bylaws or any contract or resolution of the Corporation indemnifying or agreeing
to indemnify a director against personal liability. No amendment to or repeal of the provisions
of this Article VI shall deprive any director of the Corporation of the benefit hereof with respect
to any act or failure to act of such director occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.

ARTICLE VIL.

A. The Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, indemnify
each person who at any time is, or shall have been, a director or officer of the
Corporation and was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened,

26
600422560v4
pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of the
Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise (all such persons being referred to hereinafter as an “Indemnitee”), or by
reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in such capacity, against all
expenses (including attorneys’ fees). judgments, fincs and amounts paid in settlement
incurred in connection with any such action, suit or proceeding, to the maximum extent
permitted by the DGCL.

B. Each Indemnitee shall notify the Corporation in wnting as soon as
practicable of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation involving him or her for which
indemnity will or could be sought. With respect to any action, suit, proceeding or
investigation of which the Corporation is so notified, the Corporation will be entitled to
participate therein at its own expense as well as to assume the defense thereof at its own
expense, with legal counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee.

C. In the event that the Corporation does not assume the defense of any
action, suit, proceeding or investigation of which the Corporation receives notice under
this Article VII, the Corporation shall advance from time to time any expenses (including
reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred by an Indemnitee in defending a civil or criminal
action, suit, proceeding or investigation or any appeal therefrom; provided, however, that
the payment of such expenses incurred by an Indemnitee in advance of the final
disposition of such matter shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by or on
behalf of the Indemnitee to repay all amounts so advanced in the event that it shall
ultimately be determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the
Corporation as authorized in this Article VII, which undertaking shall be accepted
without reference to the financial ability of the Indemnitee to make such repayment; and
provided, further, that no such advancement of expenses shall be made if it is determined
that (1) the Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably
believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, or (2) with
respect to any criminal action or proceeding, the Indemnitee had reasonable cause to
believe his or her conduct was unlawful.

D. In any suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification
or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or by the Corporation to recover an
advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving
that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses,
under this Article VII or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.

E. Except for any suit contemplated by the foregoing Section D, the
Corporation shall not indemnify an Indemnitee secking indemnification in connection
with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such Indemnitee unless the initiation
thereof was approved by the Board. In addition, the Corporation shall not indemnify an
Indemnitee to the extent such Indemnitee is reimbursed from the proceeds of insurance,
and in the event the Corporation makes any indemnification payments to an Indemnitee
and such Indemnitee is subsequently reimbursed from the proceeds of insurance, such

27
600422560v4
Indemnitee shall promptly refund such indemnification payments to the Corporation to
the extent of such insurance reimbursement.

F. All determinations hereunder as to the entitlement of an Indemnitee to
indemnification or advancement of expenses shall be made in each instance by (i) a
majority vote of the directors of the Corporation consisting of persons who are not at that
time parties to the action, suit or proceeding in question, whether or not a quorum, (ii) a
majority vote of a quorum of the outstanding shares of stock of all classes entitled to vote
for directors, voting as a single class, which quorum shall consist of stockholders who are
not at that time parties to the action, suit or proceeding in question, (iii) independent legal
counsel (who may, to the extent permitted by law, be regular legal counsel to the
Corporation) or (iv) a court of competent jurisdiction.

G. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself
and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or its subsidiary or
affiliate, or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise
against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the
power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the DGCL.

H. The foregoing right of indemnification (i) shall in no way be exclusive of
any other nights of indemnification to which any such director or officer may be entitled,
under any Bylaw, agreement, vote of directors or stockholders or otherwise and (ii) shall
inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of the Indemnitees. The
Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board, grant
indemnification rights to other employees or agents of the Corporation or other persons
serving the Corporation and such rights may be equivalent to, or greater or less than,
those set forth in this Article VII. No amendment to or repeal of the provisions of this
Article Vil shall deprive a director or officer of the benefit hereof with respect to any act
or failure to act occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.

ARTICLE VIII.

The Corporation reserves the right at any time to amend, alter, change or repeal any
provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation in the manner now or hereafter prescribed
by statute and this Certificate of Incorporation, and all rights conferred upon stockholders herein,
are granted subject to this reservation and, except as set forth in Articles VI and VII, all rights,
preferences and privileges of whatsoever nature conferred upon stockholders, directors or any
other person whomsoever by and pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation in its present form
or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the right reserved in this Article VIII.
