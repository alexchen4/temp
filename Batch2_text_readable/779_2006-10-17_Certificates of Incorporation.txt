Company shall have authority to issue is 25,170,221, 20,000,000 shares of which shall be
Common Stock with the par value of $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”), and
5,170,221 shares of which shall be Preferred Stock with the par value of $0.0001 per share. The
Preferred Stock may be issued in one or more series. Of the Preferred Stock, 500,000 shares
shall be designated Series A-1 Preferred Stock (the “Series A-1 Preferred’), and 4,670,221
shares shall be designated Series A-2 Preferred Stock (the “Series A-2 Preferred” and together
with the Series A-1 Preferred, the “Preferred Stock’).

B. The terms and provisions of the Preferred Stock and Common Stock are as
follows:
1. Dividends.
(a) Treatment of Series A-1 Preferred and Series A-2 Preferred. The holders

of the Series A-1 Preferred and Series A-2 Preferred, in preference to the holders of any other
stock of the Company, shall be entitled to receive, when and as declared by the Board of

-2-
$V1923398.4
Directors, but only out of funds that are legally available therefor, non-cumulative cash
dividends at the rate of $0.0150 and $0.0209, respectively, per annum on each outstanding share
of Series A-1 Preferred and Series A-2 Preferred (as adjusted for stock splits, combinations,

reorganizations and the like with respect to the Series A-1 Preferred and Series A-2 Preferred,
respectively).

(b) Treatment of Common Stock. After payment of the dividends provided by
Section 1(a), any additional dividends declared shall be distributed among all holders of
Common Stock and Preferred Stock in proportion to the number of shares.of Common Stock
held by each such holder (or with respect to a holder of Preferred Stock the number of shares of
Common Stock into which the holder’s Preferred Stock is convertible). No dividends shall be
declared or paid on the Common Stock unless and until the holders of Preferred Stock shall have

received all unpaid dividends to which they are entitled under this Section 1 (whether or not
declared).

(c) Other Distributions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, in the event the Company shall make or issue, or shall fix a record date for the -
determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution
with respect to Common Stock payable in (i) securities of the Company other than shares of
Common Stock or (ii) assets, then, and in each such event, the holders of Series A-1 Preferred
and Series A-2 Preferred shall receive prior to and in preference to any such dividend or
distribution on the Common Stock securities and assets in amounts equivalent to the cash that
would have been required to be distributed pursuant to Section 1(a) (whether or not declared),
and then the holders of Preferred Stock shall receive, at the same time distribution is made to the
holders of Common Stock, the number of securities or other assets which they would have
received had their Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock, immediately prior to the
record date for determining holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such distribution.

(d) Consent to Certain Repurchases. As authorized by Section 402.5(c) of the
General Corporation Law of California, Sections 502 and 503 of the General Corporation Law of
California, to the extent otherwise applicable, shall not apply with respect to Distributions (as
hereinafter defined) made by the Company in connection with the repurchase of shares of
Common Stock issued to or held by employees, consultants, officers or directors at a price not
greater than the amount paid by such person for such shares upon termination of their
employment or services pursuant to agreements providing for the right of said repurchase or
upon exercise of a right of first refusal, which agreements were authorized by the Board of
Directors. For purposes of this Section 1(d), “Distribution” means the transfer of cash, property
or securities without consideration, whether by way of dividend or otherwise, or the purchase of
shares of the Company (other than in connection with the repurchase of shares of Common Stock
issued to or held by employees, consultants, officers or directors at a price not greater than the
amount paid by such persons for such shares upon termination of their employment or services
pursuant to agreements providing for the right of said repurchase or upon exercise of a right of
first refusal approved by the Board of Directors) for cash or property.

5V\523398.4
2. Liquidation Rights.

(a) Liquidation Preference. In the event of any Liquidation (as hereinafter
defined), whether voluntary or involuntary, before any distribution or payment shall be made to
the holders of Common Stock, the holders of Series A-1 Preferred and Series A-2 Preferred shall
be entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Company, prior and in preference to the holders of
the Common Stock, an amount per share of Series A-1 Preferred or Series A-2 Preferred equal to
(i) $0.2500 plus all declared and unpaid dividends on the Series A-1 Preferred (as adjusted for
stock splits, combinations, reorganizations and the like with respect to the Series A-1 Preferred)
for each share of Series A-1 Preferred held by them and (ii) $0.3480 plus all declared and unpaid
dividends on the Series A-2 Preferred (as adjusted for stock splits, combinations, reorganizations
and the like with respect to the Series A-2 Preferred) for each share of Series A-2 Preferred held
by them. If, upon any such Liquidation, the assets of the Company shall be insufficient to make
payment in full to all holders of Series A-1 Preferred and Series A-2 Preferred of the liquidation
preference set forth in this Section 2(a), then such assets shall be distributed among the holders
of Series A-1 Preferred and Series A-2 Preferred at the time outstanding, ratably in proportion to
the full amounts to which they would otherwise be entitled.

(b) Remaining Assets. After the payment to the holders of the Preferred
Stock of the full preferential amount specified above, any remaining assets of the Company shall
be distributed pro rata among the holders of the Common Stock and the holders of the Preferred
Stock on a pari passu basis according to the number of shares of Common Stock held by such
holders, where each holder of shares of Preferred Stock shall be treated for this purpose as
holding the greatest whole number of shares of Common Stock then issuable upon conversion of
all shares of Preferred Stock held by such holder pursuant to Section 3.

(c) Liquidation. A “Liquidation” shall mean the liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Company and, if so approved by the holders of a majority of the Preferred
Stock then outstanding, voting together as a single separate class (on an as-converted to
Common Stock basis), also shall be deemed to include (i) any reorganization, merger,
consolidation or similar transaction (or series of related transactions)in which the outstanding
capital stock of the Company immediately prior to such transaction or series of related
transactions represents less than a majority of the voting power of (1) the surviving entity, or (2)
the parent of such surviving entity if the surviving entity is owned by such parent , immediately
following such transaction or series of related transactions; (ii) any transaction or series of
related transactions to which the Company is a party in which in excess of fifty percent (50%) of
the Company’s voting power is transferred; and (iii) a sale, lease, exclusive license or other
disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; provided that a Liquidation
shall not include any transaction or series of related transactions principally for bona fide equity
financing purposes in which cash is received by the Company or any successor or indebtedness
of the Company is cancelled or converted or a combination thereof occurs.

(d) Determination of Value if Proceeds Other than Cash. In any Liquidation,

if the proceeds received by the Company or its stockholders are other than cash, its value will be
deemed its fair market value. Any securities shall be valued as follows:

SV\523398.4
(i) Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar
restrictions on free marketability covered by (ii) below:

(A) If traded on a securities exchange or through the Nasdaq
National Market, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the
securities on such exchange or system over the twenty (20) trading-day period ending three (3)
trading days prior to the closing of the Liquidation;

(B) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the
twenty (20) trading-day period ending three (3) trading days prior to the closing of the
Liquidation; and

(C) If there is no active public market, the value shall be the
fair market value thereof, as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company.

(ii) | The method of valuation of securities subject to investment letter
or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of a
stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount
from the market value determined as above in (i) (A), (B) or (C) to reflect the approximate fair
market value thereof, as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company.

3. Conversion. The Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as follows:

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at
the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share at the office
of the Company or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock. Each share of Series A-1 Preferred
and Series A-2 Preferred shall be convertible into that number of fully-paid and nonassessable
shares of Common Stock that is equal to $0.2500 and $0.3480, respectively (each as adjusted for
stock splits, combinations, reorganizations and the like with respect to such shares) divided by .
the applicable Conversion Price (as hereinafter defined) for such series-of Preferred Stock. The
“Conversion Price” per share of Series A-1 Preferred and Series A-2 Preferred shall initially be
$0.2500 and $0.3480, respectively, subject to adjustment as provided herein.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically
be converted into shares of Common Stock at the then effective Conversion Price for such series
of Preferred Stock immediately upon (i) the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class on an as-converted
basis), or (ii) the consummation of a firm commitment underwritten public offering with a
nationally recognized investment bank of shares of the Company’s Common Stock pursuant to
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), on Form S-1 (as defined in the
Securities Act) or any successor form resulting in the Company-having a market capitalization
(as determined by multiplying the offering price per share to the public by the number of shares _
of Common Stock outstanding immediately following the public offering) of at least
$50,000,000.

$V\523398.4
(c) Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be
issued upon conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder
would otherwise be entitled, the Company shall pay the fair market value cash equivalent of such
fractional share as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. For such purpose, all
shares of Common Stock (including fractions thereof) issuable upon conversion of more than
one share of Preferred Stock by a holder thereof shall be aggregated, and any resulting fractional
share of Common Stock shall be paid in cash. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to convert the same into full shares of Common Stock, and to receive certificate(s)
therefor, it shall surrender the Preferred Stock certificate or certificates, duly endorsed, at the
office of the Company or of any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, and shall give written
notice to the Company at such office that such holder elects to convert such shares; provided,
however, that in the event of an automatic conversion pursuant to paragraph 3(b) above, the
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically without any further action
by the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates representing such shares are
surrendered to the Company or its transfer agent; and provided further, however, that the
Company shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon such automatic conversion unless either the certificates evidencing such shares of
Preferred Stock are delivered to the Company or its transfer agent as provided above, or the
holder notifies the Company or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or
destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Company to indemnify the Company
from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates.

In the event that there are any declared and unpaid dividends on any Preferred Stock
converted pursuant to paragraph 3(a) or 3(b), the Company shall issue to the holder of the
Preferred Stock converted pursuant to paragraph 3(a) or 3(b) that number of fully-paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock that is equal to the amount of such dividends divided by

the per share fair market value of the Common Stock as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors.

The Company shall, as. soon as practicable after delivery of the Preferred Stock
certificate(s), issue and deliver to such holder of Preferred Stock, a certificate or certificates for
the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled and a check
payable to the holder in the amount of any cash amounts payable as the result of a conversion
into fractional shares of Common Stock. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made
immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred
Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of
such shares of Common Stock on such date; provided, however, that if the conversion is in
connection with an underwritten offer of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act, the
conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering Preferred Stock for conversion, be
conditioned upon the closing of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering, in which event
the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of the
Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately
prior to the closing of the sale of such securities.

S$V\523398.4
All shares of Preferred Stock which shall have been surrendered for conversion as herein
provided shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares,
including the rights, if any, to receive notices and to vote, shall immediately cease and terminate,
except only the right of the holders thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange
therefor and to receive payment of any dividends declared but unpaid thereon. Any shares of
Preferred Stock so converted shall be retired and cancelled and shall not be reissued as shares of
such series, and the Company (without the need for stockholder action) may from time to time

take such appropriate action as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of
Preferred Stock accordingly. -

Upon any such conversion, no adjustment to the applicable Conversion Price shall be
made for any declared but unpaid dividends on any series of Preferred Stock surrendered for
conversion or on the Common Stock delivered upon conversion.

(d) Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of Common. If at any time
or from time to time on or after the date that the first share of Preferred Stock is issued (the
“Original Issue Date”), the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided (by stock
split, stock dividend or otherwise), into a greater number of shares of Common Stock without a
corresponding subdivision of the Preferred Stock, the applicable Conversion Price in effect for
each series of Preferred Stock immediately prior to such subdivision shall, concurrently with the
effectiveness of such subdivision, be proportionately decreased. If at any time or from time to
time on or after the Original Issue Date, if the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be
combined (by reclassification or otherwise) into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock
without a corresponding combination of the Preferred Stock, the applicable Conversion Price in
effect for each series of Preferred Stock immediately prior to such combination shall,
concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination, be proportionately increased.

(e) Adjustments for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. If at any
time or from time to time on or after the Original Issue Date, the Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares
of any other class or classes of securities, whether by capital reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification or other event (other than a subdivision or combination of shares pursuant to
Section 3(d) above), concurrently with the effectiveness of such capital reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification or other event, each series of Preferred Stock shall be ©
convertible into, in lieu of the number of shares of Common Stock which the holders would
otherwise have been entitled to receive, a number of shares of such other class or classes of
securities equivalent to the number of such shares or securities that would have been received by
the holder of a number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such series of
Preferred Stock immediately prior to such capital reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification
or other event. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the
provisions of this Section 3 with respect to the rights of the holders of Preferred Stock after the
capital reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other event to the end that the
provisions of this Section 3 (including adjustment of the applicable Conversion Price then in
effect for each series of Preferred Stock and the number and type of shares or other securities
issuable upon conversion of each series of Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event
and be as nearly equivalent as practicable.

$W\523398.4
(f) Adjustment for Common Stock Dividends and Distributions. If at any
time or from time to time on or after the Original Issue Date, the Company shall make or issue,
or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a
dividend or other distribution payable on the Common Stock in additional shares of Common
Stock, then and in each such event the applicable Conversion Price for each series of Preferred
Stock in effect immediately before such event shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance
or, in the event such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such

record date, by multiplying the applicable Conversion Price then in effect for each series of
Preferred Stock by a fraction equal to: -

(1) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the
close of business on such record date, and

(2) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the
close of business on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in
payment of such dividend or distribution;

provided, however, that if such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend is not fully
paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the applicable Conversion
Price for each series of Preferred Stock shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of
business on such record date and thereafter the applicable Conversion Price for each series of
Preferred Stock shall be adjusted pursuant to this subsection as of the time of actual payment of
such dividends or distributions; and provided further, however, that no such adjustment shall be
made if the holders of Preferred Stock simultaneously receive (i) a dividend or other distribution
of shares of Common Stock in a number equal to the number of shares of Common Stock as they
would have received if all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock had been converted into
Common Stock on the date of such event or (ii) a dividend or other distribution of shares of
Preferred Stock which are convertible, as of the date of such event, into such number of shares of
Common Stock as is equal to the number of additional shares of Common Stock being issued
with respect to each share of Common Stock in such dividend or distribution.

(g) Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. If at any time or from.
time to time on or after the Original Issue Date, the Company shall make or issue, or fix a record
date for the determination of holders of capital stock of the Company entitled to receive, a
dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the Company (other than a distribution of
shares of Common Stock in respect of outstanding shares of Common Stock) or in other property
and the provisions of Section 3(f) do not apply to such dividend or distribution, then and in each
such event the holders of Preferred Stock shall receive, simultaneously with the distribution to
the holders of such capital stock, a dividend or other distribution of such securities or other
property in an amount equal to the amount of such securities or other property as they would
have received if all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock had been converted into Common
Stock on the date of such event.

(h) Adjustments for Reorganization, Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets.
If at any time or from time to time on or after the Original Issue Date, the Common Stock

-8-
$W523398.4
issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or a different
number of shares of any other class or classes of stock, whether by a reorganization, merger or
consolidation of the Company with or into another entity, or the sale of all or substantially all of
the Company’s properties and assets to any other person or entity (other than as provided for
elsewhere in this Section 3 or a transaction subject to Section 2 above) then, as a part of such
reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale, provision shall be made so that the holders of each
series of Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of such series of
Preferred Stock, the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the Company, or
of the successor entity resulting from such merger or consolidation or sale, to which a holder of
Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of each series of Preferred Stock would have been
entitled to receive upon such capital reorganization, merger consolidation or sale. In any such
case, appropriate adjustment shal! be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 3
with respect to the rights and interests of the holders of the then outstanding Preferred Stock after
the reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale to the end that the provisions of this Section 3
(including adjustments of the applicable Conversion Price then in effect for each series of
Preferred Stock and the number of shares purchasable upon conversion of each series of
Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event as nearly equivalent as may be practicable.

(i) Adjustments for Dilutive Issuances.

(i) If at any time or from time to time on or after the Original Issue
Date, the Company shall issue or sell any shares of Common Stock (as actually issued or,
pursuant to paragraph (iii) below, deemed to be issued) for a consideration per share less than the
Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such issue or
sale, then immediately upon such issue or sale the Conversion Price for each such series of
Preferred Stock shall be reduced to a price (calculated to the nearest cent) determined by
multiplying the applicable Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale

by arfractioh, }he numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Calculated Securities (as
heres efined) outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale plus the number of

shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration received by the Company for the
total number of shares of Common Stock so issued or sold (or deemed to be issued or sold)
would purchase at the applicable Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance
or sale, and the dghominator of which shal] be the number of shares of Calculated Securities
outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale plus the number of shares of Common Stock
so issued or sold. “Calculated Securities” means (A) all shares of Common Stock actually
outstanding and (B) all shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise, conversion or exchange
of all Convertible Securities (as hereinafter defined).

(ii) For the purposes of paragraph (i) above, none of the following
issuances (or deemed issuances) shall be considered the issuance (or deemed issuance) or sale of
Common Stock:

(A) The issuance of Common Stock upon the conversion of any
outstanding Convertible Securities as of the date hereof or upon the conversion of the Preferred
Stock, including the issuance of Common Stock as payment for any declared and unpaid

options to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire Convertible Securities or Common Stock
(excluding Convertible Securities and Common Stock issued in accordance with Section 3(i)(ii)
above) (collectively “Options’’) or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders entitled
to receive such Options, whether or not such Options are immediately exercisable, and the price
per share for which Common Stock is issuable upon the exercise of such Options (determined by
dividing (x) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Company as consideration for
the granting of such Options, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration
payable to the Company upon the exercise of such Options, plus, in the case of any such Options
which relate to such Convertible Securities, the minimum aggregate amount of additional
consideration, if any, payable upon the issue or sale of such Convertible Securities and upon the
conversion or exchange thereof, by (y) the total maximum number of shares of Common Stock

-10-
$V\523398.4
issuable upon the exercise of such Options or upon the conversion or exchange of all such
Convertible Securities issuable upon the exercise of such Options as set forth in the instrument
relating thereto assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to the exercisability, convertibility or

Securities as set forth in the instrument relating thereto assuming the satisfaction of any
conditions to the exercisability, convertibility or exchangeability) shall be less than the
Conversion Price in effect for any series of Preferred Stock immediately prior to the time of such
issue or sale, then the total maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
exercise, conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities shall (as of the date of the issue
or sale of such Convertible Securities) be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued for
such price per share, provided that if any such issue or sale of such Convertible Securities is
made upon exercise of any rights to subscribe for or to purchase or any option to purchase any
such Convertible Securities for which adjustments of the conversion price have been or are to be
made pursuant to other provisions of this paragraph (iii), no further adjustment of the conversion
price shall be made by reason of such issue or sale.

(C) Incase at any time any shares of Common Stock, Convertible

to be the fair value of such consideration as determined by the Board of Directors. In case any

$V523398.4
pursuant to the terms of this Section 3(i), are revised (either automatically pursuant to the
provisions contained therein or as a result of an amendment to such terms) to provide for either
(1) any increase or decrease in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the
exercise, conversion or exchange of any such Convertible Security or Option or (2) any increase
or decrease in the consideration payable to the Company upon such exercise, conversion or
exchange, then, effective upon such increase or decrease becoming effective, the Conversion _
Price for such series of Preferred Stock computed upon the original issue of such Convertible
Security or Option (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto) shall be
readjusted to such Conversion Price as would have been obtained had such revised terms been in
effect upon the original date of issuance of such Convertible Security or Option.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment pursuant to this paragraph (D) shall have the effect
of increasing the Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock to an amount which exceeds

adjustment date, or (ii) the Conversion Price for each such series of Preferred Stock that would
have resulted from any issuances of shares of Common Stock without consideration or for a
consideration per share less than the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issue
or sale between the original adjustment date and such readjustment date.

(E) If the original issuance of any Convertible Security or Option
(excluding Convertible Securities or Options which, upon exercise, conversion or exchange
thereof, would entitle the holder thereof to receive securities issued in accordance with Section
3(i)Gi) above), did not result in an adjustment to the Conversion Price for any series of Preferred
Stock pursuant to the terms of Section 3(i), either because (1) the consideration per share
(determined pursuant to Section 3(i)(iii)(C) above) of the Common Stock was equal to or greater
than the Conversion Price then in effect for such series of Preferred Stock, or (2) such
Convertible Security was issued before the date of filing of this Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, are revised after the date of filing of this Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation (either automatically pursuant to the provisions contained therein or
as a result of an amendment to such terms) to provide for either (A) any increase or decrease in
the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of
any such Convertible Security or Option or (B) any increase or decrease in the consideration
payable to the Company upon such exercise, conversion or exchange, then such Convertible
Security or Option, as so amended, and the Common Stock subject thereto (determined in the
manner provided in Subsection 3(i)(iii)(A) and (B) above, as applicable) shall be deemed to have
been issued effective upon such increase or decrease becoming effective.

(j) Certificate of Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment of
the Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 3, the Company at
its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment and furnish to each holder of such series of
Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment and showing in detail the facts upon
which such adjustment is based. The Company shall, as promptly as practicable, upon the
written request at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock, furnish to such holder a like
certificate setting forth (i) any and all adjustments made to the Conversion Price for such series
of Preferred Stock since the date of the first issuance of such series of Preferred Stock, (ii) the
Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock at the time in effect, and (iii) the number of

any time (i) to declare any dividend or distribution; (ii) to effect any reclassification or
recapitalization; or (iii) to effect a Liquidation; then, in connection with each such event, the
Company shall send to the holders of the Preferred Stock written notice at least 20 days prior to
the record date or effective date for such event. The notice shall specify, as the case may be, (i)
the record date for such dividend, distribution: or right, and the amount and character of such
dividend, distribution or right, or (ii) the effective date on which such reclassification,
recapitalization or Liquidation is proposed to take place, and the time, if any is to be fixed, as of
which the holders of record of Common Stock (or such other stock or securities at the time
issuable upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of
Common Stock (or such other stock or securities) for securities or other property deliverable
upon such reclassification, recapitalization or Liquidation, and the amount per share and
character of such exchange applicable to each series of Preferred Stock and the Common Stock.
Any notice required by the provisions hereof to be given to a holder of shares of Preferred Stock
shall be deemed sent to such holder if deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, and
addressed to such holder at such holder’s address appearing on the books of the Company.

() Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Company shall at
all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock,
solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock, such
number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, the Company will take such corporate
action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary (including, without limitation, engaging
in reasonable best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any amendment to this
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation) to increase its authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.
