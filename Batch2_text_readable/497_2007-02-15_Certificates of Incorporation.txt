the property, rights or securities paid or distributed to such holders by the Corporation or the
acquiring person, firm or other entity. If the amount deemed paid or distributed under this
Section C.2(d) is made in property other than in cash, the value of such distribution shall be the

Price, the Series D Conversion Price and the Series E Conversion Price are each sometimes
referred to herein as the “Applicable Conversion Price,” as the context requires.

(b) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued
upon conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which a holder of
Preferred Stock would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shal! pay cash in an amount equal
to such fraction multiplied by the fair market value of a share of Common Stock as determined in
good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. Whether or not fractional shares would
be issuable upon any such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of
shares of Preferred Stock a holder is then converting into Common Stock and the aggregate
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion.

(i) In order for a holder of Preferred Stock to voluntarily convert
shares of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the
certificate or certificates for such shares of Preferred Stock (or, if such holder alleges that such
certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement reasonably
acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made
against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate), at
the office of the transfer agent for the Preferred Stock (or at the principal office of the
Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent), together with written notice that
such holder elects to convert all or any number of the shares of the Preferred Stock represented
by such certificate or certificates and, if applicable, any event on which such conversion is
contingent. Such notice shall state such holder’s name or the names of the nominees in which
such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued. If
required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or
accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the
Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or his, her or its attorney duly authorized in

14
writing. The close of business on the date of receipt by the transfer agent (or by the Corporation
if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent) of such certificates (or lost certificate
affidavit and agreement) and notice shall be the time of conversion (the “Conversion Time”), and
the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the shares represented by such
certificate shall be deemed to be outstanding of record as of such date. The Corporation shall, as
soon as practicable after the Conversion Time, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of
Preferred Stock, or to his, her or its nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of
shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled, together with cash in lieu of any
fraction of a share.

(ii) The Corporation shall at all times when any share of Preferred
Stock is outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued stock, for the
purpose of effecting the conversion of the Preferred Stock, such number of its duly authorized
shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all
outstanding Preferred Stock. If at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of
Common Stock is not sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the
Preferred Stock, the Corporation shal] take such corporate action as may be necessary to increase
its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be
sufficient for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the
requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to this Certificate of Incorporation.
Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment reducing an Applicable Conversion
Price below the then par value of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of
shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series
MI1-A Preferred Stock, Series M1-B Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock or Series E
Preferred Stock, as the case may be, the Corporation will take any corporate action which may,
in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Corporation may validly and legally
issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock at such adjusted Applicable
Conversion Price.

(iii) | All shares of Preferred Stock which shall have been surrendered
for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights with
respect to such shares, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and to vote, shall
immediately cease and terminate at the Conversion Time, except only the right of the holders
thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor and to receive payment of any
dividends declared but unpaid thereon. Any shares of Preferred Stock so converted shal] be
retired and cancelled and shall not be reissued as shares of such series, and the Corporation
(without the need for stockholder action) may from time to time take such appropriate action as
may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Preferred Stock accordingly.

(iv) Upon any such voluntary conversion, no adjustment to the Series
A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price, Series M1-A
Conversion Price, Series M1-B Conversion Price, Series D Conversion Price or Series E
Conversion Price shall be made for any accrued and/or declared but unpaid dividends on any of
the Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion or on the Common Stock delivered upon
conversion; provided, however, that such conversion shall not affect the holder’s right to receive
payment of declared but unpaid dividends.

15
(v) The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and other similar taxes
that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon
conversion of shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section C.4. The Corporation shall not,
however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in
the issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in which the
shares of Preferred Stock so converted were registered, and no such issuance or delivery shal! be
made unless and until the person or entity requesting such issuance has paid to the Corporation
the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax
has been paid or that no such tax is due.

entitle the holder thereof to receive Exempted Securities) or shall fix a record date for the

determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive any such Options or
Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set forth in
the instrument relating thereto, assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to exercisability,
convertibility or exchangeability but without regard to any provision contained therein for a
subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case
of Convertible Securities and Options therefor, the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, shall be deemed to be Additional Shares of Common Stock issued as of the time of
such issue or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such
record date.

issuance of which resulted in an adjustment to an Applicable Conversion Price, are revised
(either automatically pursuant to the provisions contained therein or as a result of an amendment
to such terms) to provide for either (1) any increase or decrease in the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any such Option or
Convertible Security or (2) any increase or decrease in the consideration payable to the
Corporation upon such exercise, conversion or exchange, then, in either case, effective upon
such increase or decrease becoming effective, the Applicable Conversion Price computed upon
the original issue of such Option or Convertible Security (or upon the occurrence of a record date
with respect thereto) shall be readjusted to such Applicable Conversion Price as would have
obtained had such revised terms been in effect upon the original date of issuance of such Option

exceeds the lower of (i) the Applicable Conversion Price on the original adjustment date, or
(ii) the Applicable Conversion Price that would have resulted from any issuances of Additional
Shares of Common Stock between the original adjustment date and such readjustment date.

(excluding Options or Convertible Securities which, upon exercise, conversion or exchange
thereof, would entitle the holder thereof to receive Exempted Securities), the issuance of which
did not result in an adjustment to an Applicable Conversion Price pursuant to the terms of
Section C.4(d)(iv) below (either because the consideration per share of the Additional Shares of
Common Stock subject thereto was equal to or greater than an Applicable Conversion Price then
in effect, or because such Option or Convertible Security was issued before the Series A Original
Issue Date), are revised after the Series E Original Issue Date (either automatically pursuant to
the provisions contained therein or as a result of an amendment to such terms) to provide for
either (1) an increase in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise,
conversion or exchange of any such Option or Convertible Security or (2) a decrease in the
consideration payable to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion or exchange, then such
Option or Convertible Security, as so amended, and the Additional Shares of Common Stock
subject thereto, shall be deemed to have been issued effective upon such increase or decrease
becoming effective for purposes of Section C.4(d){iv) herein.

(iv) Adjustment of Applicable Conversion Price Upon Issuance of
Additional Shares of Common Stock. In the event the Corporation shall (A) at any time after the

Series E Original Issue Date, issue Additional Shares of Common Stock (including Additional
Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to Section C.4(d)¢iii)), without

19
consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Series A Conversion Price, Series B
Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price, Series D Conversion Price and/or Series E
Conversion Price, as applicable, in effect immediately prior to such issuance, then the Series A
Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price, Series D Conversion
Price and/or Series E Conversion Price, as applicable, shall be reduced, concurrently with such

Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to Section C.4(d)(iii)),
without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Series MI-A Conversion
Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance, then the Series M1-A Conversion Price shall
be reduced, concurrently with such issuance, to a price (calculated to the nearest one-hundredth
of a cent) determined in accordance with the following formula:

CP,=CP; * (A+RES+B)+(A+RES+C);

or (C) at any time after the Series M1-B Original Issue Date, issue Additional Shares of
Common Stock (including Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to
Section C.4(d)(iii)), without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Series
M1-B Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance, then the Series M1-B
Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issuance, to a price (calculated to the
nearest one-hundredth of a cent) determined in accordance with the following formula:

CP2=CP, * (A+ RES + B)+(A+RES+C)

Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series MI-A

Common Stock by CP));

(V) “C” shall mean the number of Additional Shares of
Common Stock; and

(VI) “RES” means the number of shares of Common Stock

aggregate amount of cash received by the
Corporation, excluding amounts paid or payable for
accrued interest;

(Il) ‘insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair market value thereof at the
time of such issue, as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors of the Corporation; and

(III) in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock
are issued together with other shares or securities or
other assets of the Corporation for consideration
which covers both, be the proportion of such
consideration so received, computed as provided in

clauses (I) and (II) above, as determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

(B) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per
share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been

21
issued pursuant to Section C.4(d)(iii), relating to Options and Convertible Securities, shall be
determined by dividing:

(1) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by
the Corporation as consideration for the issue of
such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the
minimum aggregate amount of additional
consideration (as set forth in the instruments
relating thereto, without regard to any provision
contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of
such consideration) payable to the Corporation upon
the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the
case of Options for Convertible Securities, the
exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities
and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, by

(IF) = the maximum number of shares of Common Stock
(as set forth in the instruments relating thereto,
without regard to any provision contained therein
for a subsequent adjustment of such number)
issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities. .

(vi) Multiple Closing Dates. In the event the Corporation shall issue on
more than one date Additional Shares of Common Stock that are a part of one transaction or a
series of related transactions and that would result in an adjustment to the Applicable Conversion
Price pursuant to the terms of Section C.4(d)(iv) above, and such issuance dates occur within a
period of no more than 60 days from the first such issuance to the final such issuance, then, upon
the final such issuance, the Applicable Conversion Price shall be readjusted to give effect to all
such issuances as if they occurred on the date of the first such issuance (and without additional
giving effect to any adjustments as a result of any subsequent issuances within such period).

(e) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If the Corporation shall at
any time or from time to time after the Series E Original Issue Date effect a subdivision of the

outstanding Common Stock without a comparable subdivision of the Series A Preferred Stock,
Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series M1-A Preferred Stock, Series M1-B
Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock and/or Series E Preferred Stock, or combine the
outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred
Stock, Series M1-A Preferred Stock, Series M1-B Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock
and/or Series E Preferred Stock without a comparable combination of the Common Stock, then
each Applicable Conversion Price (with respect to each such security for which no comparable
change is made) in effect immediately before that subdivision or combination shall be
proportionately decreased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion
of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series

22
MI-A Preferred Stock, Series M1-B Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock and/or Series E
Preferred Stock, as applicable, shall be increased in proportion to such increase in the aggregate
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding or to such decrease in the number of
outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred
Stock, Series M1-A Preferred Stock, Series M1-B Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock
and/or Series E Preferred Stock, as applicable. If the Corporation shall at any time or from time
to time after the Series E Original Issue Date combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock
without a comparable combination of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock,
Series C Preferred Stock, Series MI-A Preferred Stock, Series M1-B Preferred Stock, Series D
Preferred Stock and/or Series E Preferred Stock or effect a subdivision of the outstanding shares
of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series M1-A
Preferred Stock, Series M1-B Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock and/or Series E
Preferred Stock without a comparable subdivision of the Common Stock, then the Applicable
Conversion Price (with respect to each such security for which no comparable change is made)
in effect immediately before the combination or subdivision shall be proportionately increased so
that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of shares of Series A
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series MI-A Preferred
Stock, Series M1-B Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock and/or Series E Preferred Stock, as
applicable, shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in the aggregate number of shares
of Common Stock outstanding or increase in the number of outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series MI-A Preferred
Stock, Series M1-B Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock and/or Series E Preferred Stock, as
applicable. Any adjustment under this subsection shall become effective at the close of business
on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective.

(f Adjustment for Certain Dividends and Distributions. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Series E Original Issue Date shall make or

issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive,
a dividend or other distribution payable on the Common Stock in additional shares of Common
Stock, then and in each such case the Applicable Conversion Price in effect immediately before
such event shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance or, in the event such a record date
shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, by multiplying each
Applicable Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction:

(1) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of
business on such record date, and

(2) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of
business on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of
such dividend or distribution;

provided, however, that if such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend is not fully
paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, then cach Applicable
Conversion Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record date
and thereafter each Applicable Conversion Price shal] be adjusted pursuant to this subsection as

23

of the time of actual payment of such dividends or distributions; and provided further, however,
that no such adjustment shall be made to the Applicable Conversion Price with respect to a series
of Preferred Stock if the holders of shares of that series of Preferred Stock simultaneously
receive (i) a dividend or other distribution of shares of Common Stock in a number equa! to what
they would have received with respect to shares of Common Stock if all outstanding shares of
that series of Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event
or (ii) a dividend or other distribution of shares of Preferred Stock which are convertible, as of
the date of such event, into such number of shares of Common Stock as is equal to the number of
additional shares of Common Stock being issued with respect to each share of Common Stock in
such dividend or distribution.

(g) Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Series E Original Issue Date shall make or

issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of capital stock of the Corporation
entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the Corporation (other
than a distribution of shares of Common Stock in respect of outstanding shares of Common
Stock) or in other property and the provisions of Section C.4(f) do not apply to such dividend or
distribution, then and in each such event the holders of shares of Preferred Stock then issued and
outstanding shall receive, simultaneously with the distribution to the holders of such capital
stock, a dividend or other distribution of such securities or other property in an amount equal to
the amount of such securities or other property as they would have received with respect to
shares of Common Stock if all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock had been converted into
Common Stock on the date of such event.

(h) Adjustment for Merger or Reorganization, etc. Subject to the provisions
of Section C.2(d), if there shall occur any reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,

consolidation or merger involving the Corporation in which the. Common Stock (but not the
Preferred Stock) is converted into or exchanged for securities, cash or other property (other than
a transaction covered by Sections C.4(e), (f) or (g)), then, following any such reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger, each outstanding share of Series A
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series M1-A Preferred
Stock, Series M1-B Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock and Series E Preferred Stock shall
thereafter be convertible, in lieu of the respective number of shares of Common Stock into which
each of those shares was convertible prior to such event, into the kind and amount of securities,
cash or other property which a holder of the respective number of shares of Common Stock of
the Corporation issuable upon conversion of each of those shares immediately prior to such
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger would have been
entitled to receive pursuant to such transaction; and, in such case, appropriate adjustment (as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation) shall be made in the
application of the provisions in this Section C.4 with respect to the rights and interests thereafter
of the holders of any Preferred Stock, to the end that the provisions set forth in this Section C.4
(including provisions with respect to changes in and other adjustments of the Applicable
Conversion Prices) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as possible, in relation to any
securities or other property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of any Preferred Stock.

(i) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment to any Applicable Conversion Price pursuant to this Section C.4, the Corporation at

24
its expense shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable but in any event not later than 10 days
thereafter, compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and
furnish to each holder of any affected series of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such
adjustment or readjustment (including the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property
into which the affected series of Preferred Stock is convertible) and showing in detail the facts
upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the written request at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock (but
in any event not later than 10 days thereafter), furnish to such holder a certificate setting forth
(i) the Applicable Conversion Price then in effect with respect to the series of Preferred Stock
that is the subject of the request, and (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount,
if any, of other securities, cash or property which then would be received upon the conversion of
that series of Preferred Stock.

(j) Notice of Record Date. In the event:

(i) the Corporation shall take a record of the holders of its Common
Stock (or other stock or securities at the time issuable upon conversion of any of the Preferred
Stock) for the purpose of entitling or enabling them to receive any dividend or other distribution,
or to receive any right to subscribe for or purchase any shares of stock of any class or any other
securities, or to receive any other right; or

(ji) of any capital reorganization of the Corporation, any
reclassification of the Common Stock of the Corporation, or any Deemed Liquidation Event; or

(iii) | of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-
up of the Corporation,

then, and in each such case, the Corporation shall send to all holders of Preferred Stock a notice
specifying. as the case may be, (i) the record date for such dividend, distribution or right, and the
amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right, or (ii) the effective date on which
such reorganization, reclassification, Deemed Liquidation Event, dissolution, liquidation or
winding-up is proposed to take place, and the time, if any is to be fixed, as of which the holders
of record of Common Stock (or such other stock or securities at the time issuable upon the
conversion of any of the Preferred Stock) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common
Stock (or such other stock or securities) for securities or other property deliverable upon such
reorganization, reclassification, Deemed Liquidation Event, dissolution, liquidation or winding-
up, and the amount per share and character of such exchange applicable to each series of the
Preferred Stock and the Common Stock. Such notice shall be sent at least 20 days prior to the
record date or effective date for the event specified in such notice. Any notice required by the
provisions hereof to be given to a holder Preferred Stock shall be deemed sent to such holder if
deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to such holder at his, her or
its address appearing on the books of the Corporation.

(k) Special Adjustments to Series E Conversion Price.

(i) In the event the Corporation, at any time after the Series E Original
Issue Date but on or before December 31, 2007 (the “Series E Outside Date”), shall issue or be

25
deemed pursuant to Section C.4(d)(iii) to issue Additional Shares of Common Stock for an
aggregate consideration in excess of $2,500,000 and for consideration per share (determined in
accordance with C.4(d)(v)) less than the then-applicable Series E Conversion Price (the “Series E
Special Adjustment Trigger”), then the Series E Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently
with such issuance, to the price equal to the consideration per share (determined as described
above) received by the Corporation for such issuance or deemed issuance of Additional Shares of
Common Stock (the “Series E Special Adjustment Price”); provided, that if the Corporation
completes a Bona Fide Equity Round (as defined below) for consideration per share at least
equal to the then-applicable Series E Conversion Price, this Section C.4(k) shall terminate and no
adjustment shall be made to the Series E Conversion Price pursuant to this Section C.4(k);
provided further, that if the Corporation completes a Bona Fide Equity Round for a price per
share below the then-applicable Series E Conversion Price, this Section C.4{k) shall apply to
such issuance but this Section C.4(k) shall thereafter terminate and no further adjustment shall be
made to the Series E Conversion Price pursuant to this Section C.4(k). For purposes of this
Section, a “Bona Fide Equity Round” shall be any issuance by the Corporation of Common
Stock, Convertible Securities or Options for cash (x) involving the issuance or deemed issuance
of Additional Shares of Common Stock in an aggregate amount equal to at least $50 million in
which the percentage of funding from any party purchasing such securities who is not, prior to
the issuance of such Common Stock, Convertible Securities or Options, a stockholder of the
Corporation (or an affiliate of such stockholder) is at least equa! to the percentage calculated by
dividing (A) the aggregate number of shares of Series E Preferred Stock issued to any person that
is not then a stockholder of the Corporation (or an affiliate of such stockholder) prior to the
Initial Closing (as defined in the Series E Purchase Agreement) in connection with the Initial
Closing and any Additional Closings (as defined in the Series E Purchase Agreement), by (B) the
aggregate number of shares of Series E Preferred Stock issued in connection with the Initial
Closing and any Additional Closings and (y) the proceeds of which are used to fund operating
expenses and capital expenditures, to pay transaction expenses and for other general corporate
purposes and are not used, directly or indirectly, to repurchase or redeem any of the Company’s
capital stock or for acquisitions. In calculating the amount, if any, by which the Series E
Conversion Price is reduced hereunder, there shall be taken into account any Additional Shares
of Common Stock issued or deemed to be issued that are sold on substantially similar terms (not
including price) to substantially similar investors in connection with a single plan of financing or
a series of related financings. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a “Bona Fide Equity Round” shall
not include any issuance or deemed issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock pursuant to
the Series E Purchase Agreement.

(ii) If an adjustment to the Series E Conversion Price is made under
this Section C.4(k) in the manner described above, then any prior adjustments that have been
made to the Series E Conversion Price, as applicable, shall be re-calculated in sequential order
after having given effect to the adjustment made pursuant to this Section C.4(k).

5. Automatic Conversion.

(a) Upon (i) the closing of the sale of shares of Common Stock to the public

and the like) equal to at least three (3) times the Series E Issue Price in a firm commitment
underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities

26
Act of 1933, as amended, resulting in at least $125,000,000 of gross proceeds to the Corporation
(a “Qualified Public Offering”) or (ii) the written consent or affirmative vote of (x) a Series
A/B/C/D/E Majority, (y) so long as the outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock represent
at least 15% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock (calculated on a fully-
diluted, as converted basis), a Series D Majority and (z) a Series E Majority (provided, however,
that if at any time that there have been at least 181,357 shares of Series M1-A Preferred Stock
and 725,530 shares of Series M1-B Preferred Stock outstanding (such numbers of shares to be
appropriately adjusted in the event of any stock split or stock dividend that changes the number
of outstanding shares of Series M1-A Preferred Stock or Series MI-B Preferred Stock, as
applicable), then the written consent or affirmative vote required under clause (x) above of this
subsection 5(a) shal! be that of a Preferred Majority) (the date of that closing or consent or vote,
the “Mandatory Conversion Date”), (1) all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall
automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at their respective Applicable
Conversion Prices in effect as of the date of the Mandatory Conversion Date and (IDI none of
such shares of Preferred Stock may be reissued by the Corporation as shares of any such series of
Preferred Stock.

(b) All holders of record of shares of Preferred Stock shall be given written
notice of the Mandatory Conversion Date and the place designated for mandatory conversion of
all such shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section C.5. Such notice need not be given in
advance of the occurrence of the Mandatory Conversion Date. Such notice shall be sent by first
class or registered mail, postage prepaid, or given by electronic communication in compliance
with the provisions of the General Corporation Law, to each record holder of Preferred Stock.
Upon receipt of such notice, each holder of shares of Preferred Stock shall surrender his, her or
its certificate or certificates for all such shares to the Corporation at the place designated in such
notice, and shall thereafter receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Section C.5. On the Mandatory Conversion Date,
all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have been converted into shares of
Common Stock, which shall be deemed to be outstanding of record, and all rights with respect to
the Preferred Stock so converted, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and vote (other
than as a holder of Common Stock), will terminate, except only the rights of the holders thereof,
upon surrender of their certificate or certificates therefor, to receive certificates for the number of
shares of Common Stock into which such Preferred Stock has been converted, and payment of
any declared but unpaid dividends thereon. If so required by the Corporation, certificates
surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by written instrument or
instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered
holder or by his, her or its attorney duly authorized in writing. As soon as practicable after the
Mandatory Conversion Date and the surrender of the certificate or certificates for Preferred
Stock, the Corporation shall cause to be issued and delivered to each holder thereof, or on his,
her or its written order, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common
Stock issuable on such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof and cash as provided
in Section C.4(b) in respect of any fraction of a share of Common Stock that would otherwise
have been issuable upon such conversion.

(c) Intentionally Omitted.

(d) Special Mandatory Conversion -- Qualified Financings.
27
(i) In the event that any holder of then outstanding Preferred Stock
does not participate in a Qualified Financing (as defined below) by purchasing in the aggregate,

that the Corporation has given such holder at least ten (10) business days written notice of the
Qualified Financing), such holder’s Pro Rata Amount (as defined below) for cash or other
consideration set forth in the purchase agreement relating thereto (provided, that pursuant to and
in all respects subject to Section ].02(c) of the MT'VN Purchase Agreement, MTVN shall, under
the circumstances set forth in Section 1.02(c) of the MITVN Purchase Agreement, have, with
respect to any such Qualified Financing and on or before the closing date of such Qualified
Financing, the right to participate in such Qualified Financing by purchasing the securities issued
thereunder by having contributed media advertising placement services pursuant to the License
Agreement (as defined in the MTVN Purchase Agreement)), then that number of Non-
Participating Shares (as defined below) of Preferred Stock held by such holder shall
automatically, on a pro rata basis and without any further action on the part of such holder, be
converted into shares of Common Stock at the Applicable Conversion Price with respect to such
shares of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to the consummation of such Qualified
Financing, effective upon the consummation of the Qualified Financing (a “Special Mandatory
Conversion”). For purposes of determining the number of shares of Preferred Stock owned by
any holder of Preferred Stock, and for determining the number of Offered Securities (as defined
below) that such holder has purchased in a Qualified Financing, all shares of Preferred Stock
held by Affiliates of such holder shall be aggregated with such holder’s shares, and all Offered
Securities purchased by Affiliates of such holder shall be aggregated with the Offered Securities
purchased by such holder (provided, that no shares or securities shall be attributed to more than
one Person within any such group of affiliated entities or persons). Upon such Special
Mandatory Conversion, any shares of Preferred Stock so converted shall be cancelled and not

subject to reissuance.

(ii) | Upon a Special Mandatory Conversion, each holder of shares of
Preferred Stock converted pursuant to Section C.5(d)(i) shall surrender its certificate or
certificates for all such shares to the Corporation at the place designated in such notice, and shall
thereafter receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section C.5(d)(i). Al! rights with respect to the Preferred Stock converted
pursuant to Section C.5(d){i), including the rights, if any, to receive notices and vote (other than
as a holder of Common Stock), will terminate, except only the rights of the holder thereof, upon
surrender of its certificate or certificates therefor, to receive certificates for the number of shares
of Common Stock into which such Preferred Stock has been converted, and payment of any
declared but unpaid dividends thereon. If so required by the Corporation, certificates
surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by written instrument or
instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered
holder or by its attorney duly authorized in writing. As soon as practicable after the Special
Mandatory Conversion pursuant hereto and the surrender of the certificate or certificates for
Preferred Stock so converted, the Corporation shall cause to be issued and delivered to such
holder. or on its written order, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of
Common Stock issuable on such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof, and cash
as provided in Section C.4(b) in respect of any fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise
issuable upon such conversion.

28
(iii) | ATl certificates evidencing shares of Preferred Stock which are
required to be surrendered for conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof shall, from
and after the time of the Special Mandatory Conversion, be deemed to have been retired and
cancelled, and the shares of Preferred Stock converted pursuant to Section C.5(d)(i) represented
thereby shall, from and after the time of the Special Mandatory Conversion, be deemed to have
been converted into Common Stock for all purposes, notwithstanding the failure of the holder
thereof to surrender such certificates on or prior to such date. The Corporation may thereafter
take such appropriate action (without the need for stockholder action) as may be necessary to
reduce the authorized number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock,
Series C Preferred Stock, Series MI-A Preferred Stock, Series M1-B Preferred Stock, Series D
Preferred Stock and/or Series E Preferred Stock, as applicable.

to any Option or Convertible Securities then held by such holder), and the denominator of which
is equal to the total number of shares of Common Stock then issued and outstanding (calculated
