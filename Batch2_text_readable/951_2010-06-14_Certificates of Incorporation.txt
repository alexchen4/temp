Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series A-2 Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Common Stock
by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount per share equal to the sum of (A) the Series C
Preference for each outstanding share of Series C Preferred Stock and (B) an amount equal! to all
declared but unpaid dividends on such share (subject to adjustment for Recapitalizations). If upon
the occurrence of such event, the assets and funds thus distributed among the holders of the Series C
Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full aforesaid
preferential amounts, then the entire assets and funds of this Corporation legally available for

pa-1391785
distribution to stockholders shall be distributed ratably among the holders of the Series C Preferred
Stock in proportion to the full preferential amount each such holder is otherwise entitled to receive
under this ARTICLE V, Section 3(a).

(b) Upon completion of the distribution of the full amount required by ARTICLE
V, Section 3(a), the holders of Series A-1] Preferred Stock, Series A-2 Preferred Stock and Series B
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, on a pari passu basis, prior and in preference to any
distribution of any of the assets of this Corporation to the holders of Common Stock by reason of
their ownership thereof, (1) for the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, an amount per share equal to the sum
of (A) the Series A-1 Preference for each outstanding share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock and (B) an
amount equal to all declared but unpaid dividends on such share (subject to adjustment for
Recapitalizations); (1i) for the Series A-2 Preferred Stock, an amount per share equal to the sum of

(A) the Series B Preference for each outstanding share of Series B Preferred Stock and (B) an

the holders of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series A-2 Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred
Stock shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full aforesaid preferential
amounts, then the entire assets and funds of this Corporation legally available for distribution
pursuant to this ARTICLE V, Section 3(b) shall be distributed ratably among the holders of the
Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series A-2 Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock in proportion to
the full preferential amount each such holder is otherwise entitled to receive under this ARTICLE V,
Section 3(b).

(c) Upon completion of the distributions of the full amount required by
ARTICLE V, Section 3(a) and ARTICLE V, Section 3(b), all of the remaining assets of this
Corporation legally available for distribution to stockholders shall be distributed among the holders
of Series C Preferred Stock and Common Stock pro rata based on the number of shares of Common
Stock held by each (treating the shares of Series C Preferred Stock for this purpose as if they had
been converted to shares of Common Stock at the then-effective Conversion Price for such shares);
provided, however, that the holders of Series C Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to further
participate in any distribution of the remaining assets of the Corporation pursuant to this ARTICLE
V, Section 3(c) following the receipt by such holders of aggregate distributions per share of Series C
Preferred Stock pursuant to this ARTICLE V, Section 3 equal to $2.7330, including amounts
received pursuant to ARTICLE V, Section 3(a).

(d) Shares not Treated _as Both Preferred Stock and Common Stock in any
Distribution; Deemed Conversion.

(i) Shares of Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to be converted into
shares of Common Stock in order to participate in any Distribution, or series of Distributions, as
shares of Common Stock without first foregoing participation in the Distribution, or series of
Distributions, as shares of Preferred Stock.

pa-1391785
(ii) | Notwithstanding Sections 3(a), 3(b) and 3(c) above, for purposes of
determining the amount each holder of shares of Preferred Stock is entitled to receive with respect to
a Liquidation Event (as defined below), the holder of each share of a series of Preferred Stock shall
be treated as if such holder had converted such holder’s shares of such series into shares of Common
Stock immediately prior to the Liquidation Event if, as a result of an actual conversion of such series
(including taking into account the operation of this Section 3(d) with respect to all series of Preterred
Stock), each holder of such series would receive (with respect to the shares of such series), in the
ageregate (at the closing of the Liquidation Event and at each date afier the closing on which
additional amounts, such as earnout payments, escrow amounts and other contingent payments, are
paid to the stockholders), an amount greater than the amount that would be distributed to holders of
such series (with respect to the shares of such series) if such holders had not converted such series
into shares of Common Stock. If holders of any series of Preferred Stock are treated as if they had
converted shares of Preferred Stock into Common Stock pursuant to this Section 3(d), then such
holders shall not be entitled to receive any Distribution pursuant to Section 3(a) or 3(b) that would
otherwise be made to holders of such series of Preferred Stock.

(e) Reorganization. For purposes of this Section 3, a liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation (each, a “Liquidation Event”) shal! be deemed to be occasioned by,
or to include, (a) the acquisition of the Corporation by another entity by means of any transaction or
series of related transactions to which the Corporation is party (including, without limitation, any
stock acquisition, reorganization, merger or consolidation but excluding any sale of stock for capital
raising purposes) other than a transaction or series of transactions in which the holders of the voting
securities of the Corporation outstanding immediately prior to such transaction continue to retain
(either by such voting securities remaining outstanding or by such voting securities being converted
into voting securities of the surviving entity), as a result of shares in the Corporation held by such
holders prior to such transaction, at least fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power represented by
the voting securities of the Corporation or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such
transaction or series of transactions; (b) a sale, lease or other conveyance of all or substantially all of
the assets of the Corporation; or (c) any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation,
whether voluntary or involuntary; provided, however, that in each case the rights in this Section 3
may be waived by a vote of at least sixty-six and two thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the Preferred Stock
then outstanding and at least 75% of the Series C Preferred Stock then outstanding.

(f) Valuation of Non-Cash Consideration. If any assets of the Corporation
distributed to stockholders in connection with any Liquidation Event are other than cash, then the
value of such assets shall be their fair market value as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors, except that any publicly-traded securities to be distributed to stockholders in a liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation shall be valued as follows:

(i) if the securities are then traded on a national securities exchange (ora
national! quotation system), then the value of the securities shall be deemed to be the average of the
closing prices of the securities on such exchange or system over the ten (10) trading day period
ending three (3) trading days prior to the Distribution; or

(ii) if the securities are actively traded over-the-counter, then the valuc of
the securities shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid prices of the securities over the ten
(10) trading day period ending three (3) trading days prior to the Distribution.

pa-1391785
In the event of a merger or other acquisition of the Corporation by another entity, the
Distribution date shall be deemed to be the date such transaction closes.

For the purposes of this subsection 3(f), “trading day” shall mean any day which the
exchange or system on which the securities to be distributed are traded is open and “closing prices”
or “closing bid prices” shall be deemed to be: (i) for securities traded primarily on the New York
Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, the last reported trade price or sale price,
as the case may be, at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on that day and (ii) for securities listed or traded on
other exchanges, markets and systems, the market price as of the end of the regular hours trading
period that is generally accepted as such for such exchange, market or system. If, after the date
hereof, the benchmark times generally accepted in the securities industry for determining the market
price of a stock as of a given trading day shall change from those set forth above, the fair market
value shall be determined as of such other generally accepted benchmark times.

4. Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as
follows:

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the
option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share at the office of the
Corporation or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, into that number of fully-paid,
nonassessable shares of Common Stock determined by dividing the Original Issue Price for the
relevant series by the Conversion Price for such series. The number of shares of Common Stock into
which each share of Preferred Stock of a series may be converted is hereinafter referred to as the
“Conversion Rate” for each such series. Upon any decrease or increase in the Conversion Price for
any series of Preferred Stock, as described in this Section 4, the Conversion Rate for such series shal]
be appropriately increased or decreased.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be
converted into fully-paid, non-assessable shares of Common Stock at the then effective Conversion
Rate for such share (i) immediately prior to the closing of a firm commitment underwritten initial
public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the “Securities Act”), covering the offer and sale of the Corporation’s Common Stock,
provided that the offering price per share is not Jess than $2.2775 (as adjusted for Recapitalizations)
and the aggregate gross proceeds to the Corporation are not less than $30,000,000 before deduction
of underwriters commissions and expenses, or (ii) upon the receipt by the Corporation of a written
request for such conversion from the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of
the Preferred Stock then outstanding, or, if later, the effective date for conversion specified in such
request; provided, however, that shares of Preferred Stock shall not be automatically converted into
shares of Common Stock without the consent of holders of at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the
Series C Preferred Stock in connection with a Liquidation Event in which the holders of the Series C
Preferred Stock would not receive an amount per share equal to or greater than the amount each such
holder is otherwise entitled to receive under ARTICLE V, Section 3. Each of the events referred to
in (1) and (ii) are referred to herein as an “Automatic Conversion Event.”

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be
issued upon conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder
would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the

pa-1391785
then fair market value of a share of Common Stock as determined by the Board of Directors. For
such purpose, all shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder of Preferred Stock shall be
aggregated, and any resulting fractional share of Common Stock shall be paid in cash. Before any
holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into full shares of Common Stock, and
to receive certificates therefor, he shall either (A) surrender the certificate or certificates therefor,
duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock or
(B) notify the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or
destroyed and execute an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation
from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates, and shall give written notice to the
Corporation at such office that he elects to convert the same; provided, however, that on the date of
an Automatic Conversion Event, the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted
automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the
certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent;
provided, further, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such Automatic Conversion Event unless either the
certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are delivered to the Corporation or its transfer
agent as provided above, or the holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such
certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the
Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such
certificates. On the date of the occurrence of an Automatic Conversion Event, each holder of record
of shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion, notwithstanding that the certificates representing such shares of
Preferred Stock shall not have been surrendered at the office of the Corporation, that notice from the
Corporation shal] not have been received by any holder of record of shares of Preferred Stock or that
the certificates evidencing such shares of Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered to such
holder.

The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after such delivery, or after such agreement and
indemnification, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which he shall be entitled as aforesaid and
a check payable to the holder in the amount of any cash amounts payable as the result of a
conversion into fractional shares of Common Stock, plus any declared and unpaid dividends on the
converted Preferred Stock. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior
to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be
converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon
such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of
Common Stock on such date; provided, however, that if the conversion is in connection with an
underwritten offer of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act or a merger, sale, financing,
or liquidation of the Corporation or other event, the conversion may, at the option of any holder
tendering Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing of such transaction or
upon the occurrence of such event, in which case the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion of the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such
Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such transaction or the occurrence of such
event.

(d) Adjustments to Conversion Price for Diluting Issues.

pa-1391785
(i) Special Definition. For purposes of this Section 4(d), “Additional

party service providers in connection with the provision of goods or services pursuant to transactions

pa-1391785
approved by the Board of Directors, including the affirmative vote of a majority of the Preferred
Stock Directors.

(ii) | NoAdjustment of Conversion Price. No adjustment in the Conversion
Price of a particular series of Preferred Stock shal! be made in respect of the issuance of Additional
Shares of Common unless the consideration per share (as determined pursuant to Section 4(d)(v)) for
an Additional Share of Common issued or deemed to be issued by the Corporation is less than the
Conversion Price in effect on the date of, and immediately prior, to such issue for such series of
Preterred Stock.

(iii) | Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the date of the filing of this Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall issue any Options or Convertible Securities or shall fix a
record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive any such
Options or Convertible Securities, the maximum number of shares (as set forth in the instrument
relating thereto without regard to any provisions contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of
such number) of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case of
Convertible Securities, the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities or, in the case of
Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options and the conversion or exchange of
the underlying securities, shall be deemed to have been issued as of the time of such issue or, in case
such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, provided
that in any such case in which shares are deemed to be issued:

(1) no further adjustment in the Conversion Price of any series of
Preferred Stock shall be made upon the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities or shares of
Common Stock in connection with the exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities;

(2) if such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms
provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any change in the consideration payable to the
Corporation or in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or
exchange thereof (other than a change pursuant to the anti-dilution provisions of such Options or
Convertible Securities such as this Section 4(d) or pursuant to Recapitalization provisions of such
Options or Convertible Securities such as Sections 4(e), 4(f) and 4(g) hereof), the Conversion Price
of each series of Preferred Stock and any subsequent adjustments based thereon shall be recomputed
to reflect such change as if such change had been in effect as of the original issue thereof (or upon
the occurrence of the record date with respect thereto);

(3) no readjustment pursuant to clause (2) above shall have the
effect of increasing the Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock to an amount above the
Conversion Price that would have resulted from any other issuances of Additional Shares of
Common and any other adjustments provided for herein between the original adjustment date and
such readjustment date;

(4) upon the expiration of any such Options or any rights of

conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have been exercised, the
Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon

pa-1391785
the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto) and any subsequent adjustments based thereon
shall, upon such expiration, be recomputed as if

(a) in the case of Convertible Securities or Options for
Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common issued were the shares of Common Stock, if
any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities and the consideration received therefor was the consideration actually
received by the Corporation for the issue of such exercised Options plus the consideration actually
received by the Corporation upon such exercise or for the issue of all such Convertible Securities
which were actually converted or exchanged, plus the additional consideration, if any, actually
received by the Corporation upon such conversion or exchange, and

(b) in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, only
the Convertible Securities, ifany, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were issued at the time of
issue of such Options, and the consideration received by the Corporation for the Additional Shares of
Common deemed to have been then issued was the consideration actually received by the
Corporation for the issue of such exercised Options, plus the consideration deemed to have been
received by the Corporation (determined pursuant to Section 4(d)(v)) upon the issue of the
Convertible Securities with respect to which such Options were actually exercised: and

(5) if such record date shall have been fixed and such Options or
Convertible Securities are not issued on the date fixed therefor, the adjustment previously made in
the Conversion Price which became effective on such record date shall be canceled as of the close of
business on such record date, and thereafter the Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this
Section 4(d)(iii) as of the actual date of their issuance.

(iv) Adjustment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional Shares
of Common. In the event this Corporation shall issue Additional Shares of Common (including

Additional Shares of Common deemed to be issued pursuant to Section 4(d)(iii)) without
consideration or for a consideration per share less than the applicable Conversion Price ofa series of
Preferred Stock in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such issue, the Conversion Price of
the affected series of Preferred Stock shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price
(calculated to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the
numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior
to such issue plus the number of shares which the aggregate consideration received by the
Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of Common so issued would purchase at such
Conversion Price, and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of such Additional Shares of Common
so issued. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Conversion Price shall not be reduced at such time if
the amount of such reduction would be less than $0.01, but any such amount shall be carried
forward, and a reduction will be made with respect to such amount at the time of, and together with,
any subsequent reduction which, together with such amount and any other amounts so carried
forward, equal $0.01 or more in the aggregate. For the purposes of this Section 4(d)(iv), all shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock and the
exercise and/or conversion of any other outstanding Convertible Securities and all outstanding
Options shal! be deemed to be outstanding. All securities deemed to be outstanding in the preceding

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this Section 4(d), the
consideration received by the Corporation for the issue (or deemed issue) of any Additional Shares
of Common shall be computed as follows:

(1) Cash and Property. Such consideration shall:

(a) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
aggregate amount of cash received by the Corporation before deducting any reasonable discounts,
commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the Corporation for any underwriting or
otherwise in connection with such issuance;

(b) insofar as it in whole or in part consists of property
other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be computed at the fair market value thereof
at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors; and

(c) in the event Additional Shares of Common are issued
together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for consideration which
covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in clauses (a)
and (b) above, as reasonably determined in good faith by the Board of Directors to apply to the
Additional Shares of Common so issued.

(2) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per
share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common deemed to have been issued

pursuant to paragraph 4(d)(iii) shall be determined by dividing

(x) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Corporation as
consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the minimum aggregate
amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to
any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration) payable to the
Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options for
Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities by

(y) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set forth in the
instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent
adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities.

event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided (by stock split, by payment of a
stock dividend or otherwise) into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion
Price of each series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall,
concurrently with the effectiveness of such subdivision, be proportionately decreased. In the event
the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined (by reclassification or otherwise) into a
lesser number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock in

11
pa-1391785
effect immediately prior to such combination shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such
combination, be proportionately increased.

(f) Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of Preferred Stock. In the
event the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock or a series of Preferred Stock shall be subdivided (by

stock split, by payment of a stock dividend or otherwise) into a greater number of shares of Preferred
Stock, the Conversion Price of the affected series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately before
such subdivision shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such subdivision, be proportionately
increased, and the Dividend Rate and Liquidation Preference of the affected series of Preferred Stock
in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such
subdivision, be proportionately decreased. In the event the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock or
a series of Preferred Stock shall be combined (by reclassification or otherwise) into a lesser number
of shares of Preferred Stock, the Conversion Price of the affected series of Preferred Stock in effect
immediately before such combination shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination,
be proportionately decreased, and the Dividend Rate and Liquidation Preference of the affected
series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such combination shall, concurrently with the
effectiveness of such combination, be proportionately increased.

(x) Adjustments for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. Subject to
Section 3 above, if the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be

changed into the same or a different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock, whether
by capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of
shares provided for above), then, in any such event, in lieu of the number of shares of Common
Stock which the holders would otherwise have been entitled to receive each holder of such Preferred
Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such shares of Preferred Stock into a number of
shares of such other class or classes of stock which a holder of the number of shares of Common
Stock deliverable upon conversion of such series of Preferred Stock immediately before that change
would have been entitled to receive in such reorganization or reclassification, all subject to further
adjustment as provided herein with respect to such other shares.

(h) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation at its expense shall
promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish
to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and

furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and readjustments, (11) the

amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon the conversion of
Preferred Stock.

to the contrary, any downward adjustment of the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock
may be waived either prospectively or retroactively and either generally or ina particular instance by
the consent or vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the
outstanding shares of such series (or 75%, in the case of the Series C Preferred Stock), either before

12
pa- 1391785
or after the issuance causing the adjustment. Any such waiver shall bind all future holders of shares
of such series of Preferred Stock.

(j) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at all
times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock, solely

for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock, such number of its
shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then
outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding
shares of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion
of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such
number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.
