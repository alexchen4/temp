A52942.7 8

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at
the option of the holder thereof, at any time and from time to time, and without the payment of
additional consideration by the holder thereof, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable
shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing $1.00 by the Series A Conversion Price

applicable to such share, determined as hereafter provided, in effect at the time of conversion. .

The “Series A Conversion Price” shall initially be equal to the Series A Original Issue Price.
Such initial Series A Conversion Price, and the rate at which shares of Series A Preferred Stock
may be converted into shares of Common stock, shall be subject to adjustment as provided
below.

In the event of a notice of redemption of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant
to Section B.6 hereof, the Conversion Rights of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock related to
the shares designated for redemption shall terminate at the close of business on the last full day
preceding the date fixed for redemption, unless the redemption price is not paid on such
redemption date, in which case the Conversion Rights for such shares shall continue until such
price is paid in full. In the event of a Liquidation Event or 2 Deemed Liquidation Event, the
Conversion Rights shall terminate at the close of business on the last full day preceding the date
fixed for the payment of any such amounts distributable on such event to the holders of Series A
Preferred Stock.

(b) Fractional Shares, No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued
upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the
holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction
multiplied by the then effective Series A Conversion Price.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion.

(a) In order for a holder of Series A Preferred Stock to voluntarily
convert shares of Series A Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall!
surrender the certificate or certificates for such shares of Preferred Stock (or, if such registered
holder alleges that such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit
and agreement reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against
any Claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or
destruction of such certificate), at the office of the transfer agent for the Series A Preferred Stock
(or at the principal office of the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent),
together with written notice that such holder elects to convert all or any number of the shares of
the Series A Preferred Stock represented by such certificate or certificates and, if applicable, any
event on which such conversion is contingent. Such notice shall state such holder's name or the
names of the nominees in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of
Common Stock to be issued. If required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered tor
conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer,
in form reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or his,
her or its attorney duly authorized in writing. The close of business on the date of receipt by the
transfer agent of such certificates (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement) and notice (or by

A52942.7 9

the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent) shall be the time of
conversion (the “Conversion Time”), and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of the shares represented by such certificate shall be deemed to be outstanding of
record as of such date. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after the Conversion Time,
issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Series A Preferred Stock, or to his, her or its
nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such
holder shall be entitled, together with cash in lieu of any fraction of a share.

(ii) The Corporation shali at all times when the Series A Preferred
Stock shall be outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued
Common Stock, for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, such
number of its duly authorized shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be suffictent to
effect the conversion of all outstanding Series A Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number
of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall
take such corporate action as may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of
Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including,
without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any
necessary amendment to this Certificate of Incorporation. Before taking any action which would
cause an adjustment reducing the Series A Conversion Price below the then par value of the
shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, the
Corporation will take any corporate action which may, in the reasonable opinion of its counsel,
be necessary in order that the Corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock ut such adjusted Series A Conversion Price.

(iii) All shares of Sertes A Preferred Stock which shall have been
surrendered for conversion as herein provided shal] no longer be deemed to be outstanding and
all rights with respect to such shares, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and to vote,
shall immediately cease and terminate at the Conversion Time, except only the right of the
holders thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor and to receive payment
of any dividends declared but unpaid thereon. Any shares of Series A Preferred Stock so
converted shall be retired and cancelled and shall not be reissued as shares of such series, and the
Corporation (without the need for stockholder action) may from time to time take such
appropriate action as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of applicable
Series A Preferred Stock accordingly.

(iv) Upon any such conversion, no adjustment to the Series A
Conversion Price shall be made for any declared but unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred
Stock surrendered for conversion or on the Common Steck delivered upon conversion.

(v) The Corporation shall pay any and al! issue and other similar taxes
that may -be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon
conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section B.44. This specifically
does not include income, capital gains or similar taxes due from any holder of Series A Preferred
Stock. The Corporation shall not, however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in
respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a
name other than that in which the shares of Serics A Preferred Stock so converted were

AS29429 10

combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock without a comparable combination of the
Series A Preferred Stock or effect a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred

Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction:

Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of
business on such record date, and

(2) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of
business on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of
such dividend or distribution;

AS2942.7 17

ee eee mnie

Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event or (ii) a
dividend or other distribution of shares of Series A Preferred Stock which are convertible, as of

Stock) or in other property, then and in each such event the holders of Series A Preferred Stock

shall receive, simultaneously with the distribution to the holders of such capital stock, a dividend |

or other distribution of such securities or other property in an amount equal to the amount of
such securities or other property as they would have received if all outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event.

(e) Adjustment for Merger or Reorganization, etc. Subject to the provisions
of Section B.2, if there shall occur any reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
consolidation or merger involving the Corporation in which the Common Stock (but not the
