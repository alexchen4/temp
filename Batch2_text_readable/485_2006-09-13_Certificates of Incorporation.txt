Series D Preferred shall be entitled upon conversion shall be the product obtained by
multiplying the Series D Preferred Conversion Rate then in effect (determined as

(b) Series Preferred Conversion Rate. The conversion rate in effect
at any time for conversion of the Series A Preferred (the “Series A Preferred
‘Conversion Rate”) shall be the quotient obtained by dividing an amount equal to (i) the
Series A Original Issue Price by (ii) the Series A Preferred Conversion Price, calculated
as provided in Section 4(c). The conversion rate in effect at any time for conversion of
the Series B Preferred (the “Series B Preferred Conversion Rate”) shall be the quotient
obtained by dividing an amount equal to (i) the Series B Original Issue Price by (ii) the
Series B Preferred Conversion Price, calculated as provided in Section 4(c). The
Conversion rate in effect at any time for conversion of the Series C Preferred (the “Series

.9-
‘BUSDOCS/ 5829703

Price, calculated as provided in Section 4(c). The conversion rate in effect at any time for

be the quotient obtained by dividing (i) an amount equal to the Series D Original Issue
Price by (ii) the Series D Preferred Conversion Price, calculated as provided in Section
4(c).

Preferred Conversion Price, or Series D Preferred Conversion Price herein shall mean the

(d) Mechanics of Conversion. Each holder of Series Preferred who
desires to convert the same into shares of Common Stock pursuant to this Section 4 shail
surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the
Company or any transfer agent for the Series Preferred, and shall give written notice to
the Company at such office that such holder elects to convert the same. Such notice shall
state the number of whole shares of Series Preferred being converted. Thereupon, the
Company shall promptly issue and deliver at such office to such holder a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
and shall promptly pay in cash {at the Common Stock’s fair market value determined in
good faith by the Board of Directors as of the date of conversion) the value of any
fractional share of Common Stock otherwise issuable to any holder of Series Preferred,
No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of any shares of
Series Preferred. Whether or not fractional shares will result upon such conversion shall
be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Series Preferred the holder is
at the time converting into Common Stock and the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon such aggregate conversion. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been
made at the close of business on the date of such surrender of the certificates representing
the shares of Series Preferred to be converted, and the person entitled to receive the
Shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes
as the record holder of such shares of Common Stock on such date, If the conversion is

10-
BUSDOCS/1 5829703
in connection with an underwritten offering of securities registered pursuant to the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended or any other transaction set forth in Section 3(c), the
conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering shares of Series Preferred for
conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of securities
pursuant to such offering or the closing of such transaction, in which event the person or
entity entitled to receive the Common Stock upon conversion of the Series Preferred shall
not be deemed to have converted such Series Preferred until immediately prior to the
closing of such sale of securities or the closing of such transaction.

(e) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If the
Company shall at any time or from time to time after the date that the first share of
Series D Preferred is issued (the “Series D Original Issue Date”) effect a split or
subdivision of the outstanding Common Stock without a corresponding subdivision of the
Preferred Stock, the Series A Preferred Conversion Price, Series B Preferred Conversion
Price, Series C Preferred Conversion Price and Series D Preferred Conversion Price in
effect immediately before that split or subdivision shall be proportionately decreased.
Conversely, if the Company shall at any time or from time to time after the Series D
Original Issue Date combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller
number of shares without a corresponding combination of the Preferred Stock, the Series
A Preferred Conversion Price, the Series B Preferred Conversion Price, the Series C
_ Preferred Conversion Price and the Series D Preferred Conversion Price in effect
immediately before the combination shall be proportionately increased. Any adjustment
under this Section 4(e) shall become effective at the close of business on the date the
subdivision or combination becomes effective,

(f) Adjustment for Common Stock Dividends and Distributions.
If the Company at any time or from time to time after the Series D Original Issue Date
makes, or fixes a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled
to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of Common
Stock, in each such event the Series A Preferred Conversion Price, Series B Preferred
Conversion Price, Series C Preferred Conversion Price and Series D Preferred
Conversion Price that is then in effect shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance
or, in the event such record date is fixed, as of the close of business on such record date,
by multiplying the applicable conversion price then in effect by a fraction (i) the
numerator of which is the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of business on
such record date (as the case may be), and (ii) the denominator of which is the total
number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time
of such issuance or the close of business on such record date (as the case may be) plus the
number of shares of Common Stack issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution;
provided, however, that if such record date is fixed and such dividend is not fully paid or
if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the Series A Preferred
Conversion Price, Series B Preferred Conversion Price, Series C Preferred Conversion
Price and Series D Preferred Conversion Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the
close of business on such record date and thereafter the Series A Preferred Conversion

-11-
BUSDOCS/1 $82970.3
Price, Series B Preferred Conversion Price, Series C Preferred Conversion Price and
Series D Preferred Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this Section 4(f) to
reflect the actual payment of such dividend or distribution.

(g) Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. If
at any time or from time to time after the Series D Original Issue Date, the Common
Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Series Preferred is changed into the same ora
different number of shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification or otherwise (other than an Acquisition or Asset Transfer
as defined in Section 3(c) or a subdivision or combination of shares or stock dividend or a
reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale of assets provided for elsewhere in this
