entity; provided, however, that the issuance and sale of the shares of the Series E Preferred Stock
shall not be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of this Corporation.

(ii) In any of such events, if the consideration received by this
Corporation is other than cash, its value will be deemed its fair market value as determined in

similar restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of
a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be:

securities on such exchange or system over the thirty (30) day period (or portion thereof)
ending three (3) days prior to the closing;

(2) if actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over
the thirty (30) day period (or portion thereof) ending three (3) days prior to the closing;
and
(3) if there is no active public market, the value shall be the
fair market value thereof, as determined by the Board of Directors of this Corporation.

(B) ‘The method of valuation of securities subject to investment letter
or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue
of a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate
discount from the value determined as above in Section IV(B)(2)(h){ii)(A) to reflect the
approximate fair market value thereof, as determined by the Board of Directors of this
Corporation.

(iii) In the event the requirements of this Section IV(B)(2)(h) are not
complied with, this Corporation shall forthwith either:

(A) cause such closing to be postponed until such time as the
requirements of this Section IV(B)(2){h) have been complied with; or

(B) cancel such transaction, in which event the rights, preferences and
privileges of the holders of the Series E Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, Series
C-1 Preferred Stock, Series B-1 Preferred Stock, Series A-2 Preferred Stock and Series
A-1 Preferred Stock shall revert to and be the same as such rights, preferences and

Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, Series C-1 Preferred Stock, Series B-1 Preferred

The first of such notices shall describe the material terms and conditions of the impending
transaction, and this Corporation shall thereafter give such holders prompt notice of any material
changes. The transaction shall in no event take place sooner than twenty (20) days after this
Corporation has given the first notice provided for herein or sooner than ten (10) days after this
Corporation has given notice of any material changes provided for herein; provided, however,
that such periods may be shortened upon the written consent of the holders of Preferred Stock
that are entitled to such notice rights or similar notice rights and that represent at least a majority
of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of such Preferred Stock.

(a) Subject to the rights of Preferred Stock which may from time to time come
into existence, at any time after the fourth anniversary date of the initial closing of the sale of
shares of Series E Preferred Stock, after the receipt by the Corporation of a written request from
the holders of not less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the then outstanding Series E Preferred
Stock that all shares of Series E Preferred Stock be redeemed, the Corporation shall redeem from
any source of funds legally available therefor, the Series E Preferred Stock beginning on the
ninetieth (90th) day after the day of receipt of such written notice, and continuing thereafter on
the anniversary of such redemption date (each a “Series E Redemption Date”) until the sixth
anniversary of such date, whereupon the remaining Series E Preferred Stock outstanding shall be
redeemed, The Corporation shall effect such redemptions on the applicable Series E Redemption
Dates by paying in cash in exchange for the shares of Series E Preferred Stock to be redeemed a
sum equal to the Series E Liquidation Preference on such shares at such time of actual
redemption (the “Series E Redemption Price”). The number of shares of Series E Preferred
Stock that the Corporation shall be required under this Section 1V(B)(3)(a) to redeem on any one
Series E Redemption Date shall be equal to the amount determined by dividing the (i) the
aggregate number of shares of Series E Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Series E Redemption Date by (ii) the number of remaining Series E Redemption Dates
(including the Series D Redemption Date to which such calculation applies). Any redemption
effected pursuant to this Section IV(B)(3)(a) shall be made on a pro rata basis among the holders
of the Series E Preferred Stock in proportion to the number of shares of Series E Preferred Stock
then held by such holders. To the extent that the Corporation’s cash flow does not permit the full
amount of the Series E Redemption Price to be paid on any Series E Redemption Date, the
amount of the Series E Redemption Price which is not paid in cash on a Series E Redemption
Date shall be paid by the Corporation by the delivery of a promissory note, containing
commercially reasonable standard terms and bearing interest at the rate of 10% per annum to
each such holder of shares of Series E Preferred Stock.

sale of shares of Series D Preferred Stock, after the receipt by the Corporation of a written
request from the holders of not less than seventy-five percent (75%), of the then outstanding
Series D Preferred Stock that all shares of Series D Preferred Stock be redeemed, the
Corporation shall redeem from any source of funds legally available therefor, the Series D
Preferred Stock beginning on the ninetieth (90th) day after the day of receipt of such written
notice, and continuing thereafter on the anniversary of such redemption date (each a “Series D
Redemption Date”) until the sixth anniversary of such date, whereupon the remaining Series D
Preferred Stock outstanding shall be redeemed. The Corporation shall effect such redemptions
on the applicable Series D Redemption Dates by paying in cash in exchange for the shares of
Series D Preferred Stock to be redeemed a sum equal to the Series D Liquidation Preference on
such shares at such time of actual redemption (the “Series D Redemption Price”), The number
of shares of Series D Preferred Stock that the Corporation shall be required under this Section
IV(B)(3)(b) to redeem on any one Series D Redemption Date shall be equal to the amount
determined by dividing the (i) the aggregate number of shares of Series D Preferred Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Series D Redemption Date by (ii) the number of remaining
Series D Redemption Dates (including the Series D Redemption Date to which such calculation
applies), Any redemption effected pursuant to this Section IV(B)(3)(b) shail be made on a pro
rata basis among the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock in proportion to the number of
shares of Series D Preferred Stock then held by such holders. To the extent that the
Corporation’s cash flow does not permit the full amount of the Series D Redemption Price to be
paid on any Series D Redemption Date, the amount of the Series D Redemption Price which is
not paid in cash on a Series D Redemption Date shall be paid by the Corporation by the delivery
of a promissory note, containing commercially reasonable standard terms and bearing interest at
the rate of 10% per annum to each such holder of shares of Series D Preferred Stock.
(c) Asused in this Section IV(B)(3)(c) and in Section IV(B)(3)(d), the term
“Redemption Date” shall refer to each “Series E Redemption Date” and “Series D Redemption”
and the term “Redemption Price” shall refer to each Series E Redemption Price and Series D
Redemption Price. At least fifteen (15) but no more than thirty (30) days prior to a Redemption
Date, written notice shall be mailed, first class postage prepaid, to each holder of record (at the
close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given) of the
series of Preferred Stock to be redeemed and each other series of outstanding Preferred Stock
having redemption rights under this Section IV(B)(3), at the address last shown on the records of
this Corporation for such holder, (i) notifying such holder of the redemption to be effected on the
applicable Redemption Date, specifying the number of shares to be redeemed from such holder,
the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price, the place at which payment may be obtained and
calling upon such holder to surrender to this Corporation, in the manner and at the place
designated, his, her or its certificate or certificates representing the shares to be redeemed and (ii)
notifying any holder not already participating in such redemption of its rights, subject to the
requirements of this Sections IV(B)(3), as applicable, to participate in such redemption (the
"Redemption Notice"), In no event shall any redemption of any class of Preferred Stock be
effected prior to the last date on which each other class of Preferred Stock may also be redeemed
as specified in the Redemption Notice. Except as provided in Section IV(B)(3)(d), on or after a
Redemption Date, each holder of Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such Redemption Date shall

cancelled. No transfers of shares of Series E Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock shall
be permitted during the five (5) day period prior to and including any Series E Redemption Date

default in payment of the applicable Redemption Price, all rights of the series of Preferred Stock
designated for redemption on such Redemption Date in the Redemption Notice (except the right

certificates) shall cease with respect to such shares, and such shares shall not thereafter be

whatsoever.

certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of this Corporation or of any
transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to this Corporation at its
principal corporate office, of the election to convert the same and shall state therein the name or
names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued. This
Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such
holder of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as
aforesaid, Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of
business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the
person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion
shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock
as of such date. If the conversion is in connection with an underwritten offering of securities
registered pursuant to the Act, the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering
Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale
of securities pursuant to such offering, in which event the persons entitled to receive the

11
Common Stock upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted
such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities.

(d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock. The Conversion Prices
of the Series E Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, Series C-1 Preferred Stock, Series B-1

Preferred Stock and Series A Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as
follows:

(i) (A) If this Corporation shall issue, after the date hereof (the
“Purchase Date”), any Additional Stock (as defined below) without consideration or for a
consideration per share less than the Conversion Price for a particular series of Preferred Stock in
effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock, the Conversion Price for such
series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall forthwith (except
as otherwise provided in this Section IV(B)(4)(d)(i)) be adjusted to a price determined by
multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding and deemed issued pursuant to Section IV(B)(4)(d)(D(E)
immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the
aggregate consideration received by this Corporation for such issuance would purchase at such
Conversion Price; and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding and deemed issued pursuant to Section IV(B)(4)(d)(i)(E) immediately prior to such
issuance plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock.

(B) No adjustment of the Conversion Price for any series of Preferred
Stock shall be made in an amount less than one cent per share, provided that any
adjustments that are not required to be made by reason of this sentence shall be carried
forward and shall be either taken into account in any subsequent adjustment made prior to
three (3) years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried
forward, or shall be made at the end of three (3) years from the date of the event giving
rise to the adjustment being carried forward. Except to the limited extent provided for in
Sections IV(B)(4)(d)(i)(E)(3) and 1V(B)(4)(d)(i)(E)(®), no adjustment of such Conversion
Price pursuant to this Section IV(B)(4)(d)(i) shall have the effect of increasing the
Conversion Price above the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such
adjustment.

(C) In the case of the issuance of Additional Stock for cash, the
consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting
any reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by
this Corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and
sale thereof.

(D) _ In the case of the issuance of the Additional Stock for a
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall
be deemed to be the fair value thereof as determined by the Board of Directors
irrespective of any accounting treatment.

(E) Inthe case of the issuance (whether before, on or after the
applicable Purchase Date) of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common

12
Stock, securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock or
options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or exchangeable securities,
the following provisions shall apply for all purposes of this Section IV(B)(4)(d)(i) and
Section IV(B)(4)(d)(ii):

(1) The aggregate maximum number of shares of Common
Stock deliverable upon exercise (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to
exercisability, including, without limitation, the passage of time) of such options to
purchase or rights to subscribe for Common Stock shall be deemed to have been issued at
the time such options or rights were issued and for a consideration equal to the
consideration (determined in the manner provided in Sections 1V(B)(4)(d)(i)(C) and
IV(B)(4)(d\(D)), if any, received by this Corporation upon the issuance of such options
or rights plus the minimum exercise price provided in such options or rights for the
Common Stock covered thereby.

(2) The aggregate maximum number of shares of Common
Stock deliverable upon conversion of, or in exchange (assuming the satisfaction of any
conditions to exercisability, including, without limitation, the passage of time) for any
such convertible or exchangeable securities or upon the exercise of options to purchase or
rights to subscribe for such convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent
conversion or exchange thereof shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such
securities were issued or such options or rights were issued and for a consideration equal
to the consideration, if any, received by this Corporation for any such securities and
related options or rights (excluding any cash received on account of accrued interest or
accrued dividends), plus the minimum additional consideration, if any, to be received by
this Corporation upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or the exercise of
any related options or rights (the consideration in each case to be determined in the
manner provided in Sections IV(B)(4)(d)(i)(C) and IV(B)(4)(d)@D)).

(3) Inthe event of any change in the number of shares of

-Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to this Corporation upon

exercise of such options or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such
convertible or exchangeable securities, including, but not limited to, a change resulting
from the antidilution provisions thereof, the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred
Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, rights or
securities, shall be recomputed to reflect such change, but no further adjustment shall be
made for the actual issuance of Common Stock or any payment of such consideration
upon the exercise of any such options or rights or the conversion or exchange of such
securities. ,

(4) Upon the expiration of any such options or rights, the
termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options or
rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Conversion Price of each
series of Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such
options, rights or securities or options or rights related to such securities, shall be
recomputed to reflect the issuance of only the number of shares of Common Stock (and
convertible or exchangeable securities that remain in effect) actually issued upon the

13
exercise of such options or rights, upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or
upon the exercise of the options or rights related to such securities.

(5) The number of shares of Common Stock deemed issued
and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to Sections IV(B)(4)(d)(i)(E)(1) and
TV(B)(4)(d)(i)(E)(2) shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or
expiration of the type described in either Section IV(B)(4)(d)(i)(E)(3) or

relationships, provided such issuances are for other than primarily equity financing
purposes and (ii) shares of Common Stock, in any amount, issued or issuable to persons
or entities with which this Corporation has business relationships, provided such
issuances are for other than primarily equity financing purposes, so long as such
issuances (in excess of 200,000 shares) have been unanimously approved by the Board of
Directors of this Corporation and the holders of at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the
then outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock and Series E Preferred Stock voting
separately as a single class; or

14

time after the applicable Purchase Date fix a record date for the effectuation of a split or
subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or the determination of holders of
Common Stock entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of
Common Stock or other securities or rights convertible into, or entitling the holder thereof to
receive directly or indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock (hereinafter referred to as
“Common Stock Equivalents”) without payment of any consideration by such holder for the
additional shares of Common Stock or the Common Stock Equivalents (including the additional
shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof), then, as of such record
date (or the date of such dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no record date is fixed), the
Conversion Prices of each series of Preferred Stock shall be appropriately decreased so that the
number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be
increased in proportion to such increase in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding and those issuable with respect to such Common Stock Equivalents.

(iv) Ifthe number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any time
after the applicable Purchase Date is decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock, then, following the record date of such combination, the Conversion Prices for
each series of Preferred Stock shall be appropriately increased so that the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be decreased in
proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares,

(e) Other Distributions. In the event this Corporation shall declare a
distribution payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by this
Corporation or other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred
to in Section IV(B)(4)(d)(iii), then, in each such case for the purpose of this Section TV(B)(4)(e),
the holders of each series of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any such
distribution as though they were the holders of the number of shares of Common Stock of this
Corporation into which their shares of such series of Preferred Stock are convertible as of the
record date fixed for the determination of the holders of Common Stock of this Corporation
entitled to receive such distribution.

recapitalization of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision, combination or merger or sale
of assets transaction provided for elsewhere in Section IV(B)(2) or this Section IV(B)(4))
provision shall be made so that the holders of each series of the Preferred Stock shall thereafter
be entitled to receive upon conversion of such series of Preferred Stock the number of shares of
stock or other securities or property of this Corporation or otherwise, to which a holder of the
number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock held by
such holder would have been entitled on such recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate
adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section IV(B)(4) with
respect to the rights of the holders of each series of Preferred Stock after the recapitalization to
the end that the provisions of this Section IV(B)(4) (including adjustment of the Conversion

15
Price then in effect and the number of shares purchasable upon conversion of each such series of
Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event as nearly equivalent as may be practicable.

the holders of Preferred Stock against impairment,

(i) No fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of any
share or shares of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would
otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the then
fair market value of a share of Common Stock as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors, The number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon such conversion shall be
determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock the holder is at the time
converting into Common Stock and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such
aggregate conversion.

Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section IV(B)(4), this

such holder a like certificate setting forth (A) such adjustment and readjustment, (B) the
Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock at the time in effect, and (C) the number of
shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property that at the time would be

class or any other securities or property, or to receive any other right, this Corporation shal! mail
