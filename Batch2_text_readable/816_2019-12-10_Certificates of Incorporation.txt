RESOLVED, that Section 4 of Article V of the Restated Certificate be deleted
and replaced in full with the following:

“4. Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock and Nonvoting Common
Stock shall have conversion rights as follows:

(a) Right to Convert.

(i) Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of
the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share at the office of the
Corporation or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, into that number of fully-paid,
nonassessable shares of Common Stock determined by dividing the Original Issue Price for the
relevant Series by the Conversion Price for such series. In addition, each share of Series D
Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date
of issuance of such share at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for the Series D
Preferred Stock, into that number of fully-paid, nonassessable shares of Nonvoting Common
Stock determined by dividing the Original Issue Price by the Conversion Price of the Series D
Preferred Stock. The number of shares of Common Stock or Nonvoting Common Stock, as
applicable, into which each share of a Series of Preferred Stock may be converted is hereinafter
referred to as the “Conversion Rate” for each such Series. Upon any decrease or increase in the
Conversion Price for any Series of Preferred Stock, as described in this Section 4, the
Conversion Rate for such Series shall be appropriately increased or decreased.

(ii) Each share of Nonvoting Common Stock shall be convertible, at
the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share at the office
of the Corporation or any transfer agent for the Nonvoting Common Stock, into one fully-paid,
nonassessable share of Common Stock.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Series C Preferred Stock shall
automatically be converted into fully-paid, non-assessable shares of Common Stock and each
share of Series D Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into fully-paid, non-
assessable shares of Nonvoting Common Stock, in each case at the then effective Conversion
Rate for such share (i) immediately prior to the closing of a firm commitment underwritten initial
public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act of

GDS VF&H\4699066,6 2
1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), covering the offer and sale of the Common Stock,
provided that the aggregate gross offering proceeds to the Corporation are not less than
$300,000,000, or (ii) (A) with respect to the Series C Preferred Stock, upon the receipt by the
Corporation of a written request for such conversion from the holders of at least fifty-one percent
(51%) of the Series C Preferred Stock then outstanding (voting as a single class and on an as-
converted to Common Stock basis), or, if later, the effective date for conversion specified in such
requests, or (B) with respect to the Series D Preferred Stock, upon the receipt by the Corporation
of a written request for such conversion from the holders of at least fifty-one percent (51%) of
the Series D Preferred Stock then outstanding (voting as a single class and on an as-converted to
Common Stock basis), or, if later, the effective date for conversion specified in such requests
(each of the events referred to in (i) and (ii) are referred to herein as an “Automatic Conversion
Event”); provided, however, prior to an Automatic Conversion Event, upon the receipt by the
Corporation of a written request from a holder of Series D Preferred Stock, all or any portion (as
specified in such written request) of the then outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock held
by such holder may instead convert into that number of fully-paid, nonassessable shares of
Common Stock.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of Common Stock or
Nonvoting Common Stock, as applicable, shall be issued upon conversion of Preferred Stock. In
lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation
shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the then fair market value of a share of
Common Stock or Nonvoting Common Stock, as applicable, as determined by the Board of
Directors. For such purpose, all shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder of Preferred Stock
shall be aggregated, and any resulting fractional share of Common Stock and/or Nonvoting
Common Stock, as applicable, shall be paid in cash. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall
be entitled to convert the same into full shares of Common Stock and/or Nonvoting Common
Stock, as applicable,, and to receive certificates therefor, he shall either (A) surrender the
certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any
transfer agent for the Preferred Stock or (B) notify the Corporation or its transfer agent that such
certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and execute an agreement satisfactory to the
Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such
certificates, and shall give written notice to the Corporation at such office that be elects to
convert the same; provided, however, that on the date of an Automatic Conversion Event, the
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically without any further action
by the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates representing such shares are
surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent; provided further, however, that the
Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock
or Nonvoting Common Stock, as applicable, issuable upon such Automatic Conversion Event
unless either the certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are delivered to the
Corporation or its transfer agent as provided above, or the holder notifies the Corporation or its
transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an
agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred
by it in connection with such certificates. On the date of the occurrence of an Automatic
Conversion Event, each holder of record of shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to be the
holder of record of the Common Stock or Nonvoting Common Stock, as applicable, issuable
upon such conversion, notwithstanding that the certificates representing such shares of Preferred
Stock shall not have been surrendered at the office of the Corporation, that notice from the

GDS VF&H\4699066,6 3
Corporation shall not have been received by any holder of record of shares of Preferred Stock, or
that the certificates evidencing such shares of Common Stock or Nonvoting Common Stock shall
not then be actually delivered to such holder.

The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after such delivery, or after such
agreement and indemnification, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred
Stock, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock and/or Nonvoting
Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid and a check payable to such
holder in the amount of any cash amounts payable as the result of a conversion into fractional
shares of Common Stock and/or Nonvoting Common Stock, plus any declared and unpaid
dividends on the converted Preferred Stock. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been
made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of
Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of
Common Stock and/or Nonvoting Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated
for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock and/or
Nonvoting Common Stock, respectively, on such date; provided, however, that if the conversion
is in connection with an underwritten offer of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act
or a merger, sale, financing, or liquidation of the Corporation or ether event, the conversion may,
at the option of any holder tendering Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the
closing of such transaction or upon the occurrence of such event, in which case the person(s)
entitled to recetve the Common Stock and/or Nonvoting Common Stock, issuable upon such
conversion of the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock
until immediately prior to the closing of such transaction or the occurrence of such event.

(d) Adjustments to Conversion Price for Diluting Issues.

(i) Special Definition. For purposes of this paragraph 4(d),
“Additional Shares of Common” shall mean all shares of Common Stock issued (or, pursuant to
paragraph 4(d)(iii), deemed to be issued) by the Corporation after the filing of this Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation, other than the issuances or deemed issuances (such
issuances or deemed issuances, “Excluded Securities”) of:

(1) shares of Common Stock and options, warrants or other
rights to purchase Common Stock issued to employees, officers or directors of, or consultant or
advisors to the Corporation or any subsidiary pursuant to restricted stock purchase agreements,
stock option plans or similar arrangements;

(2) shares of Common Stock issued upon the exercise or
conversion of Options or Convertible Securities outstanding as of the date of the filing of this
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or upon the exercise or conversion of
Options or Convertible Securities counted against the limits set forth in subparagraph 4(d)(i)(1)
above;

(3) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable as a dividend or
distribution on Preferred Stock or pursuant to any event for which adjustment is made pursuant
to paragraph 4(e), 4(f) or 4(g) hereof;

GDS VF&H\4699066,6 4
(4) shares of Common Stock issued in a registered public
offering under the Securities Act;

(5) shares of Common Stock issued in connection with a bona
fide business acquisition by this corporation, whether by merger, consolidation, sale of assets,
sale or exchange of stock or otherwise, provided, that such issuances are approved by the Board
of Directors;

(6) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable to banks,
equipment lessors or other financial institutions pursuant to a debt financing or commercial
leasing transaction approved by the Board of Directors;

(7) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable in connection
with sponsored research, collaboration, technology license, development, OEM, marketing or
other similar agreements or strategic partnerships approved by the Board of Directors;

(8) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable to suppliers or
third party service providers in connection with the provision of goods or services pursuant to
transactions approved by the Board of Directors; and

(9) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable in connection
with a transaction not contemplated by subsections (5) — (8) above, including, without limitation
in connection with a bona fide financing transaction; provided that the Corporation repurchases
or cancels an equal or greater number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation (other than
A12 Stock) and/or options to purchase capital stock of the Corporation within ninety (90) days of
such issuance of Common Stock in such transaction (all such repurchased capital stock and/or
cancelled options to purchase capital stock the “Redeemed Shares and Options”); and provided
further that the gross price per share paid by the Corporation in connection with any such
Redeemed Shares and Options is equal to or less than the gross price per share received by the
Corporation in connection with the corresponding financing transaction.

(ii) No Adjustment of Conversion Price; Tolling. No adjustment in the
Conversion Price of a particular Series of Preferred Stock shall be made in respect of the
issuance of Additional Shares of Common unless the consideration per share (as determined
pursuant to paragraph 4(d)(v)) for an Additional Share of Common issued or deemed to be
issued by the Corporation is less than the Conversion Price in effect on the date of, and
immediately prior to, such issue, for such Series of Preferred Stock. In addition, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth herein, in the event of an issuance or deemed issuance of shares
of Common Stock by the Corporation pursuant to paragraph 4(d)(i)(9), which will be followed
by a repurchase and/or cancellation of Redeemed Shares and Options, no adjustment in the
Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock shall be made until the ninetieth (90") day
following such issuance of shares of Common Stock (the “Repurchase Tolling Date”). On the
Repurchase Tolling Date, the Corporation will determine the number of Redeemed Shares and
Options that have been repurchased and/or cancelled by the Corporation. If the number of
Redeemed Shares and Options repurchased and/or cancelled by the Corporation within the ninety
(90) days following the issuance or deemed issuance of shares of shares of Common Stock by
the Corporation pursuant to paragraph 4(d)(i)(9) is equal to or greater than the number of shares

GDS VF&H\4699066,6 5
of shares of Common Stock issued in connection with such transaction, no adjustment shall be
made to the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4,
provided, however, that if the number of Redeemed Shares and Options repurchased and/or
cancelled by the Corporation within the ninety (90) days following the issuance or deemed
issuance of shares of Common Stock by the Corporation pursuant to paragraph 4(d)(i)(9) is less
than the number of shares of Common Stock issued in connection with such transaction, the
positive difference between (x) the number of shares of Common Stock issued or deemed issued
pursuant to paragraph 4(d)(i)(9) and (y) the number of Redeemed Shares and Options actually
repurchased and/or cancelled prior to the Repurchase Tolling Date (the “Repurchase Shortfall
Shares”) shall be deemed Additional Shares of Common for the purposes of this Section 4 and
each series of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to any applicable Conversion Price adjustment
pursuant to Section 4(d)({iv) related to the issuance or deemed issuance of the Repurchase
Shortfall Shares (unless such adjustment is otherwise waived pursuant to Section 4(i)).

(iii) Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the date of the filing of this Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall issue any Options or Convertible Securities or shall
fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive any
such Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of shares (as set forth in the
instrument relating thereto without regard to any provisions contained therein for a subsequent
adjustment of such number) of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Options or, in
the case of Convertible Securities, the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities or,
in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options and the conversion
or exchange of the underlying securities, shall be deemed to have been issued as of the time of
such issue or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such
record date, provided that in any such case in which shares are deemed to be issued:

(1) no further adjustment in the Conversion Price of any Series
of Preferred Stock shall be made upon the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities or shares of
Common Stock in connection with the exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of
such Convertible Securities;

(2) if such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms
provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any change in the consideration payable to the
Corporation or in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion
or exchange thereof (other than a change pursuant to the anti-dilution provisions of such Options
or Convertible Securities such as this Section 4(d) or pursuant to Recapitalization provisions of
such Options or Convertible Securities such as Sections 4(e), 4(f) and 4(g) hereof), the
Conversion Price of each Series of Preferred Stock and any subsequent adjustments based
thereon shall be recomputed to reflect such change as if such change had been in effect as of the
original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of the record date with respect thereto);

(3) no readjustment pursuant to clause (2) above shall have the
effect of increasing the Conversion Price of a Series of Preferred Stock to an amount above the
Conversion Price that would have resulted from any other issuances of Additional Shares of
Common and any other adjustments provided for herein between the original adjustment date
and such readjustment date;

GDS VF&H\4699066,6 6
(4) upon the expiration of any such Options or any rights of
conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have been exercised,
the Conversion Price of each Series of Preferred Stock computed upon the original issue thereof
(or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto) and any subsequent adjustments
based thereon shall, upon such expiration, be recomputed as if:

(a) in the case of Convertible Securities or Options for
Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common issued were the shares of Common
Stock, if any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of
such Convertible Securities and the consideration received therefor was the consideration
actually received by the Corporation for the issue of such exercised Options plus the
consideration actually received by the Corporation upon such exercise or for the issue of all such
Convertible Securities which were actually converted or exchanged, plus the additional
consideration, if any, actually received by the Corporation upon such conversion or exchange,
and

(b) in the case of Options for Convertible Securities,
only the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were issued at
the time of issue of such Options, and the consideration received by the Corporation for the
Additional Shares of Common deemed to have been then issued was the consideration actually
received by the Corporation for the issue of such exercised Options, plus the consideration
deemed to have been received by the Corporation (determined pursuant to Section 4(d)(v)) upon
the issue of the Convertible Securities with respect to which such Options were actually
exercised; and

(5) if such record date shall have been fixed and such Options
or Convertible Securities are not issued on the date fixed therefor, the adjustment previously
made in the Conversion Price which became effective on such record date shall be canceled as of
the close of business on such record date, and thereafter the Conversion Price shall be adjusted
pursuant to this paragraph 4(d)(iii) as of the actual date of their issuance.

(iv) Adjustment_of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional
Shares of Common, In the event this Corporation shall issue Additional Shares of Common

Stock (including Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to paragraph
4(d)(ii1)) without consideration or for a price per share less than the applicable Conversion Price
of a Series of Preferred Stock in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such issue, then,
the Conversion Price of the affected Series of Preferred Stock shall be reduced, concurrently
with such issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying such
Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of shares which the
aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of
Common so issued would purchase at such Conversion Price, and the denominator of which
shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus
the number of such Additional Shares of Common so issued. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Conversion Price shall not be reduced at such time if the amount of such reduction would be less
than $0.01, but any such amount shall be carried forward, and a reduction will be made with
respect to such amount at the time of, and together with, any subsequent reduction which,

GDS VF&H\4699066,6 q
together with such amount and any other amounts so carried forward, equal $0.01 or more in the
aggregate. For the purposes of this Subsection 4(d)(iv), all shares of Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock and the exercise and/or conversion
of any other outstanding Convertible Securities and all outstanding Options shall be deemed to
be outstanding.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this subsection
4(d), the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue (or deemed issue) of any
Additional Shares of Common shall be computed as follows:

(1) Cash and Property. Such consideration shall:

(a) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
aggregate amount of cash received by the Corporation before deducting any reasonable
discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the Corporation for any
underwriting or otherwise in connection with such issuance;

(b) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair market value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith
by the Board of Directors; and

(c) in the event Additional Shares of Common are
issued together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for consideration
which covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in
clauses (a) and (b) above, as reasonably determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(2) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per
share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common deemed to have been issued

pursuant to paragraph 4(d)(iii) shall be determined by dividing:

(a) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by
the Corporation as consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the
minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating
thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such
consideration) payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the
exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities by

(b) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock
(as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein
for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities.

(e) Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of Common Stock. In the
event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided (by stock split, by payment

of a stock dividend or otherwise occurring after the date of the filing of this Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation) into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the

GDS VF&H\4699066,6 8
Conversion Price of each Series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such
subdivision shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such subdivision, be proportionately
decreased. In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined (by
reclassification or otherwise) into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion
Prices in effect immediately prior to such combination shall, concurrently with the effectiveness
of such combination, be proportionately increased. In the event the outstanding shares of
Common Stock shall be subdivided (by stock split, by payment of a stock dividend or otherwise
occurring after the date of the filing of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation)
into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the shares of Nonvoting Common Stock shall
be subdivided in the same fashion. In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall
be combined (by reclassification or otherwise) into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock,
the shares of Nonvoting Common Stock shall be combined in the same fashion.

(f) Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of Preferred Stock. In the
event the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock or a Series of Preferred Stock shall be subdivided
(by stock split, by payment of a stock dividend or otherwise occurring after the date of the filing
of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation) into a greater number of shares of
Preferred Stock, the Dividend Rate, Original Issue Price and Liquidation Preference of the
affected Series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall,
concurrently with the effectiveness of such subdivision, be proportionately decreased. In the
event the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock or a Series of Preferred Stock shall be combined
(by reclassification or otherwise) into a lesser number of shares of Preferred Stock, the Dividend
Rate, Original Issue Price and Liquidation Preference of the affected Series of Preferred Stock in
effect immediately prior to such combination shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such
combination, be proportionately increased.

(g) Adjustments for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. Subject to
Section 3 above (“Liquidation Rights”), if the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the

Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of any other class
or classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a
subdivision or combination of shares provided for above), then, in any such event, in lieu of the
number of shares of Common Stock which the holders would otherwise have been entitled to
receive, each holder of such Preferred Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such shares
of Preferred Stock into a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock which a holder
of the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of such Series of
Preferred Stock immediately before that change would have been entitled to receive in such
reorganization or reclassification, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein with
respect to such other shares.

(h) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation at its expense
shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and
furnish to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or
readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is
based. The Corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of Preferred
Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such
adjustments and readjustments, (ii) the Conversion Price at the time in effect and (111) the number

GDS V F&H\4699066,6 9
of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the tithe would be
received upon the conversion of Preferred Stock.

(i) Waiver of Adjustment of Conversion Price. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, any downward adjustment of the Conversion Price of any Series of

Preferred Stock may be waived (i) by the consent or vote of the holders of at least fifty-one
percent (51%) of the outstanding shares of such Series either before or after the issuance causing
the adjustment, and (it) solely with respect to Series D Preferred Stock, by the vote or written
consent of the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding Series D Preferred Stock.

G) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at
all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock

and Nonvoting Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares
of the Preferred Stock, such number of its shares of Common Stock and Nonvoting Common
Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding
shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of
Common Stock and Nonvoting Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of
all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate
action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock and Nonvoting Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be
sufficient for such purpose.”

THIRD: That thereafter said amendment was duly adopted in accordance with
the provisions of Section 242 of the General Corporation Law by written consent of the
stockholders holding the requisite number of shares required by statute given in accordance with
and pursuant to Section 228 of the General Corporation Law.
