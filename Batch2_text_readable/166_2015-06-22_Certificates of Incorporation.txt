of Series F Preferred Stock, (ii) adversely impact the liquidation preferences of Series F Preferred Stock
upon a Liquidation Event (as defined below) or (iii) adversely impact the rights, preferences or privileges
of Series F Preferred Stock differently than such action impacts the rights, preferences or privileges of the

privileges of Series Preferred in the same way, then such action will not be deemed to impact the holders
of Series F Preferred Stock differently than the rights, preferences and privileges of the other Series
Preferred, despite any possible differences in economic or other outcome).

of Series E Preferred Stock remain outstanding, in addition to any other vote or consent required herein or
by law, the vote or written consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Series E Preferred Stock

merger, consolidation, reorganization or otherwise) if such action would (i) increase the authorized shares
of Series E Preferred Stock or (ii) adversely impact the liquidation preferences of Series E Preferred Stock
upon a Liquidation Event (as defined below).

shares of Series E-1 Preferred Stock shall be entitled to vote solely on matters relating to the election and

117073370 v5
(iv) | No person entitled to vote at an election for directors may
cumulate votes to which such person is entitled, unless, at the time of such election, the Company is
subject to Section 2115 of the CGCL. During such time or times that the Company is subject to Section
2115(b) of the CGCL, every stockholder entitled to vote at an election for directors may cumulate such
stockholder’s votes and give one (1) candidate a number of votes equal to the number of directors to be
elected multiplied by the number of votes to which such stockholder’s shares are otherwise entitled, or
distribute the stockholder’s votes on the same principle among as many candidates as such stockholder
desires. No stockholder, however, shall be entitled to so cumulate such stockholder’s votes unless (i) the
names of such candidate or candidates have been placed in nomination prior to the voting and (ii) the
stockholder has given notice at the meeting, prior to the voting, of such stockholder’s intention to
cumulate such stockholder’s votes. If any stockholder has given proper notice to cumulate votes, all
stockholders may cumulate their votes for any candidates who have been properly placed in nomination.
Under cumulative voting, the candidates receiving the highest number of votes, up to the number of
directors to be elected, are elected.

(v) Removal. During such time or times that the Company is subject
to Section 2115(b) of the CGCL, one or more directors may be removed from office at any time without
cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote
for that director as provided above; provided, however, that unless the entire Board is removed, no
individual director may be removed when the votes cast against such director’s removal, or not
consenting in writing to such removal, would be sufficient to elect that director if voted cumulatively at
an election which the same total number of votes were cast (or, if such action is taken by written consent,
all shares entitled to vote were voted) and the entire number of directors authorized at the time of such
director’s most recent election were then being elected.

respect to Series F Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock and each series of Junior Preferred Stock,
the holders of Series F Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock or such series of Junior Preferred Stock,
as applicable, have received pursuant to Section 3(b) above, Section 3(d) above, Section 3(e) above,
respectively, and this Section 3(f) an aggregate amount per share of Series F Preferred Stock, Series D
Preferred Stock or such series of Junior Preferred Stock, as applicable, equal to two (2) times the
applicable Original Issue Price; and (iii) with respect to Series G Preferred Stock, the holders of Series G
Preferred Stock have received pursuant to Section 3(a) above and this Section 3(f) an aggregate amount
per share of Series G Preferred Stock equal to the applicable Original Issue Price plus all declared and
unpaid dividends on Series G Preferred Stock; thereafter, the remaining assets of the Company legally
available for distribution in such Liquidation Event (or the consideration received in such transaction), if
any, shall be distributed ratably to the holders of the Common Stock.

4. ASSET TRANSFER OR ACQUISITION RIGHTS.

(a) Notwithstanding Section 3(a), Section 3(b), Section 3(c), Section 3(d),
Section 3(e) and Section 3(f) above, solely for purposes of determining the amount each holder of Series
Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock is entitled to receive with respect to an Acquisition or Asset
Transfer, at the closing of any Acquisition or Asset Transfer with respect to which amounts are to be
legally distributed to the Company’s stockholders and at each date after such closing on which additional
amounts (such as earnout payments, escrow amounts or other contingent payments) are to be legally
distributed to the Company’s stockholders as a result of such Acquisition or Asset Transfer (each, a
“Payment Date”), each holder of Series Preferred and Series E-1 Preferred Stock shall be entitled to be
paid, out of the assets of the Company legally available for distribution (or the consideration received in
such transaction) on such Payment Date, an amount for each share of Series Preferred and Series E-1
Preferred Stock held upon the closing of such Liquidation Event equal to: (i) the greater of the amount of
cash, securities and other property to which such holder would have been entitled (after taking into
account the operation of this Section 4(a) with respect to all series of Series Preferred and Series E-]
Preferred Stock and treating the distributions to the Company’s stockholders made upon such Payment
Date and all prior Payment Dates as having been made simultaneously upon the closing of the
Acquisition or the Asset Transfer): (A) pursuant to Sections 3{a), 3(b), 3(c), 3(d), 3(e) and 3(f) above or
(B) if all shares of Series Preferred and Series E-1 Preferred Stock had converted to Common Stock
pursuant to Section 5 as of immediately prior to the closing of such Acquisition or Asset Transfer;
reduced by (ii) the amount per share paid in the aggregate to such holder pursuant to Sections 3(a)
through 3(f) above with respect to such holder’s Series Preferred and Series E-1 Preferred Stock on all
prior Payment Dates; provided, however, that the fair market value of any non-cash consideration that
may be distributed to the Company’s stockholders on each Payment Date shall be determined at the date
of the closing of the Acquisition or Asset Transfer in accordance with Section 4(c).

(b) For the purposes of Section 3 above and this Section 4: (i) “Acquisition”
shall mean (A) any consolidation, stock exchange or merger of the Company with or into any other
corporation or other entity or person, or any other corporate reorganization, in which the stockholders of
the Company immediately prior to such consolidation, merger or reorganization, own less than 50% of
the voting power of the surviving entity immediately after such consolidation, merger or reorganization or
(B) any transaction or series of related transactions (whether by merger, consolidation, stock exchange or
otherwise) in which fifty percent (50%) or more of the Company’s voting power is transferred; provided
that an Acquisition shall not include (x) any consolidation or merger effected exclusively to change the
domicile of the Company, (y) any consolidation or merger with a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company for the primary purpose of creating a bolding company that will be owned substantially in the
same proportions by the persons and entities that hold this Company’s securities immediately prior to
such transaction, or (z) any transaction or series of transactions principally for bona fide equity financing
purposes in which the Company is the surviving corporation; and (ii) “Asset Transfer” shall mean a sale,
lease, conveyance, exclusive license or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company; provided, that if (1) the holders of at least two-thirds of Series Preferred, voting together as a

9.
ACTIVE/82650060.4 120193-242355
117073370 v5
single class on an as-if-converted basis, (II) the holders of a majority of Series F Preferred Stock and (III)
the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the outstanding Series G Preferred
Stock elect not to treat an Acquisition or Asset Transfer as a Liquidation Event, such Acquisition or Asset
Transfer shall be deemed not to constitute a Liquidation Event.

(c) In any Acquisition or Asset Transfer, if the consideration to be received
is securities of a corporation or other property other than cash, its value will be deemed its fair market
value. Any securities shall be valued as follows:

(i) Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar
restrictions on free marketability:

(A) _ If traded on a securities exchange or The Nasdaq Stock
Market (“Nasdaq”), the value shall be based on a formula approved by the Board and derived from the
closing prices of the securities on such exchange or Nasdaq over a specified time period;

(B) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be
based on a formula approved by the Board and derived from the closing bid or sales prices (whichever is
applicable) of such securities over a specified time period; and

(C) if there is no active public market, the value shall be the
fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board.

(ii) The method of valuation of securities subject to investment letter
or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of a
stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount from the
market value determined as specified above in Section 4(c){i) to reflect the approximate fair market value
thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board.

5. CONVERSION RIGHTS.

The holders of Series Preferred and Series E-1 Preferred Stock shall have the
following rights with respect to the conversion of Series Preferred and Series E-1 Preferred Stock into
shares of Common Stock (the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Optional Conversion. Subject to and in compliance with the provisions
of this Section 5, any shares of Series Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock may, at the option of the
holder, be converted at any time into fully-paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock. The number
of shares of Common Stock to which a holder of Series Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock shall be
entitled upon conversion shall be the product obtained by multiplying the “Series Preferred Conversion
Rate” then in effect for such series (determined as provided in Section 5(b)) by the number of shares of
Series Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock being converted.

(b) Series Preferred Conversion Rate. The conversion rate in effect at any
time for conversion of any series of Series Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock (the “Series Preferred
Conversion Rate” for such series) shall be the quotient obtained by dividing the Original Issue Price of
such series of Series Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock by the applicable “Series Preferred
Conversion Price,” calculated as provided in Section 5(c).

(c) Series Preferred Conversion Price. The conversion price for any series
of Series Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock shall initially be the Original Issue Price of such series
of Series Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock (the “Conversion Price” or for all series of Series
Preferred and Series E-] Preferred Stock, the “Series Preferred Conversion Price”). Such initial Series
Preferred Conversion Price shal] be adjusted from time to time in accordance with this Section 5. All

10.
ACTIVE/82650060.4 120193-242355
117073370 v5
references to Series Preferred Conversion Price herein shall mean the applicable Series Preferred
Conversion Price as so adjusted.

(da) Mechanics of Conversion. Each holder of Series Preferred or Series E-1
Preferred Stock who desires to convert the same into shares of Common Stock pursuant to this Section 5
shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Company or any
transfer agent for Series Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock, as applicable, and shall give written
notice to the Company at such office that such holder elects to convert the same. Such notice shall state
the number of shares of Series Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock being converted. Thereupon, the
Company shall promptly issue and deliver at such office to such holder a certificate or certificates for the
number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled and shall promptly pay (i) in cash or,
to the extent sufficient funds are not then legally available therefor, in Common Stock (at the Common
Stock’s fair market value determined by the Board as of the date of such conversion), any declared and
unpaid dividends on the shares of Series Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock being converted and (ii)
in cash (at the Common Stock’s fair market value determined by the Board as of the date of conversion)
the value of any fractional share of Common Stock otherwise issuable to any holder of Series Preferred or
Series E-] Preferred Stock. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made at the close of business
on the date of such surrender of the certificates representing the shares of Series Preferred or Series E-1
Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable
upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such shares of Common
Stock on such date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the conversion is in connection with an
underwritten offering of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the
conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering Series Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock for
conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to
such offering, in which event the persons entitled to receive the Common Stock upon conversion of Series
Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Series Preferred or
Series E-1 Preferred Stock, as applicable until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities.

(e) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If at any time or from
time to time after the date that the first share of Series F Preferred Stock is issued (the “Original Issue
Date”) the Company effects a subdivision of the outstanding Common Stock without a corresponding
subdivision of any series of Series Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock, the applicable Series Preferred
Conversion Price in effect immediately before that subdivision shall be proportionately decreased.
Conversely, if at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date the Company combines the
outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares without a corresponding
combination of any series of Series Preferred or Series E-| Preferred Stock, the applicable Series
Preferred Conversion Price in effect immediately before the combination shall be proportionately
increased. Any adjustment under this Section S(e) shall become effective at the close of business on the
date the subdivision or combination becomes effective.

(f) Adjustment for Common Stock Dividends and Distributions. [f at
any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date the Company pays to holders of Common
Stock a dividend or other distribution in additional shares of Common Stock without a corresponding
dividend or other distribution to holders of Series Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock, each Series
Preferred Conversion Price that is then in effect shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance, as
provided below:

(i) Each Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be adjusted by
multiplying each Series Preferred Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction equal to:

(A) the numerator of which is the total number of shares of
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance, and

ACTIVE/82650060.4 120193-242355
117073370 v5
(B) — the denominator of which is the total number of shares
of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance plus the number
of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution;

(ii) If the Company fixes a record date to determine which holders of
Common Stock are entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution, the applicable Series Preferred
Conversion Price shall be fixed as of the close of business on such record date and the number of shares
of Common Stock shall be calculated immediately prior to the close of business on such record date; and

(iii) If such record date is fixed and such dividend is not fully paid or
if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, each Series Preferred Conversion Price
shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record date and thereafter each Series
Preferred Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this Section 5(f} to reflect the actual payment of
such dividend or distribution.

(iv) In the event the Company shali declare a distribution payable in
securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by the Company or other persons, assets
(excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred to in Section 5(e) above to holders of
Common Stock without a corresponding distribution to holders of Series Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred
Stock, then, in each such case for the purpose of this Section 5(f), the holders of Series Preferred or Series
E-1 Preferred Stock, as applicable, shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any such distribution as
though they were the holders of the number of shares of Common Stock of this Company into which their
shares of Series Preferred or Series E-| Preferred Stock are convertible as of the record date fixed for the
determination of the holders of Common Stock of this Company entitled to receive such distribution.

(g) Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange, Substitution,
Reorganization, Merger or Consolidation. If at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue
Date, the Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of Series Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock
is changed into the same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by
recapitalization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or otherwise (other than an Acquisition or Asset
Transfer as defined in Section 4 or a subdivision or combination of shares or stock dividend or a
reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale of assets provided for elsewhere in this Section 5), in any
such event each holder of Series Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock shall then have the right but shall
have no obligation to convert such stock into the kind and amount of stock and other securities and
property receivable upon such recapitalization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or other change by
holders of the maximum number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series Preferred
or Series E-1 Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately prior to such recapitalization,
reclassification, merger, consolidation or change, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein or
with respect to such other securities or property by the terms thereof. In any such case, appropriate
adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 5 with respect to the rights of
the holders of Series Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock after the capital reorganization to the end
that the provisions of this Section 5 (including adjustment of the applicable Series Preferred Conversion
Price then in effect and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of such Series Preferred or Series
E-1 Preferred Stock, as applicable) shall be applicable after that event and be as nearly equivalent as
practicable.

(h) Sale of Shares Below Series G Preferred Conversion Price, Series F
Preferred Conversion Price, Series D Preferred Conversion Price, Series C Preferred Conversion
Price, or Series E Preferred Conversion Price, as applicable.

(i) If at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date,
the Company issues or sells, or is deemed by the express provisions of this Section 5(h) to have issued or
sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock (as defined below) other than as provided in Section 5(f) or
5(g) above, for an Effective Price (as defined below) less than (1) in the case of Series A Preferred Stock,

12.
ACTIVE/82650060.4 120193-242355
1) 7073370 vS
Series B Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock, and Series E-1 Preferred Stock, the then effective
Conversion Price for Series E Preferred Stock, (2) in the case of Series C Preferred Stock, the then
effective Conversion Price for Series C Preferred Stock, (3) in the case of Series D Preferred Stock, the
then effective Conversion Price for Series D Preferred Stock, (4) in the case of Series F Preferred Stock,
the then effective Conversion Price for Series F Preferred Stock, or (5) in the case of Series G Preferred
Stock, the then effective Conversion Price for Series G Preferred Stock,, respectively (the Conversion
Prices so referenced in (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) being the “Applicable Anti-Dilution Reference Price”),
then and in each such case (each, a “Qualifying Additional Issuance”) the then existing Series Preferred
Conversion Price for a series of Series Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock shall be reduced, as
applicable, as of the opening of business on the date of such issue or sale, to a price determined by
multiplying the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance
or sale by a fraction equal to:

(A) the numerator of which shall be (A) the number of
shares of Common Stock deemed outstanding (as determined below) immediately prior to such issue or
sale, plus (B) the number of shares of Common Stock which the Aggregate Consideration (as defined
below) received or deemed received by the Company for the total number of Additional Shares of
Common Stock so issued would purchase at the Applicable Anti-Dilution Reference Price, and

(B) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares
of Common Stock deemed outstanding (as determined below) immediately prior to such issue or sale plus
the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued.

For the purposes of the preceding sentence, the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be
outstanding as of a given date shall be the sum of (A) the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding, (B) the number of shares of Common Stock into which the then outstanding shares of Series
Preferred and Series E-1 Preferred Stock could be converted if fully converted on the day immediately
preceding the given date, and (C) the number of shares of Common Stock which are issuable upon the
exercise or conversion of all other rights, options and convertible securities outstanding on the day
immediately preceding the given date.

(ii) No adjustment shall be made to any Series Preferred Conversion
Price in an amount less than one cent per share. Any adjustment otherwise required by this Section 5(h)
that is not required to be made due to the preceding sentence shall be included in any subsequent
adjustment to such Series Preferred Conversion Price.

(iii) = For the purpose of making any adjustment required under this
Section 5(h), the aggregate consideration received by the Company for any issue or sale of securities (the
“Aggregate Consideration”) shall be defined as: (A) to the extent it consists of cash, be computed at the
net amount of cash received by the Company after deduction of any underwriting or similar commissions,
compensation or concessions paid or allowed by the Company in connection with such issue or sale but
without deduction of any expenses payable by the Company, (B) to the extent it consists of property other
than cash, be computed at the fair value of that property as determined in good faith by the Board
irrespective of any accounting treatment, and (C) if Additional Shares of Common Stock, Convertible
Securities (as defined below) or rights or options to purchase either Additional Shares of Common Stock
or Convertible Securities are issued or sold together with other stock or securities or other assets of the
Company for a consideration which covers both, be computed as the portion of the consideration so
received that may be reasonably determined in good faith by the Board to be allocable to such Additional
Shares of Common Stock, Convertible Securities or rights or options.

(iv) For the purpose of the adjustment required under this Section
S(h), if the Company issues or sells (x) Preferred Stock or other stock, options, warrants, purchase rights
or other securities convertible or exchangeable into, Additional Shares of Common Stock (such
convertible or exchangeable stock or securities being herein referred to as “Convertible Securities”) or (y)

13.
ACTIVE/82650060.4 120193-242355
117073370 v5
rights or options for the purchase of Additional Shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities and if
the Effective Price of such Additional Shares of Common Stock is less than any Series Preferred
Conversion Price, in each case the Company shall be deemed to have issued at the time of the issuance of
such rights or options or Convertible Securities the maximum number of Additional Shares of Common
Stock issuable upon exercise or conversion or exchange thereof and to have received as consideration for
the issuance of such shares an amount equal to the total amount of the consideration, if any, received by
the Company for the issuance of such rights or options or Convertible Securities plus:

(A) in the case of such rights or options, the minimum
amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon the exercise of such rights or options; and

(B) in the case of Convertible Securities, the minimum
amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon the conversion or exchange thereof (other
than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities); provided that
if the minimum amounts of such consideration cannot be ascertained, but are a function of antidilution or
similar protective clauses, the Company shall be deemed to have received the minimum amounts of
consideration without reference to such clauses.

(C) If the minimum amount of consideration payable to the
Company upon the exercise or conversion of rights, options or Convertible Securities is reduced over time
or on the occurrence or non-occurrence of specified events other than by reason of antidilution
adjustments, the Effective Price shall be recalculated using the figure to which such minimum amount of
consideration is reduced; provided further, that if the minimum amount of consideration payable to the
Company upon the exercise or conversion or exchange of such rights, options or Convertible Securities is
subsequently increased, the Effective Price shall be again recalculated using the increased minimum
amount of consideration payable to the Company upon the exercise or conversion or exchange of such
rights, options or Convertible Securities.

(D) No further adjustment of any Series Preferred
Conversion Price, as adjusted upon the issuance of such rights, options or Convertible Securities, shall be
made as a result of the actual issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock or the exercise of any such
rights or options or the conversion of any such Convertible Securities. If any such rights or options or the
conversion privilege represented by any such Convertible Securities shall expire without having been
exercised, the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price as adjusted upon the issuance of such rights,
options or Convertible Securities shall be readjusted to Series Preferred Conversion Price which would
have been in effect had an adjustment been made on the basis that the only Additional Shares of Common
Stock so issued were the Additional Shares of Common Stock, if any, actually issued or sold on the
exercise of such rights or options or rights of conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, and
such Additional Shares of Common Stock, if any, were issued or sold for the consideration actually
received by the Company upon such exercise, plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the
Company for the granting of all such rights or options, whether or not exercised, plus the consideration
received for issuing or selling the Convertible Securities actually converted or exchanged, plus the
consideration, if any, actually received by the Company (other than by cancellation of liabilities or
obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities) on the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, provided that such readjustment shall not apply to prior conversions of Series Preferred or
Series E-1 Preferred Stock.

(v) For the purpose of making any adjustment to the Conversion
Price of Series Preferred or Series E-] Preferred Stock required under this Section 5(h), “Additional
Shares of Common Stock” shail mean all shares of Common Stock issued by the Company or deemed to
be issued pursuant to this Section 5(h) (including shares of Common Stock subsequently reacquired or
retired by the Company), other than:

employees, officers or directors of, or consultants or advisors to the Company or any subsidiary, pursuant
to stock purchase or stock option plans or other arrangements that are unanimously approved by the
Board of Directors; provided, however, that such amount shall be increased to reflect any shares of
Common Stock (i) which are not issued due to the expiration or termination of an option, right or
agreement to acquire such stock, and which have reverted to and are again issuable under the Plan
(“Unexercised Options”) or (ii) reacquired by the Company from employees, directors or consultants at
cost (or the lesser of cost or fair market value) pursuant to agreements which permit the Company to
repurchase such shares upon termination of services to the Company;

Preferred Stock as provided in Section 5({a) hereof, or (ii) pursuant to the provisions for the automatic
conversion of such Series Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock as provided in Section 5(k) hereof;

ventures, manufacturing, marketing or distribution arrangements or (ii) technology transfer or
development arrangements; provided that the issuance of shares therein has been approved by the
Company’s Board and provided that the issuance of such shares is primarily for purposes other than the
raising of additional capital through an equity financing; and

(H) for purposes of the adjustment required by Section
5(h)(i) only, any Common Stock or Convertible Securities issued in any transaction in which exemption
from the adjustment required pursuant to Section 5(h)(i) hereof is approved by (1) the holders of at least
sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the outstanding Series Preferred and (2) the holders of a

117073370 v5
References to Common Stock in the subsections of this clause (v) above shall mean all
shares of Common Stock issued by the Company or deemed to be issued pursuant to this Section 5(h).
The “Effective Price” of Additional Shares of Common Stock shall mean the quotient determined by
dividing the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock issued or sold, or deemed to have been
issued or sold by the Company under this Section S(h), into the Aggregate Consideration received, or
deemed to have been received by the Company for such issue under this Section 5(h), for such Additional
Shares of Common Stock.

In the event that the Company issues or sells, or is deemed to have issued or sold,
Additional Shares of Common Stock in a Qualifying Additional Issuance (the “First Additional
Issuance”), then in the event that the Company issues or sells, or is deemed to have issued or sold,
Additional Shares of Common Stock in a Qualifying Additional Issuance other than the First Additional
Issuance pursuant to the same instruments as the First Additional Issuance (a “Subsequent Additional
Issuance”), then and in each such case upon a Subsequent Additional Issuance the applicable Series
Preferred Conversion Price shall be reduced to Series Preferred Conversion Price that would have been in
effect had the First Additional Issuance and each Subsequent Additional Issuance all occurred on the
closing date of the First Additional Issuance.

(vi) No adjustment shall be made to any Series Preferred Conversion
Price as the result of the issuance or deemed issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock if the
Company receives written notice from (A) the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66
2/3%) of the outstanding Series Preferred and (B) the holders of a majority of the outstanding Series F
Preferred Stock agreeing that no such adjustment shall be made as the result of the issuance or deemed
issuance of such Additional Shares of Common Stock.

(i) Certificate of Adjustment. In each case of an adjustment or
readjustment of any Series Preferred Conversion Price for the number of shares of Common Stock or
other securities issuable upon conversion of any series of Series Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock,
if such Series Preferred or Series E-| Preferred Stock is then convertible pursuant to this Section 5, the
Company, at its expense, shall compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the
provisions hereof and prepare a certificate showing such adjustment or readjustment, and shall mail such
certificate, by first class mail, postage prepaid, to each registered holder of such series of Series Preferred
or Series E-1 Preferred Stock at the holder’s address as shown in the Company’s books. The certificate
shall set forth such adjustment or readjustment, showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or
readjustment is based, including a statement of (i) the consideration received or deemed to be received by
the Company for any Additional Shares of Common Stock issued or sold or deemed to have been issued
or sold, (ii) the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price at the time in effect, (iii) the number of
Additional Shares of Common Stock and (iv) the type and amount, if any, of other property which at the
time would be received upon conversion of such Series Preferred or Series E-! Preferred Stock.

(j) Notices of Record Date. Upon (i) any taking by the Company of a
record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof who are
entitled to receive any dividend or other distribution, or (ii) any Acquisition (as defined in Section 4) or
other capital reorganization of the Company, any reclassification or recapitalization of the capital stock of
the Company, any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into any other corporation, or any
Asset Transfer (as defined in Section 4), or any voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or
winding up of the Company, the Company shall mail to each holder of Series Preferred and Series E-1
Preferred Stock at least ten (10) days prior to the record date specified therein (or such shorter period
approved by the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the outstanding Series
Preferred) a notice specifying (A) the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such
dividend or distribution and a description of such dividend or distribution, (B) the date on which any such
Acquisition, reorganization, reclassification, transfer, consolidation, merger, Asset Transfer, dissolution,
liquidation or winding up is expected to become effective, and (C) the date, if any, that is to be fixed as to
when the holders of record of Common Stock (or other securities) shall be entitled to exchange their

Acquisition, reorganization, reclassification, transfer, consolidation, merger, Asset Transfer, dissolution,
liquidation or winding up.

(k) Automatic Conversion.

(i) Each share of Series Preferred and Series E-1 Preferred Stock
shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock, based on the then-effective applicable
Series Preferred Conversion Price, (A) (1) in the case of Series G Preferred Stock, Series E-1 Preferred
Stock, Series E Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock and Junior Preferred, at any time upon the
affirmative election of the holders of at Jeast sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the then
outstanding shares of Series G Preferred Stock, Series E-1 Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock,
Series D Preferred Stock and Junior Preferred, voting together as a single class on an as-if-converted
basis, provided however that if such conversion is not effective and conditioned upon the closing of a
public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, covering the offer and sale of Common Stock for the account of the Company (an “IPO”), then,
in the case of Series G Preferred Stock, a separate affirmative election of the holders of at least sixty-six
and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the then outstanding shares of Series G Preferred Stock is required
prior to the conversion of the Series G Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 5(k)(i)(A)(1) and (2) in the
case of Series F Preferred Stock, at any time upon the affirmative election of the holders of a majority of
the then outstanding shares of Series F Preferred Stock, or (B) immediately upon the closing of a firmly
underwritten IPO in which: (1) the per share price to the public is at least $3.53598 (as adjusted for stock
splits, dividends, recapitalizations and the like after the filing date hereof); (2) the aggregate net cash
proceeds to the Company (after underwriting discounts, commissions and fees) are at least $50,000,000;
and (3) the Company’s Common Stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq Stock
Market. Upon such automatic conversion, any declared and unpaid dividends shall be paid in accordance
with the provisions of Section 5(d).

(ii) Upon the occurrence of any of the events specified in Section
5(k)(i) above, the outstanding shares of Series Preferred and Series E-1 Preferred Stock shall be converted
automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates
representing such shares are surrendered to the Company or its transfer agent; provided, however, that the
Company shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable
upon such conversion unless the certificates evidencing such shares of Series Preferred or Series E-1
Preferred Stock are either delivered to the Company or its transfer agent as provided below, or the holder
notifies the Company or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and
executes an agreement satisfactory to the Company to indemnify the Company from any loss incurred by
it in connection with such certificates. Upon the occurrence of such automatic conversion of Series
Preferred and Series E-] Preferred Stock, the holders of Series Preferred and Series E-] Preferred Stock
shall surrender the certificates representing such shares at the office of the Company or any transfer agent
for Series Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock. Thereupon, there shall be issued and delivered to such
holder promptly at such office and in its name as shown on such surrendered certificate or certificates, a
certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Series
Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock surrendered were convertible on the date on which such automatic
conversion occurred, and any declared and unpaid dividends shall be paid in accordance with the
provisions of Section 5(d).

(1) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be
issued upon conversion of Series Preferred or Series E-] Preferred Stock. All shares of Common Stock
(including fractions thereof) issuable upon conversion of more than one share of Series Preferred or
Series E-1 Preferred Stock by a holder thereof shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether
the conversion would result in the issuance of any fractional share. If, after the aforementioned
aggregation, the conversion would result in the issuance of any fractional share, the Company shall, in

17.
ACTIVE/82650060.4 120193-242355
117073370 v5
lieu of issuing any fractional share, pay cash equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by the
Common Stock’s fair market value (as determined by the Board) on the date of conversion.

(m) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Company shall
at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock, solely
for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of Series Preferred and Series E-1 Preferred
Stock, such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding shares of Series Preferred and Series E-1 Preferred Stock. If at any time the
number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shal] not be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all then outstanding shares of Series Preferred and Series E-! Preferred Stock, the Company
will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such

purpose.

(n) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Section 5 shall be
in writing and shall be deemed effectively given: (1) upon personal delivery to the party to be notified, (ii)
when sent by confirmed electronic mail or facsimile if sent during normal business hours of the recipient;
if not, then on the next business day, (iii) five (5) days after having been sent by registered or certified
mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or (iv) one (1) day after deposit with a nationally
recognized overnight courier, specifying next day delivery, with verification of receipt. All notices shall
be addressed to each holder of record at the address of such holder appearing on the books of the
Company.

(0) Payment of Taxes. The Company will pay all taxes (other than taxes
based upon income) and other governmental charges that may be imposed with respect to the issue or
delivery of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of shares of Series Preferred or Series E-1
Preferred Stock, excluding any tax or other charge imposed in connection with any transfer involved in
the issue and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in which the shares of Series
Preferred or Series E-] Preferred Stock so converted were registered.

6. NO REISSUANCE OF SERIES PREFERRED.

No shares or shares of Series Preferred or Series E-! Preferred Stock acquired by the
Company by reason of redemption, purchase, conversion or otherwise shall be reissued.

V.

A. The liability of the directors of the Company for monetary damages shall be eliminated to
the fullest extent under applicable law. If the DGCL is amended after approval by the stockholders of this
Article V to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors,
then the liability of a director of the Company shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted
by the DGCL as so amended.

B. The Company is authorized to provide indemnification of agents (as defined in Section
317 of the CGCL and, as the case may be, other applicable) for breach of duty to the Company and its
stockholders through bylaw provisions or through agreements with the agents, or through stockholder
resolutions, or otherwise, in excess of the indemnification and advancement otherwise permitted by
Section 317 of the CGCL and Section 145 of the DGCL, subject, at any time or times that the Company is
subject to Section 2115(b) of the CGCL, to the limits on such excess indemnification set forth in Section
204 of the CGCL.

Cc. Any repeal or modification of this Article V shall only be prospective and shall not affect
the rights under this Article V in effect at the time of the alleged occurrence of any action or omission to
act giving rise to liability.

amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Company; provided however, that, in addition to any vote of the
holders of any class or series of stock of the Company required by law or by this Certificate of
Incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all of the
then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to adopt, amend or repeal any provision of
the Bylaws of the Company.

VII.

In the event that a director of the Company who is also a partner or employee of an entity that is a
holder of Series Preferred and that is in the business of investing and reinvesting in other entities (each, a
“Fund”) acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter in such person’s capacity as a partner or
employee of the Fund and that may be a corporate opportunity for both the Company and such Fund (a
“Corporate Opportunity”), then the Company, to the fullest extent permitted by law, renounces any
interest or expectancy of the Company in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, the
Corporate Opportunity; provided, however, that such director acts in good faith and such Corporate
Opportunity was not offered to such person in his or her capacity as a director of the Company.
