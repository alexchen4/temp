2.3. Preferred Stock.
2.3.1 Series A Preferred Stock

One series of Preferred Stock shall be designated “Series A Preferred Stock," and
shall consist of 5,874,674 shares. The rights, preferences, restrictions and other matters
relating to the Series A Preferred Stock (the "Series A Stock”) are as foliows:

(a) Dividends. Subject to the sights of series of Preferred Stock which
may from time to time come into existence, the holders of shares of the Series A Stock
shall be entitled to receive dividends, out of any assets of the corporation legally available
therefor, prior and in preference to any declaration .* payment of any dividend (payable

other than in Common Stock of the corporation) on the Common Stock of the corporation
during any fiscal year, at the rate of eight percent (8%) of the Series A Original Issue
Price (as defined below) per annum per share of Series A Stock then outstanding, payable
when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors. After payment of such dividends to
the holders of the Series A Stock (and of any other class or series of Preferred Stock
having preferential rights as to dividends) in any fiscal car, the corporation may in the
same fiscal year declare or pay a dividend on Common Stock, provided the corporation
shall simultaneously declare and pay a dividend on each outstanding share of Series A
Stock that is equal or greater to the dividend to be declared or paid on each share of
Common Stock times the number of shares of Common Stock into which each such share
of Series A Stock is then convertible. No dividend shall be declared or paid on the
Common Stock, nor shall any distribution in respect of any shares of the Common Stock
otherwise be made, unless approved by a majority of the members of the Board of
Directors the holders of the Series A Stock shall have the right to designate pursuant to a
voting or other written agreement with the corporation. The right to dividends on the
Series A Stock shall not be cumulative, and no right shall accrue to the holders of the

receive an amount equal to the result of multiplying (1) $0.383 (the “Series A Original
Issue Price") (appropriately adjusted for any stock dividend, split, combination or similar
reorganization of the Series A Stock) by (2) 1.75, for each outstanding share of Series A
Stock held by them, and, in addition, an amount equal to any dividends declared but not
paid on each such share. If such assets available for distribution shall be insufficient to
permit the payment to the holders of Series A Stock of the preferential amounts to which
they may be entitled under this Section 2.3.1(b)(i), then, subject to the rights of series of
Preferred Stock which may from time to time come into existence, the entire assets of the
corporation legally available for distribution shall be distributed ratably among the
holders of shares of Series A Stock based upon the number of shares of such siuck held
by each of such holders.

(ii) | Upon the completion of the distributions required by
Section 2.3.1(b\i) above. subject to the rights of series of Preferred Stock which may
from time to time come into existence, the remaining assets of the corporation available

each (assuming full conversion of all Series A Stock at the Series A Conversion Rate
(determined under Section 2.3.3(b)) then in effect).

related transactions shall own securities representing less than a majority of the voting

transactions, or a sale, conveyance or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of
the corporation whether on a cunsolidated basis or otherwise, or the license or sublicense
(in each case on an exclusive basis), sale, conveyance or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the corporation’s intellectual property, shall be deemed to be a
liquidation, dissolution or winding up within the meaning of Section 2.5.1(b).

(4) Distributions to Shareholders. The Board of Directors’ right to
authorize and make distributions to its shareholders is subject to the restrictions set forth
in these Articles and the restrictions set forth in ORS 60.181 and such other applicable
legal restrictions as are or may hereafter become effective.

holder of the shares of Series A Stock being converted, or on its written order, such
certificate or certificates as it may request for the number of whole shares of Common
Stock issuable upon the conversion of such shares of Series A Stock in accordance with
the provisions of this Section 2.3.3, and cash in the amount of any declared and unpaid
dividends on such shares of Series A Siock up to and including the Conversion Date.

issuable upon such conversion shall be deemed to have become the holder or holders of
record of the shares of Common Stock represented thereby. If the conversion is in
connection with an underwritten offering of securities registered pursuant to the
Securities Act, the conversion (and payment of any declared and unpaid dividends) shall
be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of shares of Common
Stock pursuant to such offering, in which event the person(s) entitled to receive the
Common Stock upon conversion of the Series A Stock shall not be deemed to have
converted such securities until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities.

(i) | No Fractional Shares. No fractional shares shall be issued upon the
conversion of Series A Stock, and the uumber of shares of Common Stock to be issued
shall be rounded te the nearest whole share (with one-half being rounded upward),

the time converting into Common Stock and the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon such aggregate conversion.

(j)  Partis! Conversion. In the event some, but not all, of the shares of
Series A Stock represented by a certificate or certificates surrendered by a holder are
converted, the corporation shall execute and deliver to or on the order of the holder, at the
expense of the corporation, a new certificate representing the shares of Series A Stock
that were not converted.

(k) Reservation of Common Stock. The corporation shall at all times
reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued stares of Common Stock,
solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Series A Stock, such
number of its shares of Common Stock as shal] from time to time be sufficient to effect
the conversion of all outstanding shares of the Series A Stock and, if at any time the
