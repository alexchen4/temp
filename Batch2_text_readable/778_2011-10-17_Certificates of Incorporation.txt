Corporation, the holders of the Common Stock of the Corporation shall receive all of such
remaining assets of the Corporation pro rata based on the number of shares of Common Stock
held by each such holder.

(c) Certain Acquisitions.
(i) Deemed Liquidation.

(A) _ For purposes of this Section 2, a liquidation,
dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation shall be deemed to occur if (i) the Corporation
shall sell, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its property or business; or (ii)
the Corporation shall merge with or into or consolidate with any other corporation, limited
liability company or other entity (other than a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation); or
(iii) upon a sale or transfer of 50% or more of the voting securities of the Corporation in a
transaction or a series of expressly related transactions that has or have been expressly approved
by the Board of Directors (any transaction described in (i), (ii), or (iii), a “Liquidation
Transaction”), provided that none of the following shall be considered a Liquidation Transaction:
(i) a merger effected exclusively for the purpose of changing the domicile of the Corporation, (ii)
an equity financing in which the Corporation is the surviving corporation, or (iii) a transaction in
which the stockholders of the Corporation immediately prior to the transaction own 50% or more
of the voting securities of the surviving corporation following the transaction (on an as converted
basis). In the event of a merger or consolidation of the Corporation that is deemed pursuant to

OHS WEST:261356132.5 3
this section to be a Liquidation Transaction, all references in this Section 2 to “assets of the
Corporation” shall be deemed instead to refer to the aggregate consideration to be paid to the
holders of the Corporation’s capital stock in such merger or consolidation. Nothing in this
subsection 2(c)(i) shall require the distribution to stockholders of anything other than proceeds of
such transaction in the event of a merger or consolidation of the Corporation. In the event that
the Corporation is a party to a Liquidation Transaction, then each holder of Preferred Stock shall
be entitled to receive, for each share of Preferred Stock then held, out of the proceeds of such
Liquidation Transaction, the greater of (i) the amount of cash, securities or other property to
which such holder would be entitled to receive in a Liquidation Event pursuant to Section 2(a)
and Section 2(b) above or (ii) the amount of cash, securities or other property to which such
holder would be entitled to receive in a Liquidation Transaction with respect to such shares if
such shares had been converted to Common Stock immediately prior to such Liquidation
Transaction.

(B) ‘In the event of a Liquidation Transaction, if any
portion of consideration payable to the stockholders of the Corporation is placed into escrow or
is payable to the stockholders of the Corporation subject to contingencies, the agreement or plan
governing such Liquidation Transaction shall provide that: (i) the portion of such consideration
that is not placed in escrow and is not subject to any contingencies (the “Initial Consideration”)
shall be allocated among the holders of capital stock of the Corporation in accordance with
Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above as if the Initial Consideration were the only consideration payable
in connection with such Liquidation Transaction and (ii) any additional consideration which
becomes payable to the stockholders of the Corporation upon release from escrow or satisfaction
of contingencies shall be allocated, after taking into account the previous payment of the Initial
Consideration as part of the same transaction, among the holders of capital stock of the
Corporation in accordance with Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above.

(ii) Valuation of Consideration. In the event of a Liquidation
Transaction as described in Section 2(c)(i) above, if the consideration received by the
Corporation is other than cash, its value will be deemed its fair market value. Any securities
shall be valued as follows:

(A) — Securities not subject to investment letter or other
similar restrictions on free marketability:

(1) If traded on a national securities exchange or
The NASDAQ Global Market (“NASDAQ”), the value shall be deemed to be the average of the
closing prices of the securities on such national exchange or NASDAQ over the ten (10) trading
day period ending three (3) trading days prior to the closing of the Liquidation Transaction;

(2) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value
shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sales prices (whichever is applicable) of
the securities over the twenty (20) trading day period ending three (3) trading days prior to the
closing of the Liquidation Transaction; and ;

(3) If there is no active public market, the value
shall be the fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors,

OHS WEST:261356132.5 4
(B) The method of valuation of securities subject to
investment letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely
by virtue of a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an
appropriate discount from the market value determined as specified above in Section 2(c)(ii)(A)
to reflect the approximate fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors.

(C) The foregoing methods for valuing non-cash
consideration to be distributed in connection with a Liquidation Transaction shail be superseded
by any determination of such value set forth in the definitive agreements governing such
Liquidation Transaction.

(iii) Notice of Liquidation Transaction. The Corporation
shall give each holder of record of Preferred Stock written notice of any impending Liquidation

Transaction not later than 10 days prior to the stockholders’ meeting called to approve such
Liquidation Transaction, or 10 days prior to the closing of such Liquidation Transaction,
whichever is earlier, and shall also notify such holders in writing of the final approval of such
Liquidation Transaction, The first of such notices shall describe the material terms and
conditions of the impending Liquidation Transaction and the provisions of this Section 2, and the
Corporation shall thereafter give such holders prompt notice of any material changes. Unless
such notice requirements are waived, the Liquidation Transaction shall not take place sooner
than 10 days after the Corporation has given the first notice provided for herein or sooner than 10
days after the Corporation has given notice of any material changes provided for herein.
Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Restated Certificate, all notice periods or
requirements in this Restated Certificate may be shortened or waived, either before or after the
action for which notice is required, upon the written consent of the holders of at least sixty-five
percent (65%) of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (voting as a separate class on an as-if
converted to Common Stock basis) that are entitled to such notice rights.

(iv) Effect of Noncompliance. In the event the requirements of
this Section 2(c) are not complied with, the Corporation shall forthwith either cause the closing
of the Liquidation Transaction to be postponed until the requirements of this Section 2 have been
complied with, or cancel such Liquidation Transaction, in which event the rights, preferences,
privileges and restrictions of the holders of Preferred Stock shall revert to and be the same as
such rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions existing immediately prior to the date of the
first notice referred to in Section 2(c)(iii).

(v) Waiver of Liquidation Preference. The holders of at
least sixty-five percent (65%) of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock voting together
as a class (on an as converted to Common Stock basis) may by vote or written consent waive all
of the rights of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C
Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock set forth in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above. In the
event of such waiver, upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, either
voluntary or involuntary, the holders of the Common Stock of the Corporation shall receive all of
the assets of the Corporation available for distribution pro rata based on the number of shares of
Common Stock held by each such holder.

OHS WEST:261356132.5 5
3. Redemption. The Preferred Stock is not redeemable at the option of the
holder thereof.

4, Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion
rights as follows:

(a) Right to Conyert. Subject to Section 4(b), each share of Preferred
Stock shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of
issuance of such share, at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for such stock, into
such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by
dividing (i) $0.53750 in the case of the Series A Preferred Stock, (ii) $1.00000 in the case of
Series B Preferred Stock, (iii) $1.67105 in the case of Series C Preferred Stock, (iv) $0.0694 in
the case of Series D Preferred Stock, and (v) $0.1076 in the case of Series A-1 Preferred Stock
by the Conversion Price applicable to such share (the conversion rate for each such series of
Preferred Stock into Common Stock is referred to herein as the “Conversion Rate”), determined
as hereafter provided, in effect on the date the certificate is surrendered for conversion. The
initial Conversion Price per share shall be $0.2778 for Series A Preferred Stock, $0.4838 for
Series B Preferred Stock, $0.7826 for Series C Preferred Stock, $0.0694 for Series D Preferred
Stock, and $0.1076 for Series A-1 Preferred Stock. Each such initial Conversion Price shall be
subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 4(d).

(b) Automatic Conyersion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall
automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Rate at the time in
effect for such series of Preferred Stock immediately upon the earlier of (i) except as provided
below in Section 4(c), the Corporation’s sale of its Common Stock in a firm commitment
underwritten public offering pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), the public offering price of which is not less than $3.00
per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reclassification, and the like) and which
results in aggregate cash proceeds to the Corporation of not less than $25,000,000 (net of
underwriting discounts and commissions) (a “Qualified IPO”) or (ii) the date specified by written
consent or agreement of the holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding shares of Preferred
Stock, voting together as a class (on an as converted to Common Stock basis).

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall
be entitled to convert such Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, the holder shall
surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed (or a reasonably acceptable
affidavit and indemnity undertaking in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate), at the
office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for such series of Preferred Stock, and shall
give written notice to the Corporation at its principal corporate office, of the election to convert
the same and shall state therein the name or names in which the certificate or certificates for
shares of Common Stock are to be issued. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable
thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or
nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock
to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid and shall promptly pay in cash or, to the extent
sufficient funds are not then legally available therefor, in Common Stock (at the Common
Stock’s fair market value determined by the Board as of the date of such conversion), any
declared and unpaid dividends on the shares of Preferred Stock being converted. Such

OHS WEST:261356132.5 6
conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the
date of such surrender of the shares of such series of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the
person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion
shalt be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock
as of such date. If the conversion is in connection with a Qualified IPO or any other
underwritten public offering of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act the conversion
may, at the option of any holder tendering such Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned
upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering, in
which event any persons entitled to receive Common Stock upon conversion of such Preferred
Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the
closing of such sale of securities. If the conversion is effected by written consent or agreement
of the holders of Preferred Stock, such conversion shall be deemed to have been made on the
date specified by the written consent or agreement of such holders. Upon an automatic
conversion pursuant to Section 4(b) above, the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be
converted automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or
not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer
agent; provided however, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates
evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion unless either the
certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are delivered to the Corporation or its
transfer agent as provided above, or the holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that
such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the
Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against any loss incurred by it in connection with such
certificates. The Corporation shall then promptly pay in cash or, to the extent sufficient funds are
not then legally available therefor, in Common Stock (at the Common Stock’s fair market value
determined by the Board as of the date of such conversion), any declared and unpaid dividends
on the shares of Preferred Stock being converted.

(d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock for Certain
Dilutive Issuances, Splits and Combinations. The Conversion Price of the Series A Preferred
Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock, the Series C Preferred Stock, the Series D Preferred Stock,
and the Series A-1 Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

(i) Issuance of Additional Stock below Purchase Price. If
the Corporation should issue, at any time after the date upon which the first share of Series A-1
Preferred Stock was first issued (the “Purchase Date”), any Additional Stock (as defined below)
without consideration or for a consideration per share less than (A) in the case of the Series A
Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock, the Series C Preferred Stock and the Series D
Preferred Stock, the Conversion Price for the Series D Preferred Stock and (b) in the case of the
Series A-1 Preferred Stock, the Conversion Price for the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, in each
case, as applicable and in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock, the
Conversion Price for each series in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall
automatically be adjusted as set forth in this Section 4(d)(i), unless otherwise provided in this
Section 4(d)(i).

(A) Adjustment Formula. Whenever the Conversion

Price each series of Preferred Stock is adjusted pursuant to this Section (4)(d)(i), the new
Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock shall be determined by multiplying the

OHS WEST:261356132.5 7
Conversion Price of such series then in effect by a fraction, (x) the numerator of which shall be
the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance (the
“Outstanding Common”) plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate
consideration would purchase at (i) the Series D Conversion Price, in the case of the Series A
Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock, the Series C Preferred Stock and the Series D
Preferred Stock, or (ii) the Series A-1 Conversion Price} in the case of Series A-1 Preferred
Stock; and (y) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Outstanding Common
plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock. For purposes of the foregoing calculation,
the number of shares of Outstanding Common as of a given date shall be the sum of (A) the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such date, (B) the number of shares of
Common Stock into which the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock could be converted if
fully converted on the day immediately preceding the given date, and (C) the number of shares
of Common Stock which are issuable upon the exercise or conversion of all other rights, options
and convertible securities outstanding on the day immediately preceding the given date.

(B) Definition of “Additional Stock”. For purposes of
this Section 4(d)(i), “Additional Stock” shal] mean any shares of Common Stock issued (or
deemed to have been issued pursuant to Section AOE) by the Corporation after the Purchase
Date other than:

(1) Common Stock issued pursuant to stock
dividends, stock splits, or similar transactions, as described in Section 4(d)(ii) hereof;

(2) Shares of Common Stock issued or issuable
after the filing date of this Restated Certificate (the “Filing Date’) to employees, consultants, or
directors of the Corporation directly or pursuant to a stock option plan or restricted stock plan
approved by the Board of Directors for the primary purpose of soliciting or retaining their
services, provided, however, that the total number of shares Common Stock excluded from the
definition of Additional Stock by this subsection (d)(i)(B)(2) shall not exceed, in the aggregate,
39,507,002 shares (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reclassification, and the like),
unless a higher maximum number of shares is approved by the holders of at least sixty-five
percent (65%) of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a class (on an
as converted to Common Stock basis); provided, however, that such amount shall be increased to
reflect any shares of Common Stock (i) not issued pursuant to the rights, agreements, option or
warrants granted after the Filing Date (“Unexercised Options”) as a result of the termination of
such Unexercised Options or (ii) reacquired by the Corporation from employees, directors or
consultants at cost (or the lesser of cost or fair market value) pursuant to agreements which
permit the Corporation to repurchase such shares upon termination of services to the
Corporation;

(3) Capital stock, or options or warrants to
purchase capital stock, issued to financial institutions or lessors in connection with commercial
credit arrangements, equipment financings, commercial property lease transactions or similar
transactions the terms of which are approved by the Board of Directors (each, a “Financial
Issuance”), so long as the number of shares of capital stock issued, or issuable upon conversion
of such options or warrants, does not, in the aggregate, exceed that number of shares which is
equal to one half of one percent (0.5%) of the sum of (x) the total number of shares of

OHS WEST:261356)32.5 8
Outstanding Common plus (y) the total number of shares of Common Stock authorized but
unissued under the Corporation’s option plans, rounded up to the nearest whole share and
calculated as of the date of such Financial Issuance, unless a higher maximum number of shares
is approved by the holders of at least sixty-five percent (65%) of the then outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock, voting together as a class (on an as converted to Common Stock basis);

(4) Shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock
issuable upon exercise of options or warrants outstanding as of the Filing Date;

(5) Capital stock, or warrants or options to
purchase capital stock, issued i in connection with bona fide acquisitions, mergers or similar
transactions, the terms of which are approved by the Board of Directors and the holders of at
least sixty-five percent (65%) of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together
as a class (on an as converted to Common Stock basis);

(6) Shares of Common Stock actually issued or
issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock (including, without limitation, shares of
Common Stock issued in a conversion pursuant to Section 9(a) below),

(7) Shares of Common Stock issued or issuable
in a Qualified IPO;

(8) Capital stock issued or issuable to an entity
as a component of any business relationship with such entity for the purpose of (A) joint venture,
technology licensing or development activities, (B) distribution, supply or manufacture of the
Corporation’s products or services, or (C) any other arrangements involving corporate partners
that are primarily for purposes other than raising capital, the terms of which business relationship
(including the exclusion of such shares from the definition of “Additional Stock”) with such
entity are approved by the Board of Directors and the holders of at least sixty-five percent (65%)
of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a class (on an as converted
to Common Stock basis); or

(9) Shares of Common Stock issued or issuable
with the affirmative vote of at least sixty-five percent (65%) of the then outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock voting together as a class (on an as converted to Common Stock basis), and the
exclusion of which from the definition of “Additional Stock” is specifically so approved,

(C) NoFractional Adjustments, No adjustment of the
Conversion Price for the Preferred Stock shall be made in an amount less than one cent per share,
provided that any adjustments which are not required to be made by reason of this sentence shall
be carried forward and shall be either taken into account in any subsequent adjustment made
prior to three years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward,
or shall be made at the end of three years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment
being carried forward. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all such adjustments carried forward shall
be made immediately prior to the closing of a Liquidation Transaction or the liquidation,
dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation or upon conversion of the Preferred Stock,

OHS WEST:261356132.5 9
‘(D) Determination of Consideration. In the case of
the issuance of Additional Stock for cash, the consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of
cash paid therefor before deducting any reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses
allowed, paid or incurred by the Corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection
with the issuance and sale thereof. In the case of the issuance of the Additional Stock for a
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be
‘deemed to be the fair value thereof as determined by the Board of Directors irrespective of any
accounting treatment.

(E) Deemed Issuances of Common Stock, In the case
of the issuance (whether before, on or after the applicable Purchase Date) of securities or rights
convertible into, or entitling the holder thereof to receive directly or indirectly, additional shares
of Common Stock (the “Common Stock Equivalents”), the following provisions shall apply for
all purposes of this Section 4(d)(i):

(1) The aggregate maximum number of shares
of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion, exchange, or exercise (assuming the satisfaction
of any conditions to convertibility, exchangeability or exercisability, including, without
limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account potential antidilution |
adjustments) of any Common Stock Equivalents and subsequent conversion, exchange or
exercise thereof shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or
such Common Stock Equivalents were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration,
if any, received by the Corporation for any such securities and related Common Stock
Equivalents (excluding any cash received on account of accrued interest or accrued dividends),
plus the minimum additional consideration, if any, to be received by the Corporation (without
taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) upon the conversion, exchange, or
exercise of any Common Stock Equivalents (the consideration in each case to be determined in
the manner provided in Section 4(d)({i)(D)).

(2) In the event of any change in the number of
shares of Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon
conversion, exchange, or exercise of any Common Stock Equivalents, including a change
resulting from the antidilution provisions thereof, but excluding a change resulting from a
contemporaneous adjustment to a different series of Preferred Stock resulting from the
antidilution provisions thereof, the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock, to the
extent in any way affected by or computed using such Common Stock Equivalents, shall be
recomputed to reflect such change, but no further adjustment shall be made for the actual
issuance of Common Stock or any payment of such consideration upon the conversion, exchange

or exercise of such Common Stock Equivalents.

(3) | Upon the termination or expiration of the
convertibility, exchangeability, or exercisability of any Common Stock Equivalents, the
Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or
computed using such Common Stock Equivalents, shall be recomputed to reflect the issuance of
only the number of shares of Common Stock (and Common Stock Equivalents that remain
convertible, exchangeable or exercisable) actually issued upon the conversion, exchange, or
exercise of such Common Stock Equivalents.

OHS WEST:261356132.5 10
(4) The number of shares of Common Stock
deemed issued and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to Section 4(d)(i)(E)(1) shall
be appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination, or expiration of the type described
in either Section 4(d)(i)(E)(2) or 4(d)(i)(E)(3).

(F) No Increased Conversion Price. Notwithstanding
any other provisions of this Section (4)(d)(i), except to the limited extent provided for in Sections
4(d)(i)(E)(2) and 4(d)(i)(E)(3), no adjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section
4(d)(i) shall have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price above the Conversion Price in
effect immediately prior to such adjustment.

Gi) Stock Splits and Dividends. In the event the Corporation
should at any time after the Purchase Date fix a record date for the effectuation of a split or
subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (without a corresponding split or
subdivision of the outstanding Preferred Stock) or the determination of holders of Common
Stock entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of Common
Stock or Common Stock Equivalents without payment of any consideration by such holder for
the additional shares of Common Stock or the Common Stock Equivalents (including the
additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof) (without a
corresponding dividend or distribution to the outstanding Preferred Stock), then, as of such
record date (or the date of such dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no record date is
fixed), the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock shall be appropriately decreased so
that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series
shall be increased in proportion to such increase of the aggregate of shares of Common Stock
outstanding and those issuable with respect to such Common Stock Equivalents with the number
of shares issuable with respect to Common Stock Equivalents determined from time to time in
the manner provided for deemed issuances in Section 4(d)(i)(E).

(iii) Reverse Stock Splits. if the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding at any time after the Purchase Date is decreased by a combination of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock (without a corresponding combination of the outstanding
Preferred Stock), then, following the record date of such combination, the Conversion Price of
each series of Preferred Stock shall be appropriately increased so that the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be decreased i in
proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares.

(e) Other Distributions. In the event the Corporation shall declare a
distribution payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by the
Corporation or other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred
to in Section 4(d)(i) or 4(d)(ii), then, in each such case for the purpose of this Section 4(e), the
holders of each series of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any such
distribution as though they were the holders of the number of shares of Common Stock of the
Corporation into which their shares of Preferred Stock are convertible as of the record date fixed
for the determination of the holders of Common Stock of the Corporation entitled to receive such
distribution.

OHS WEST:261356132.5 11
(f) Recapitalizations. If at any time or from time to time there shall be a
recapitalization of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision, combination or merger or sale
of assets transaction provided for elsewhere in this Section 4 or in Section 2) provision shall be
made so that the holders of each series of Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive
upon conversion of such Preferred Stock the number of shares of stock or other securities or
property of the Corporation or otherwise, to which a holder of Common Stock deliverable upon
conversion would have been entitled on such recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate
adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 4 with respect to the
rights of the holders of such Preferred Stock after the recapitalization to the end that the
provisions of this Section 4 (including adjustment of the Conversion Price then in effect and the
number of shares purchasable upon conversion of such Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after
that event and be as nearly equivalent as practicable.

(g) No Fractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments.

(i) No fractional shares shal] be issued upon the conversion of
any share or shares of Preferred Stock, and the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued
shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share. The number of shares issuable upon such
conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock the
holder is at the time converting into Common Stock and the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon such aggregate conversion. If the conversion would result in any fractional share,
the Corporation shall, in lieu of issuing any such fractional share, pay the holder thereof an
amount in cash equal to the fair market value of such fractional share on the date of conversion,
as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(ii) | Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of
the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation,
at its expense, shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the
terms hereof and prepare and furnish to each holder of such Preferred Stock a certificate setting
forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such
adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon the written request at any time
of any holder of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate
setting forth (A) such adjustment and readjustment, (B) the Conversion Price for such series of
Preferred Stock at the time in effect, and (C) the number of shares of Common Stock and the
amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon the conversion of
such series of Preferred Stock.

(h) Notices of Record Date, In the event of any taking by the
Corporation of a record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining
the holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend) or other
distribution, any right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of stock of any
class or any other securities or property, or to receive any other right, the Corporation shall mail
to each holder of Preferred Stock, at least 10 days prior to the date specified therein, a notice
specifying the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend,
distribution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right.

shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common
Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock,
such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding shares of such series of Preferred Stock; and if at any time the
number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all then outstanding shares of such series of Preferred Stock, in addition to such
other remedies as shall be available to the holder of such Preferred Stock, the Corporation will
take such corporate action as ray, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient
for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite
stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to this Restated Certificate.

stockholder’s Pay-to-Play Conversion Percéntage (as hereafter defined) multiplied by the
number of shares of each series of Preferred Stock held by such stockholder shall, automatically
and without further action on the part of such holder, be converted, subject to and effective
immediately following the consummation of the Final Closing, into shares of Common Stock of

Qualified Financing.

OHS WEST:261356132.5 15
(b) Definitions.

(i) As used herein, “Final Closing” shall mean the date
determined by the Board of Directors of the Corporation to be the final date upon which shares
of Series A-1 Preferred Stock may be issued in a Qualified Financing,

(ii) As used herein, a stockholder's “Pay-to-Play Conversion
Percentage” shall mean one (1) minus the quotient obtained by dividing (a) the aggregate number
of shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock actually purchased by such stockholder in connection
with the Qualified Financing calculated immediately following the effectiveness of the Final
Closing, divided by (b) such stockholder’s Pro Rata Share (as defined below).

(iii) As used herein, a stockholder's “Pro Rata Share” is the
number of shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock equal to the product obtained by multiplying (a)
31,229,889 by (b) a fraction, where the numerator of such fraction is the aggregate number of
shares of Preferred Stock held by such stockholder immediately prior to the initial closing of the
Qualified Financing (on an as converted basis), and the denominator is the aggregate number of
shares of Preferred Stock which are outstanding immediately prior to the initial closing of the
Qualified Financing (on an as converted basis).

certificates representing the shares so converted, duly endorsed or assigned in blank or to the
Corporation. As promptly thereafter as is practicable, the Corporation shall issue and deliver to
such holder, at the place designated by such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of

date of the Final Closing, as the case may be. No fractional shares shall be issued upon the
conversion of any share or shares of a series of Preferred Stock, and the number of shares of
Common Stock to be issued shall be rounded to the nearest whole share. If the conversion would
result in any fractional share, the Corporation shall, in lieu of issuing any such fractional share,
pay the holder thereof an amount in cash equal to the fair market value of such fractional share
on the date of conversion, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

shares purchased by a holder, and for determining the number of shares of Preferred Stock
owned by a holder, all shares of Preferred Stock held by any affiliated venture capital funds,
pattnerships, limited liability companies, partners, members, and retired partners and members of
such holder, or the estates and family members of any such partners, members, and retired
partners and members and any trusts for the benefit of any of the foregoing persons, shall be

more than one entity or person within any such group of affiliated entities or persons.

(C) Common Stock.

1. Dividend Rights. Subject to the prior rights of holders of all classes of
stock at the time outstanding having prior rights as to dividends, the holders of the Common
