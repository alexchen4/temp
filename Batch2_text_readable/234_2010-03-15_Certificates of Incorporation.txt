2. Dividends.

(a) Preferred Stock. In any calendar year, the holders of outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock, on a pari passu basis, shall be entitled to receive dividends when, as and if declared
by the Board of Directors, out of any assets at the time legally available therefor, at the Dividend
Rate specified for the applicable series of Preferred Stock payable in preference and priority to any
declaration or payment of any Distribution on Common Stock of the Corporation in such calendar
year. No Distributions in any calendar year shall be made with respect to the Common Stock until
all dividends on the Preferred Stock required pursuant to the preceding sentence have been paid or
set aside for payment to the Preferred Stock holders. Declared but unpaid dividends with respect to
a share of Preferred Stock shall, upon conversion of such share into Common Stock, be paid to the
extent assets are legally available therefore either in cash or in Common Stock. The right to receive
dividends on shares of Preferred Stock shall not be cumulative, and no right to such dividends shall
accrue to holders of Preferred Stock by reason of the fact that dividends on said shares are not
declared or paid in any calendar year.

(b) Additional Dividends. After the payment or setting aside for payment of the
dividends described in Section 2(a) hereof, any additional dividends (other than dividends on
Common Stock payable solely in Common Stock) declared or paid in any fiscal year shall be
declared or paid among the holders of the Preferred Stock and Common Stock then outstanding in
proportion to the greatest whole number of shares of Common Stock which would be held by each
such holder if all shares of Preferred Stock were converted into Common Stock at the then-effective
Conversion Rate (as defined in Section 4 hereof).

(c) Non-Cash Distributions. Whenever a Distribution provided for in this
Section 2 shall be payable in property other than cash, the value of such Distribution shall be deemed
to be the fair market value of such property on the date of payment as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors.

(d) Consent to Certain Distributions. As authorized by Section 402.5(c) of the
California Corporations Code, if Section 502 or Section 503 of the California Corporations Code is
applicable to a payment made by the Corporation then such applicable section or sections shall not
apply if such payment is a payment made by the Corporation in connection with (i) repurchases of
Common Stock issued to or held by employees, officers, directors or consultants of the Corporation
or its subsidiaries upon termination of their employment or services pursuant to agreements
providing for the right of said repurchase, (11) repurchases of Common Stock issued to or held by
employees, officers, directors or consultants of the Corporation or its subsidiaries pursuant to rights
of first refusal contained in agreements providing for such right, (iii) repurchase of capital stock of
the Corporation in connection with the settlement of disputes with any stockholder, provided such

4976047
3. Liquidation Rights.

(a) Liquidation Preference. In the event of any Liquidation Event (as defined
below), the holders of Preferred Stock, on a pari passu basis, shall be entitled to receive prior and in
preference to any Distribution of any of the assets of the Corporation to the holders of the Common
Stock by reason of their ownership of such stock, an amount per share for each share of Preferred
Stock held by them equal to the sum of (i) the Liquidation Preference specified for the applicable
series of Preferred Stock and (ii) all declared but unpaid dividends (if any) on the applicable series of
Preferred Stock. If, upon the occurrence of such Liquidation Event, the assets of the Corporation
legally available for distribution to the holders of the Preferred Stock are insufficient to permit the
payment to such holders of the full amounts specified in this Section 3(a), then the entire assets of
the Corporation legally available for distribution shall be distributed ratably among the holders of the
Preferred Stock in proportion to the full amounts they would otherwise be entitled to receive
pursuant to this Section 3(a).

(b) Remaining Assets. After the payment to the holders of Preferred Stock of the
full preferential amounts specified above, the entire remaining assets of the Corporation legally
available for distribution by the Corporation shall be distributed with equa! priority and pro rata
among the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and Common Stock in proportion to the number
of shares of Common Stock held by them, with the shares of Series A Preferred Stock being treated
tor this purpose as if they had been converted to shares of Common Stock at the then applicable
Conversion Rate.

(c) Reorganization. For purposes of this Section 3, a “Liquidation Event” shall
be deemed to be occasioned by, or to include, (i) the consummation of the merger or consolidation
of the Corporation with or into another entity (except a merger or consolidation in which the holders
of outstanding capita! stock of this Corporation immediately prior to such merger or consolidation
continue to hold at least a majority of the voting power of the outstanding capital stock of this
Corporation or the surviving or acquiring entity), (ii) the closing of the transfer (whether by merger,
consolidation or otherwise), in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to a person or group
of affiliated persons (other than an underwriter of this Corporation’s securities), of this Corporation’s
outstanding securities if, immediately after such closing, such person or group of affiliated persons
would hold at least a majority of the outstanding voting power of the capital stock of this
Corporation, (iii) a sale, lease, exclusive license or other conveyance of all or substantially all of the
assets of the Corporation, or (iv) any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation,
whether voluntary or involuntary; provided, however, that a transaction shall not constitute a
Liquidation Event if its sole purpose is to change the state or jurisdiction of the Corporation’s
incorporation or to create a holding company that will be owned in substantially the same
proportions by the persons who held this Corporation’s securities immediately prior to such
transaction. Notwithstanding the prior sentence, the sale of shares of Preferred Stock in a financing
shall not be deemed a Liquidation Event.

(d) Valuation of Non-Cash Consideration. If any assets of the Corporation
distributed to stockholders in connection with any Liquidation Event are other than cash, then the
value of such assets shall be their fair market value as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors, including the consent of at least two (2) of the Preferred Directors (as defined herein),

4976047
except that any publicly-traded securities to be distributed to stockholders in a Liquidation Event
shall be valued as follows:

(i) _ If the securities are then traded on a national securities exchange or the
Nasdaq Stock Market (or a similar national quotation system), then the value of the securities shall
be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange or system over
the ten (10) trading day period ending five (5) trading days prior to the Distribution;

(ii) if the securities are actively traded over-the-counter, then the value of
the securities shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid prices of the securities over the ten
(10) trading day period ending five (5) trading days prior to the Distribution.

In the event of a merger or other acquisition of the Corporation by another entity, the
Distribution date shall be deemed to be the date such transaction closes.

For the purposes of this Section 3(d), “trading day” shall mean any day which the exchange
or system on which the securities to be distributed are traded is open and “closing prices” or
“closing bid prices” shal] be deemed to be: (i) for securities traded primarily on the New York
Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, the last reported trade price or sale price,
as the case may be, at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on that day and (ii) for securities listed or traded on
other exchanges, markets and systems, the market price as of the end of the regular hours trading
period that is generally accepted as such for such exchange, market or system. If, after the date
hereof, the benchmark times generally accepted in the securities industry for determining the market
price of a stock as of a given trading day shall change from those set forth above, the fair market
value shall be determined as of such other generally accepted benchmark times.

The foregoing methods for valuing non-cash consideration to be distributed in connection
with a Liquidation Event may be superceded by any determination of such value set forth in the
definitive agreements governing such Liquidation Event that have been approved by the Board of
Directors.

4, Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as
follows:

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the
option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share at the office of the
Corporation or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, into that number of fully-paid,
nonassessable shares of Common Stock determined by dividing the Original Issue Price for the
relevant series of Preferred Stock by the Conversion Price for such series. The number of shares of
Common Stock into which each share of Preferred Stock of a series may be converted is hereinafter
referred to as the “Conversion Rate” for each such series. Upon any decrease or increase in the
Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock, as described in this Section 4, the Conversion
Rate for such series shall be appropriately increased or decreased.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shal! automatically be
converted into fully-paid, non-assessable shares of Common Stock at the then effective Conversion
Rate for such share (i) immediately prior to the closing of a firm commitment underwritten initial
public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933,
4976047

-5-
as amended (the “Securities Act”), covering the offer and sale of the Corporation’s Common Stock,
provided that the aggregate gross proceeds to the Corporation equals or exceeds US$30,000,000,
(ii) with respect to the conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock only, upon the date specified
by written consent or agreement of the holders of at least seventy percent (70%) of the then
outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock (voting separately as a class), (iii) with respect to the
conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock only, upon the date specified by written consent or
agreement of the holders of at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the then outstanding shares of
Series B Preferred Stock (voting separately as a class) or (iv) with respect to the conversion of the
Series C Preferred Stock only, upon the date specified by written consent or agreement of the
holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock (each of the events
referred to in (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) are referred to herein as an “Automatic Conversion Event”).

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be
issued upon conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder
would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the
applicable Conversion Price. For such purpose, all shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder of
Preferred Stock shall be aggregated, and any resulting fractional share of Common Stock shall be
paid in cash. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into full
shares of Common Stock, and to receive certificates therefor, such holder shall either (i) surrender
the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any
transfer agent for the Preferred Stock or (ii) notify the Corporation or its transfer agent that such
certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and execute an agreement satisfactory to the
Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such
certificates, and shall give written notice to the Corporation at such office that such holder elects to
convert the same; provided, however, that on the date of an Automatic Conversion Event, the
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically without any further action by
the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates representing such shares are
surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent; provided further, however, that the Corporation
shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon
such Automatic Conversion Event unless either the certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred
Stock are delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent as provided above, or the holder notifies
the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and
executes an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss
incurred by it in connection with such certificates. On the date of the occurrence of an Automatic
Conversion Event, each holder of record of shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to be the
holder of record of the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, notwithstanding that the
certificates representing such shares of Preferred Stock shall not have been surrendered at the office
of the Corporation, that notice from the Corporation shall not have been received by any holder of
record of shares of Preferred Stock, or that the certificates evidencing such shares of Common Stock
shall not then be actually delivered to such holder.

The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after such delivery, or after such agreement and
indemnification, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as
aforesaid and, if applicable, a check payable to the holder in the amount of any cash amounts
payable as the result of a conversion into fractional shares of Common Stock, plus any declared and
unpaid dividends on the converted Preferred Stock. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been
4976047

Pa

-0-
made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of
Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common
Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders
of such shares of Common Stock on such date; provided, however, that if the conversion is in
connection with an underwritten offer of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act, a
Liquidation Event or a financing or other event, the conversion may, at the option of any holder
tendering Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing of such transaction or
upon the occurrence of such event, in which case the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion of the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such
Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such transaction or the occurrence of such
event.

(d) Adjustments to Conversion Price for Diluting Issues.

G) Special Definition. For purposes of this Section 4(d), “Additional
Shares of Common” shall mean all shares of Common Stock issued (or, pursuant to Section
4(d)(ii1) hereof, deemed to be issued) by the Corporation after the Original Issue Date, other than
shares of Common Stock (or Options or Convertible Securities) issued or issuable (or, pursuant to
Section 4(d)(iti) hereof, deemed to be issued or issuable):

(1) pursuant to that certain Series C Preferred Stock Purchase
Agreement by and among the Corporation and the additional parties named therein, dated as of the
Original Issue Date;

(2) upon conversion of Preferred Stock;

(3) upon exercise or conversion of Options or other arrangements
to purchase Common Stock issued from time to time to employees, officers, directors or consultants
of the Corporation pursuant to any plan or agreement approved by the Board of Directors;

(4) pursuant to Recapitalizations;

(5) upon exercise or conversion of Options, warrants, notes or
other Convertible Securities outstanding on the Original Issue Date;

(6) in a firm commitment underwritten public offering under the
Securities Act, or pursuant to the securities laws applicable to an offering in another jurisdiction
pursuant to which securities wil! be listed on an internationally-recognized securities exchange;

(7) pursuant to any bona fide business acquisition of or by the
Corporation, whether by merger, consolidation, sale of assets, sale or exchange of stock or
otherwise, which transaction is approved by the Board of Directors and holders of at least a majority
of the then outstanding Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class and on an as-converted
basis);

(8) in connection with licensing or intellectual property
transactions not related to the raising of capital by the Corporation; which transaction is approved by
either (i) the Board of Directors including the affirmative vote or consent of at least two (2)

4976047

-7-
Preferred Directors or (ii) holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding Preferred Stock
(voting together as a single class and on an as-converted basis); and

(9) pursuant to other transactions expressly excluded from the
definition of “Additional Shares of Common,” which transaction is approved by either (i) the Board
of Directors including the affirmative vote or consent of at least two (2) Preferred Directors or (11)
holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding Preferred Stock (voting together as a single
class and on an as-converted basis).

(ii) No Adjustment of Conversion Price. No adjustment in the Conversion
Price of a particular series of Preferred Stock shall be made in respect of the issuance of Additional
Shares of Common unless the consideration per share (as determined pursuant to Section 4(d)(v)
hereof) for an Additional Share of Common issued or deemed to be issued by the Corporation is less
than the Conversion Price in effect on the date of, and immediately prior to such issue, for such
series of Preferred Stock.

(iii) | Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall issue any Options or
Convertible Securities or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of
securities entitled to receive any such Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum number
of shares (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto without regard to any provisions contained
therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of
such Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities, the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities or, in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such
Options and the conversion or exchange of the underlying securities, shall be deemed to have been
issued as of the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close
of business on such record date, provided that in any such case in which shares are deemed to be
issued:

(1) no further adjustment in the Conversion Price of any series of
Preferred Stock shall be made upon the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities or shares of
Common Stock in connection with the exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities;

(2) if such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms
provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any change in the consideration payable to the
Corporation or in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or
exchange thereof (other than a change pursuant to the anti-dilution provisions of such Options or
Convertible Securities such as this Section 4(d) or pursuant to Recapitalization provisions of such
Options or Convertible Securities such as Sections 4(e), 4(f) and 4(g) hereof), the Conversion Price
of each series of Preferred Stock and any subsequent adjustments based thereon shall be recomputed
to reflect such change as if such change had been in effect as of the original issue thereof (or upon
the occurrence of the record date with respect thereto);

(3) no readjustment pursuant to clause (2) above shall have the
effect of increasing the Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock to an amount above the
Conversion Price that would have resulted from any other issuances of Additional Shares of

4976047

-8-
Common and any other adjustments provided for herein between the original adjustment date and
such readjustment date;

(4) upon the expiration of any such Options or any rights of
conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have been exercised, the
Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon
the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto) and any subsequent adjustments based thereon
shall, upon such expiration, be recomputed as if:

(a) in the case of Convertible Securities or Options for
Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common issued were the shares of Common Stock, if
any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities and the consideration received therefor was the consideration actually
received by the Corporation for the issue of such exercised Options plus the consideration actually
received by the Corporation upon such exercise or for the issue of all such Convertible Securities
which were actually converted or exchanged, plus the additional consideration, if any, actually
received by the Corporation upon such conversion or exchange, and

(b) in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, only
the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were issued at the time of
issue of such Options, and the consideration received by the Corporation for the Additional Shares of
Common deemed to have been then issued was the consideration actually received by the
Corporation for the issue of such exercised Options, plus the consideration deemed to have been
received by the Corporation (determined pursuant to Section 4(d)(v) hereof) upon the issue of the
Convertible Securities with respect to which such Options were actually exercised; and

(5) if such record date shall have been fixed and such Options or
Convertible Securities are not issued on the date fixed therefor, the adjustment previously made in
the Conversion Price which became effective on such record date shall be canceled as of the close of
business on such record date, and thereafter the Conversion Price shal! be adjusted pursuant to this
Section 4(d)(iii) as of the actual date of their issuance.

(iv) Adjustment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional Shares
of Common. In the event this Corporation shall, at any time after the Original Issue Date, issue

Additional Shares of Common (including Additional Shares of Common deemed to be issued
pursuant to Section 4(d)(iii) hereof) without consideration or for a consideration per share less than,
(A) with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock, the Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred
Stock in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such issue, or, (B) with respect to the Series B
Preferred Stock and the Series C Preferred Stock, the Conversion Price for the Series C Preferred
Stock in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such issue, then, the Conversion Price of the
affected series of Preferred Stock shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price
(calculated to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by, (AA) with
respect to the Series A Preferred Stock, a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of shares
which the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for the total number of Additional
Shares of Common so issued would purchase at such Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred
Stock, and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding

4976047

-9.
immediately prior to such issue plus the number of such Additional Shares of Common so issued or,
(BB) with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock and the Series C Preferred Stock, a fraction, the
numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior
to such issue plus the number of shares which the aggregate consideration received by the
Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of Common so issued would purchase at such
Conversion Price for the Series C Preferred Stock, and the denominator of which shall be the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of
such Additional Shares of Common so issued. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the applicable
Conversion Price shall not be reduced at such time if the amount of such reduction would be less
than US$0.01, but any such amount shall be carried forward, and a reduction will be made with
respect to such amount at the time of, and together with, any subsequent reduction which, together
with such amount and any other amounts so carried forward, equal US$0.01 or more in the
aggregate. For the purposes of this Section 4(d)(iv), all shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock and the exercise and/or conversion of any
other outstanding Convertible Securities and all outstanding Options shall be deemed to be
outstanding.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this Section 4(d), the
consideration received by the Corporation for the issue (or deemed issue) of any Additional Shares
of Common shall be computed as follows:

(1) Cash and Property. Such consideration shall:

(a) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
aggregate amount of cash received by the Corporation before deducting any reasonable discounts,
commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the Corporation for any underwriting or
otherwise in connection with such issuance;

(b) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair market value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors; and

(c) in the event Additional Shares of Common are issued
together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for consideration which
covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in clauses (a)
and (b) above, as reasonably determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(2) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per
share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common deemed to have been issued
pursuant to Section 4(d)(iii) hereof shall be determined by dividing

(x) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Corporation as
consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the minimum aggregate
amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to
any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration) payable to the
Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options for

Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities by
4976047

-10-
(y) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set forth in the
instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent
adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities.

(e) Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of Common Stock. In the
event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided (by stock split, by payment of a
stock dividend or otherwise), into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion
Price of each series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall,
concurrently with the effectiveness of such subdivision, be proportionately decreased. In the event
the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined (by reclassification or otherwise) into a
lesser number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Prices in effect immediately prior to such
combination shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination, be proportionately
increased.

Preferred Stock, the Dividend Rate, Original Issue Price and Liquidation Preference of the affected
series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall, concurrently with the
effectiveness of such subdivision, be proportionately decreased. In the event the outstanding shares
of Preferred Stock or a series of Preferred Stock shall be combined (by reclassification or otherwise)

changed into the same or a different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock, whether
by capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of
shares provided for above), then, in any such event, in lieu of the number of shares of Common
Stock which the holders would otherwise have been entitled to receive each holder of such Preferred
Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such shares of Preferred Stock into a number of
shares of such other class or classes of stock which a holder of the number of shares of Common
Stock deliverable upon conversion of such series of Preferred Stock immediately before that change
would have been entitled to receive in such reorganization or reclassification, all subject to further
adjustment as provided herein with respect to such other shares.

(h) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation at its expense shal]
promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish
to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and
showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation
shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be
furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and readjustments, (ii) the

amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon the conversion of

to the contrary, any downward adjustment of the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock
may be waived by the consent or vote of the holders of the majority of the outstanding shares of such
series either before or after the issuance causing the adjustment.

(j) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at all
times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock solely
for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock, such number of its
shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then
outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding
shares of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion
of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such
number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.
