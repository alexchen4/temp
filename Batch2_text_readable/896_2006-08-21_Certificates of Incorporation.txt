full day preceding the date fixed for the payment of any amounts distributable on liquidation to
the holders of Preferred Stock.

(b) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shalt be issued

‘upon conversion of the Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder

would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by
the then effective Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion.

Gi) In order for a holder of Preferred Stock to convert shares of
Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the certificate or
certificates for such shares of Preferred Stock, at the office of the transfer agent for the Preferred
Stock (or at the principal office of the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer
agent), together with written notice that such holder elects to convert all or any number of the
shares of Preferred Stock represented by such certificate or certificates. Such notice shall state
such holder's name or the names of the nominees in which such holder wishes the certificate or
certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued. If required by the Corporation, certificates
surrendered for conversion shail be endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or
instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered
holder or his or its attommey duly authorized in writing. The date of receipt of such certificates
and notice by the transfer agent (or by the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own
transfer agent) shall be the conversion date (“Conversion Date”). The Corporation shall, as soon
as practicable after the Conversion Date, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of
Preferred Stock, or to his or its nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of
Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled, together with cash in lieu of any fraction
of a share.

(ti) | The Corporation shall at all times when the Preferred Stock shall
be outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued stock, for the
purpose of effecting the conversion of the Preferred Stock, such number of its duly authorized
shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all
outstanding Preferred Stock. Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment
reducing the Series A Conversion Price, the Series B Conversion Price, the Series C Conversion
Price or the Series D Conversion Price below the then par value of the shares of Common Stock

10127168_5 . -l]-

AUG-21-2886 @9:29 MBBP 781 G22 5933 P.43

issuable upon conversion of such Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take any corporate action
which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Corporation may validly
and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock at such adjusted
Conversion Price. .

. (iii) | Upon any such conversion, no adjustment to any Conversion Price
shall be made for any declared but unpaid dividends on the Preferred Stock surrendered for
conversion or on the Common Stock delivered upon conversion.

; (iv) All shares of Preferred Stock which shall have been. surrendered

for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and ail rights with

. respect to such shares, including the rights, tf any, to receive notices and to vote, shall
immediately cease and terminate on the Conversion Date, except only the right of the holders
thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor and payment of any dividends
declared but unpaid thereon. Any shares of Preferred Stock so converted shall be retired and
cancelled and shall not be reissued, and the Corporation (without the need for stockholder action)
may from time to time take such appropriate action as may be necessary to reduce the authorized
number of shares of Preferred Stock accordingly.

(v} The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and other taxes that
may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon
conversion of shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4. The Corporation shall not,
however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in
the issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in which the
shares of Preferred Stock so converted were registered, and no such issuance or delivery shall be
made unless and until the person or entity requesting such issuance has paid to the Corporation
the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax
has been paid.

in the Conversion Price thereof: (a) unless the consideration per share (determined pursuant to
Subsection 4(d)(v)) for an Additional Share of Common Stock issued or deemed to be issued by
the Corporation is less than such Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the issue of
such Additional Shares, or (b) if prior to such issuance, the Corporation receives written notice
from the holders of at least 70% of the then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock,

(iii) Issue of Securities Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common

Stock.

If the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall
issue any Options (excluding Options covered by Subsection 4(d)(i)(D)(1) and (4) above) or
Convertible Securities (excluding Convertible Securities covered by Subsection 4(d)(i)(D)(1)
above) or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled
to receive any such Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of shares of
Common Stock (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto without regard to any provision
contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such
Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities and Options therefor, the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to be Additional Shares of Common
Stock issued as of the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as
of the close of business on such record date, provided that Additional Shares of Common Stock
shall not be deemed to have been issued unless the consideration per share (determined pursuant
to Subsection 4(d)(v) hereof) of such Additional Shares of Common Stock would be less than the
applicable Conversion Price in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such issue, or such
record date, as the case may be, and provided further that in any such case in which Additional
Shares of Common Stock are deemed to be issued:

(A) No further adjustment in the Conversion Price shal] be
made upon the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities or shares of Common Stock upon the
exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities; -

(B) If such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms
provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any increase or decrease in the consideration
payable to the Corporation, upon the exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, the Conversion
Price computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with
respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon any such increase or
decrease becoming effective, be recomputed to reflect such increase or decrease insofar as it
affects such Options or the rights of conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities;

(C) Upon the expiration or termination of any unexercised
Option, the affected Conversion Price shall be readjusted to the Conversion Price that would be
in effect had such Option never been issued, and the Additional Shares of Common Stock
deemed issued as the result of the original issue of such Option shall not be deemed issued for
the purposes of any subsequent adjustment of the affected Conversion Price;

(D) In the event of any change in the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any such Option or
Convertible Security, including, but not limited to, a change resulting from the anti-~dilution
provisions thereof (but excluding any change resulting from any events resulting in changes
under Section 4(c) or 4(f) below), the Conversion Price then in effect shall forthwith be
readjusted to such Conversion Price as would have obtained had the adjustment which was made
upon the issuance of such Option or Convertible Security not exercised or converted prior to such
change been made upon the basis of such change; and

10127168_5 -]4-
'.. AuG-

21-2086 99:29 MBBP 781 622 5933

{E) No readjustment pursuant to clause (B), (C) or (D) above
shall have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price to an amount which exceeds the lower of

(4) the Conversion Price on the original adjustment date, or (ii) the Conversion Price that would

have resulted from any issuances of Additional Shares of Common Stock between the original
adjustment date and such readjustment date.

In the event the Corporation, after the Original Issue Date, amends the terms of any such
Options or Convertible Securities (whether such Options or Convertible Securities were
outstanding on the Original Issue Date or were issued after the Original Issue Date), then such
Options or Convertible Securities, as so amended, shall be deemed to have been issued after the
Original Issue Date and the provisions of this Subsection 4(d)(iii) shall apply.

(iv) Adjustment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional

Shares of Common Stock.

(A) Inthe event the Corporation shall, at any time after the

Onginal Issue Date and on or before the earlier of (i) the two year anniversary of the Original
Issue Date and (ii) the date of the next financing of the Company in which the Company receives
aggregate gross proceeds of more than $5,000,000, (the earlier of the events described in (i) and
(ii) shall be referred to as the "Determination Date"), issue Additional Shares of Common Stock
(including Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to Subsection
4(d)(iii), but excluding shares issued as a stock split or combination,as.prowided in Section 4(e)
or upon-a-dividendordistribution as provided in Section 4(f)),aWithout cons
consideration per share less tian the applicable Series D Conversion Price

issu; then the Series D Conversion Price shall be reduced?ec

Pee ‘
ise, to the consideration per share received by the Corporation for suctPissue-orMeemed issue

of the Additional Shares of Common Stock; provided that if such issuance or deemed issuance
was without consideration, then the Corporation shall be deemed to have received an aggregate
of $0.01 of consideration for all such Additional Shares of Common Stock issued or deemed to
be issued. :

(B) _ In the event the Corporation shall, with respect to the Prior
Preferred at any time after the Original Issue Date, or with respect to the Series D Preferred Stock
at any time after the Determination Date, issue Additional Shares of Common Stock (including
Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to Subsection 4(d) (ii), but
excluding shares issued as a stock split or combination as provided in Section 4(e) or upon a
dividend or distribution as provided in Section 4(f)), without consideration or for a consideration
per share less than any Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issue, then and in
such event, such Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price
(calculated to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction,
(A) the numerator of which shall be (1) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding

_ immediately prior to such issue (calculated assuming conversion of all issued and outstanding

shares of Preferred Stock as well as all other issued and outstanding Convertible Securities, and
the exercise, exchange or conversion of all then outstanding options, warrants or subscription
rights) plus (2) the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration
received or to be received by the Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of

10227168 5 a] 5»

P.

16
', AUG-21-2006 a9:29 MBBP 781 622 5933 P.17

Common Stock so issued would purchase at such Conversion Price; and (B) the denominator of
which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such
issue (calculated assuming conversion of all issued and outstanding shares of Preferred Stock as
well as all other issued and outstanding Convertible Securities, and the exercise, exchange or

“conversion of all then outstanding options, warrants or subscription rights) plus the number of.
such Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued; provided that, the number of shares of
Common Stock deemed issuable upon exercise or conversion of such outstanding Options and
Convertible Securities shall not give effect to any adjustments to the conversion price or
conversion rate of such Options or Convertible Securities resulting from the issuance of
Additional Shares of Common Stock that is the subject of this calculation.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this Section 4(d), |
the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional Shares of Common
Stock shall be computed as follows:

(A) Cash and Property: Such consideration shall:

(1) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
aggregate of cash received by the Corporation, excluding amounts paid or payable for accrued
interest;

(2) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair market value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith
by the Board of Directors; and

(3) in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock
are issued together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for
consideration which covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed
as provided in clauses (1) and (2) above, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(B) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per

share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been
issued pursuant to Subsection 4(d)(iii), relating to Options and Convertible Securities, shall be
determined by dividing:

(1) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by
the Corporation as consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the
minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating
thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such
consideration) payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the
exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities, by

10127168_5 -16-
, AUG-21-2886 99:29 MBBP 7B1 G22 $933

(2) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock
(as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein
for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the -
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities. |

(vi} Multiple Closing Dates. In the event the Corporation shall issue on
more than one date Additional Shares of Common Stock which are comprised of shares of the
same series or class of Preferred Stock, and such issuance dates occur within a period of no more
than 120 days, then, upon the final such issuance, each applicable Conversion Price shall be
adjusted to give effect to all such issuances as if they occurred on the date of the final such
issuance {and without giving effect to any adjustments as a result of such prior issuances within

such period).

(e) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If the Corporation shall at

any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date effect a subdivision of the outstanding
Common Stock, each Conversion Price then in effect immediately before that subdivision shall
be proportionately decreased. If the Corporation shail at any time or from time to time after the
Original Issue Date combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock, each Conversion Price
then in effect immediately before the combination shall be proportionately increased. Any
adjustment under this paragraph shal! become effective at the close of business on the date the
subdivision or combination becomes effective.

(f) Adjustment for Certain Dividends and Distributions. In the event the

Corporation at any time, or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall make or issue, or
fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a
dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock, then and in each
such event each Conversion Price then in effect immediately before such event shall be decreased
as of the time of such issuance or, in the event such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the
close of business on such record date, by multiplying such Conversion Price then in effect by a
fraction:

(i) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of
Common Stock actually issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or
the close of business on such record date, and

(ii) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of
Common Stock actually issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or
the close of business on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in
payment of such dividend or distribution to the holders of Common Stock: provided, however, if
such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend is not fully paid or if such distribution
is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, such Conversion Price shall be recomputed
accordingly as of the close of business on such record date and thereafter such Conversion Price
Shall be adjusted pursuant to this paragraph as of the time of actual payment of such dividends or
distributions; and provided further, however, that no such adjustment shall be made if the holders
of Preferred Stock simultaneously receive (i) a dividend or other distribution of shares of
Cornmon Stock in a number equal to the number of shares of Common Stock as they would have

10127168 5 ~]7-

*P.18
AUG-21-2886 @9:30 MBBP 781 622 5933 P.19

received if all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock on .
the date of such event or (ii) a dividend or other distribution of shares of Preferred Stock which
are convertible, as of the date of such event, into such number of shares of Common Stock as is
equal to the number of additional shares of Common Stock being issued with respect to each
share of Common Stock in such dividend or distribution.

(g} Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. In the event the

Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall make or issue, or
fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a
dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the Corporation other than shares of
Common Stock, then and in each such event provision shall be made so that the holders of .
Preferred Stock shall-receive upon conversion thereof in addition to the number of shares of
Common Stock receivable thereupon, the amount of securities of the Corporation that they would
have received had the Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock on the date of such
event and had they thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to and including the
conversion date, retained such securities receivable by them as aforesaid during such period,
giving application to all adjustments called for during such period under this paragraph with
tespect to the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock; and provided further, however, that no
such adjustment shall be made if the holders of Preferred Stock simultaneously receive a
dividend or other distribution of such securities in an amount equal to the amount of such
securities as they would have received if all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock had been
converted into Common Stock on the date of such event.

(h) Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange, or Substitution. If the

Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be changed into the
same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by capital
reorganization, reclassification, or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares
or stock dividend provided for above, or a reorganization, merger, consolidation, or sale of assets
provided for below), then and in each such event the holder of each such share of Preferred Stock
shall have the right thereafter to convert such share into the kind and amount of shares of stock
and other securities and property receivable, upon such reorganization, reclassification, or other
change, by holders of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of
Preferred Stock might have been converted immediately prior to such reorganization,
reclassification, or change, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein.

Q) Adjustment for Merger or Reorganization, etc. In case of any

consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into another corporation or the sale of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Corporation to another corporation (other than a
consolidation, merger or sale which is covered by Section 2(d)), each share of Preferred Stock
shall thereafter be convertible (or shall be converted into a security which shall be convertible)
into the kind and amount of shares of stock or other securities or property to which a holder of
the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation deliverable upon conversion of such
Preferred Stock would have been entitled upon such consolidation, merger or sale; and, in such
case, appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) shall be
made in the application of the provisions in this Section 4 set forth with respect to the rights and
interest thereafter of the holders of Preferred Stock to the end that the provisions set forth in this

10127168_5 -18-
AUG-21-2086 @9:36 MBBP 781 622 5933

Section 4 (including provisions with respect to changes in and other adjustments of the
Conversion Price) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to
any shares of stock or other property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of the Preferred’
Stock.

G) Adjustment for Failure to Redeem. In the event that the Corporation shall
fail to pay in full any amount due for redemption of shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to Section
6 hereof on the date such redemption amount is due, then each of the Series A Conversion Price,
the Series B Conversion Price, the Series C Conversion Price and the Series D Conversion Price
immediately shall be decreased by ten percent (10%) on such Default Date (as defined in Section
3(b)), and each such Conversion Price thereafter shall be decreased at the rate of ten percent
(10%) every ninety (90) days thereafter until such time as such redemption amount is paid in full.

(k) NoImpairment. The Corporation will not, by amendment of its Certificate
of Incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger,
dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the
observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the
Corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of
this Section 4 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to
protect the Conversion Rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock against impairment.

(I) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of any Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation at its expense
shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and
furnish to each holder of the affected Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment
or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is
based. The Corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of Preferred
Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a similar certificate setting forth (i) such
adjustments and readjustments, (ii) the Conversion Price then in effect for the Preferred Stock
held by such holder, and (iii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of
other property which then would be received upon the conversion of such Preferred Stock.

(m) Notice of Record Date. In the event:

(i) that the Corporation declares a dividend (or any other distribution)
on its Commion Stock payable in Common Stock or other securities of the Corporation;

(ii) _ that the Corporation subdivides or combines its outstanding shares
of Common Stock;

(ii) —_ of any reclassification of the Common Stock of the Corporation

the office of the transfer agent of the Preferred Stock, and shall cause to be mailed to the holders

of the Preferred Stock at their last addresses as shown on the records of the Corporation or such

transfer agent, at least ten days prior to the date specified in (A) below or twenty days before the
, date specified in (B) below, a notice stating:

(A) _ the record date of such dividend, distribution, subdivision

Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distribution, subdivision or combination are to be
determined, or

(B) _ the date on which such reclassification, consolidation,
merger, sale, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to become effective, and the date
as of which it is expected that holders of Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange
their shares of Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such
reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, dissolution or winding up; provided, however, that
the Corporation's failure to provide any notice required under this Section 4(m) after using
reasonable efforts shall not be deemed a default, breach or violation of this Section 4(m).

5. Mandatory Conversion.

(a) Upon (i) the closing of the sale of shares of Common Stock, at a price to
the public of at least $3.40 per share (subject to appropriate adjustment for stock splits, stock

underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, resulting in at least $30,000,000 of proceeds (after deducting
underwriter discounts and commissions) to the Corporation or (ii) a vote of the holders of at least
70% of the votes attributable to the Preferred Stock, determined on an as-converted basis as
provided in Section 3(a) (each a “Mandatory Conversion Date”), (i) all outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock, at the then
effective conversion rate and (ii) the number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock shall be
automatically reduced by the number of shares of Preferred Stock that had been designated as
Preferred Stock, and all provisions for the Preferred Stock set forth in Sections 1 through 7
hereof, and all references to the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock, the Series
C Preferred Stock and the Series D Preferred Stock, shall be deleted and shall be of no further
force or effect.

(6) All holders of record of shares of Preferred Stock shall be given written
notice of the Mandatory Conversion Date and the place designated for mandatory conversion of
all such shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 5. Such notice need not be given in.
advance of the occurrence of the Mandatory Conversion Date. Such notice shall be sent by first
Class or registered mail, postage prepaid, to each record holder of Preferred Stock at such holder's
address last shown on the records of the transfer agent for the Preferred Stock (or the records of

101271638_S 30-
AUG-21-2886 99:30 MBBP 781 622 5933 P.22

the Corporation, if it serves as its own transfer agent). Upon receipt of such notice, each holder of
shares of Preferred Stock shall surrender his or its certificate or certificates for all such shares to
the Corporation at the place designated in such notice, and shall thereafter receive certificates for
the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is éntitled pursuant to this

Section 5. On the Mandatory Conversion Date, all rights with respect to the Preferred Stock so
converted, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and vote (other than as a holder of
Common Stock) will terminate, except only the rights of the holders thereof, upon surrender of
their certificate or certificates therefor, to receive certificates for the number of shares of
Common Stock into which such Preferred Stock has been converted, and payment of any
declared but unpaid dividends thereon. If so required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered
for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by written instrument or instruments of
transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or by his
or its attorney duly authorized in writing. As soon as practicable after the Mandatory Conversion
‘Date and the surrender of the certificate or certificates for Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall
cause to be issued and delivered to such holder, or on his or its written order, a certificate or
certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable on such conversion in
accordance with the provisions hereof and cash as provided in Section 4(b) in respect of any
fraction of 2 share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion.

(c) All certificates evidencing shares of Preferred Stock which are required to
be surrendered for conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof shall, from and after the
Mandatory Conversion Date, be deemed to have been retired and cancelled and the shares of
Preferred Stock represented thereby converted into Common Stock for all purposes,
notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender such certificates on or
prior to such date. Such converted Preferred Stock may not be reissued, and the Corporation may
thereafter take such apprepriate action (without the need for stockholder action) as may be
necessary to redygethe a nhdrized number of shares of Preferred Stock accordingly.

The Corporation will, subject to the conditions set forth below, on August
15, 2011 and on each of the first and second anniversaries thereof (each such date being referred
to hereinafter as a “Mandatory Redemption Date”), upon receipt not less than 60 nor more than
120 days prior to the applicable Mandatory Redemption Date of written request(s) for
redemption from holders of at least 70% of the votes attributable to the shares of the Preferred
Stock then outstanding, determined on an as-converted basis as provided in Section 3(a) (an
