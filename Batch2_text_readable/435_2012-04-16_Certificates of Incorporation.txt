(e) Certain Acquisitions.

(i) Deemed Liquidation. For purposes of this Section 2, a
liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation shall be deemed to
occur if the Corporation shall sell, convey, or otherwise dispose of all or
substantially all of its property or business or merge with or into or consolidate
with any other corporation, limited liability company or other entity (other than a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation), including any transaction or series
of transactions, which results in the transfer of 50% or more of the outstanding
voting securities of the Corporation (any such transaction or series of transactions,
a “Liquidation Transaction’), provided that none of the following shall be
considered a Liquidation Transaction: (i) a merger effected exclusively for the
purpose of changing the domicile of the Corporation, (ii) a bona fide equity
financing in which the Corporation is the surviving corporation, (ili) a transaction
or series of transactions in which the stockholders of the Corporation immediately
prior to the transaction own, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the voting
power of the surviving corporation, in the same relative proportions, following the
transaction, or (iv) a transaction or series of transactions that the holders of a
majority of the outstanding Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class on an
as-converted to Common Stock basis, elect to waive being treated as a
Liquidation Transaction under this Section 2(e)(1).

(ii) Notwithstanding Sections 2(a), (b), (c) and (d) above,
for purposes of determining the amount cach holder of shares of Preferred Stock is
entitled to receive with respect to a liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the
Corporation or a Liquidation Transaction, each such holder of shares of a series of
Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have converted (regardless of whether such
holder actually converted) such holder’s shares of such series into shares of
Common Stock immediately prior to the liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of
the Corporation or Liquidation Transaction, as applicable, if, as a result of an
actual conversion, such holder would receive, in the aggregate, an amount greater
than the amount that would be distributed to such holder if such holder did not
convert such series of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock. If any such
holder shall be deemed to have converted shares of a series of Preferred Stock
into Common Stock pursuant to this paragraph, then the holder of such series shall

pa- 1520976
not be entitled to receive any other distribution with respect to such series of
Preferred Stock.

(iii) Valuation of Consideration. In the event of a deemed
liquidation as described in Section 2(e)(i) above, if the consideration received by
the Corporation is other than cash, its value will be deemed its fair market value.
Any securities shall be valued as follows:

(A) Securities not subject to investment letter or
other:

(B) If traded on a securities exchange, the value
shall be based on a formula approved by the Board of Directors and derived from
the closing prices of the securities on such exchange over a specified time period;

(C) — If actively traded over-the-counter, the value
shall be based on a formula approved by the Board of Directors and derived from
the closing bid or sales prices (whichever is applicable) of such securities over a
specified time period; and

(D) If there is no active public market, the value
shall be the fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors.

(1) The method of valuation of securities
subject to investment letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than
restrictions arising solely by virtue of a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or
former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount from the market value
determined as specified above in Section 2(¢)(i1i)(A) to reflect the approximate
fair market value thereof, as unanimously determined in good faith by the Board
of Directors.

(iv) Notice of Liquidation Transaction. The
Corporation shall give each holder of record of Series B-3, Series C, Series C-1
or Series C-2 Preferred Stock written notice of any impending Liquidation
Transaction not later than 10 days prior to the stockholders’ meeting called to
approve such Liquidation Transaction, or 10 days prior to the closing of such
Liquidation Transaction, whichever is earlier, and shall also notify such holders in
writing of the final approval of such Liquidation Transaction. The first of such
notices shall describe the material terms and conditions of the impending
Liquidation Transaction and the provisions of this Section 2, and the Corporation
shall thereafter give such holders prompt notice of any material changes. Unless
such notice requirements are waived, the Liquidation Transaction shall not take
place sooner than 10 days after the Corporation has given the first notice provided
for herein or sooner than 10 days after the Corporation has given notice of any
material changes provided for herein. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this
Restated Certificate, all notice periods or requirements in this Restated Certificate

pa- 1520976
may be shortened or waived, either before or after the action for which notice is
required, upon the written consent of the holders of at least a majority of the
voting power of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (voting together as a
single class and on an as converted basis) that are entitled to such notice rights.

(v) Effect of Noncompliance. In the event the
requirements of this Section 2(e) are not complied with, the Corporation shall
forthwith either cause the closing of the Liquidation Transaction to be postponed
until the requirements of this Section 2 have been complied with, or cancel such
Liquidation Transaction, in which event the rights, preferences, privileges and
restrictions of the holders of Series B-3, Series C, Series C-1 and Series C-2
Preferred Stock shall revert to and be the same as such rights, preferences,
privileges and restrictions existing immediately prior to the date of the first notice
referred to in Section 2(e){iv).

3. [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED].

4, Conversion. The holders of Preferred Stock shall have conversion
tights as follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Subject to Sections 4(c) and 8, each
share of Series B-3, Series C, Series C-1 and Series C-2 Preferred Stock shall be
convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of
such share, at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for such stock, into
such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined
by dividing (1) $0.471 in the case of the Series B-3 Preferred Stock (as adjusted for
stock splits, stock dividends, reclassification or the like), (ii) $0.471 in the case of the
Series C Preferred Stock (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reclassification
or the like), (111) $0.471 in the case of the Series C-1 Preferred Stock (as adjusted for
stock splits, stock dividends, reclassification or the like) or (iv) $0.306 in the case of
the Series C-2 Preferred Stock (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends,
reclassification or the like), by the Conversion Price applicable to such share,
determined as hereafter provided, in effect on the date the certificate is surrendered
for conversion (the conversion rate for the Series B-3, Series C, Series C-1 and Series
C-2 Preterred Stock into Common Stock is referred to herein as the “Conversion
Rate” for such series). The initial Conversion Price per share shall be $0.471 for
shares of Series B-3 Preferred Stock, $0.471 for shares of Series C Preferred Stock,
$0.3925 for shares of Scries C-1 Preferred Stock and $0.255 for shares of Series C-2
Preferred Stock. Such initial Conversion Prices shall be subject to adjustment as set
forth in Section 4(d) below.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Series B-3, Series C,
Series C-1 and Series C-2 Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into
shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Rate at the time in effect for such share
immediately upon the earlier of (1) except as provided below in Section 4(c), the
Corporation’s sale of its Common Stock in a firm commitment underwritten public
offering pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as

pa- 1520976
amended (the “Securities Act”) which results in aggregate cash proceeds to the
Corporation of at least $50,000,000 (net of underwriting discounts and commissions)
or (i) the date specified by written consent or agreement of the holders of a majority
of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a class and on an
as converted basis; provided, however, that if such automatic conversion is in
connection with a Liquidation Transaction in which the aggregate proceeds being
distributed to the stockholders of the Corporation is less than the sum of (1)
$40,000,000 plus (ii) the product (rounded up to the nearest penny) of (A) $0.471 (as
adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reclassification or the like) multiplied by
(B) the total number of shares of Series C-2 Preferred Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Liquidation Transaction, the shares of Preferred Stock shall not be so
converted without the vote or written consent of the holders of at least 66-2/3% of the
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class and on an as
converted basis.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Series B-3,
Series C, Series C-1 or Series C-2 Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert such
Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, the holder shall surrender the certificate
or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any
transfer agent for such series of Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the
Corporation at its principal corporate office, of the election to convert the same and
shall state therein the name or names in which the certificate or certificates for shares
of Common Stock are to be issued. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable
thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to the
nominee or nominecs of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of
shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid. Such
conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of
business on the date of such surrender of the shares of such series of Preferred Stock
to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common
Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record
holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock as of such date. If the conversion
is in connection with an underwritten public offering of securities registered pursuant
to the Securities Act the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering such
Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters
of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering, in which event any persons entitled
to receive Common Stock upon conversion of such Preferred Stock shall not be
deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing
of such sale of securities.

(d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock for
Certain Dilutive Issuances, Splits and Combinations. The Conversion Price of the
Scries B-3, Series C, Series C-1 and Series C-2 Preferred Stock shall be subject to
adjustnent from time to time as follows:

(i) Issuance of Additional Stock below Purchase Price. If
the Corporation should issue, at any time after the filing date of the Restated
Certificate (the “Filing Date’), any Additional Stock (as defined below) without

pa- 1520976
consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Conversion Price for
such series in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock,
the Conversion Price for such series in effect immediately prior to each such
issuance shall automatically be adjusted as set forth in this Section 4(d)(i), unless
otherwise provided in this Section 4(d)(1).

(A) Adjustment Formula. Whenever the
Conversion Price is adjusted pursuant to this Section (4)(d)(1), the new Conversion
Price shall be determined by multiplying the Conversion Price then in effect by a
fraction, (x) the numerator of which shal] be the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance (the “Outstanding
Common’) plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate
consideration received by the Corporation for such issuance would purchase at
such Conversion Price; and (y) the denominator of which shall be the number of
shares of Outstanding Common plus the number of shares of such Additional
Stock. For purposes of the foregoing calculation, the term “Outstanding
Common” shall include shares of Common Stock deemed issued pursuant to
Section 4(d)({1)(E) below.

(B) Definition of “Additional Stock.” For
purposes of this Section 4(d)(i), “Additional Stock” shall mean any shares of
Common Stock issued (or deemed to have been issued pursuant to Section
4(d)(1)(E)) by the Corporation after the Filing Date) other than:

(1) Common Stock issued pursuant to stock
dividends, stock splits or similar transactions, as described in Section 4(d)(i1)
hercof;

purchase capital stock, issued to financial institutions or lessors in connection with
commercial credit arrangements, equipment financings, commercial property lease
transactions or similar transactions the principal purpose of which is other than

unanimously approved by the Board of Directors;

(4) Shares of Common Stock or Preferred
Stock issuable upon exercise of warrants, notes or other rights to acquire
securities of the Corporation outstanding as of the date of this Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation:

pa-1520976
(5) Capital stock, or warrants or options to
purchase capital stock, issued in connection with bona fide acquisitions, mergers
or similar transactions, the terms of which are approved by the Board of Directors;

(6) Shares of Common Stock issuable or
issued upon conversion of the Series B-3, Series C, Series C-1 or Series C-2
Preferred Stock (including the Common Stock deemed to have been issued upon
the original issuance of the Series C-1 Preferred Stock);

(7) Shares of Common Stock issued or
issuable in a public offering prior to or in connection with which all outstanding
shares of Series B-3, Series C, Series C-1 and Series C-2 Preferred Stock will be
converted to Common Stock;

(8) Shares of Common Stock issued
primarily for purposes other than raising capital that, with the unanimous approval
of the Corporation’s Board of Directors, are expressly not deemed “Additional
Stock;":

(9) | Shares of Common Stock issued or
deemed issued pursuant to Section 4(d)(i)(E) as a result of a decrease in the
Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock resulting from the operation of
this Section 4(d);

(10) Capital stock deemed issued pursuant to
Section 4(d)({i)(E) due to the issuance of, or issued or issuable upon the exercise

February 3, 2011;

(11) Capital stock deemed issued pursuant to
Section 4(d)(i)(E) due to the issuance of, or issued or issuable upon the exercise or

Agreement initially executed in November 2011, as may be amended from time to
time, the terms of which have been approved by the Board of Directors;

(12) Capital stock deemed issued pursuant to
Section 4(d)(1)(E) due to the issuance of, or issued or issuable upon the exercise or
conversion of, warrants issued in connection with the issuance by the Corporation

from time to time, the terms of which have been approved by the Board of
Directors; and

(13) Up to 71,000,000 shares of Common

Purchase Agreement dated on or about the Filing Date.

(C) No Fractional Adjustments. No adjustment of
the Conversion Price for the Series B-3, Series C, Series C-1 or Series C-2

into account in any subsequent adjustment made prior to three years from the date
of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward, or shall be made
at the end of three years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment
being carried forward.

(D) Determination of Consideration. In the case of
the issuance of Common Stock for cash, the consideration shall be deemed to be
the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting any reasonable discounts,
commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the Corporation for
any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof. In
the case of the issuance of the Common Stock for a consideration in whole or in
part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be deemed to be the
fair value thereof as determined by the Board of Directors irrespective of any
accounting treatment.

(E) Deemed Issuances of Common Stock. In the
case of the issuance (whether before, on or after the Filing Date) of securities or
rights convertible into, or entitling the holder thereof to receive directly or
indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock (the “Common Stock
Equivalents”), the following provisions shall apply for all purposes of this Section
4(d)(i):

(1) The aggregate maximum number of
shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion, exchange or exercise
(assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to convertibility, exchangeability or
exercisability, including, without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking
into account potential antidilution adjustments) of any Common Stock Equivalents
and subsequent conversion, exchange or exercise thereof shall be deemed to have
been issued at the time such securities were issued or such Common Stock
Equivalents were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration, if any,
received by the Corporation for any such securities and related Common Stock
Equivalents (excluding any cash received on account of accrued interest or
accrued dividends), plus the minimum additional consideration, if any, to be
received by the Corporation (without taking into account potential antidilution
adjustments) upon the conversion, exchange or exercise of any Common Stock
Equivalents (the consideration in each case to be determined in the manner
provided in Section 4(d)(i)(D)).

pa-1520976
(2) In the event of any change in the number
of shares of Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to the
Corporation upon conversion, exchange or exercise of any Common Stock
Equivalents, other than a change resulting from the antidilution provisions thereof,
the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way
affected by or computed using such Common Stock Equivalents, shall be
tecomputed to reflect such change, but no further adjustment shall be made for the
actual issuance of Common Stock or any payment of such consideration upon the
conversion, exchange or exercise of such Common Stock Equivalents.

(3) Upon the termination or expiration of the
convertibility, exchangeability or exercisability of any Common Stock
Equivalents, the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock, to the extent in
any way affected by or computed using such Common Stock Equivalents, shall be
recomputed to reflect the issuance of only the number of shares of Common Stock
(and Common Stock Equivalents that remain convertible, exchangeable or
exercisable) actually issued upon the conversion, exchange or exercise of such
Common Stock Equivalents.

(4) |The number of shares of Common Stock
deemed issued and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to Section
4(d)(i)(E)(1) shall be appropriately adjustcd to reflect any change, termination or
expiration of the type described in either Section 4(d)(i)(E)(2) or 4(d)()(E)(3).

(F) No Increased Conversion Price.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section (4)(d)(i), except to the limited
extent provided for in Sections 4(d)(i)(E)(2) and 4(d)(i)(E)(3), no adjustment of
the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4(d)(i) shall have the cffect of
increasing the Conversion Price above the Conversion Price in effect immediately
prior to such adjustment.

(ii) Stock Splits and Dividends. In the event the
Corporation should at any time after the Filing Date fix a record date for the
effectuation of a split or subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock
or the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive a dividend or
other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock or Common
Stock Equivalents without payment of any consideration by such holder for the
additional shares of Common Stock or the Common Stock Equivalents (including
the additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise
thereof), then, as of such record date (or the date of such dividend distribution,
split or subdivision if no record date is fixed), the Conversion Price of each of the
Series B-3, Series C, Series C-! and Series C-2 Preferred Stock shall be
appropriately decreased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable
on conversion of each share of such series shall be increased in proportion to such
increase of the aggregate of shares of Common Stock outstanding and those
issuable with respect to such Common Stock Equivalents with the number of

pa- 1520976
shares issuable with respect to Common Stock Equivalents determined from time
to time in the manner provided for deemed issuances in Section 4(d)(i)(E).

(iii) Reverse Stock Splits. [f the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding at any time after the Filing Date is decreased by a
combination of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, then, following the
record date of such combination, the Conversion Price for each of the Series B-3,
Scries C, Series C-1 and Series C-2 Preferred Stock shall be appropriately
increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion
of each share of such series shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in
outstanding shares.

(e) Other Distributions. In the event the Corporation shall
declare a distribution payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness
issued by the Corporation or other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or
options or rights not referred to in Section4(d)(i) or 4(d)(ii), then, in each such case for
the purpose of this Section 4(e), the holders of Series B-3, Series C, Series C-1 and
Series C-2 Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any such
distribution as though they were the holders of the number of shares of Common
Stock of the Corporation into which their shares of Preferred Stock are convertible as
of the record date fixed for the determination of the holders of Common Stock of the
Corporation entitled to receive such distribution.

(f) Recapitalizations. If at any time or from time to time there
shall be a recapitalization of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision,
combination or merger or sale of assets transaction provided for elsewhere in this
Section 4 or in Section 2) provision shall be made so that the holders of the Series B-
3, Series C, Series C-1 and Series C-2 Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to
receive upon conversion of such Preferred Stock the number of shares of stock or
other securities or property of the Corporation or otherwise, to which a holder of
Common Stock deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled on such
recapitalization,

In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application
of the provisions of this Section 4 with respect to the rights of the holders of such Preferred
Stock after the recapitalization to the end that the provisions of this Section 4 (including
adjustment of the Conversion Price then in effect and the number of shares purchasable upon
conversion of such Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event and be as nearly
equivalent as practicable.

(g) No Fractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments.

conversion of any share or shares of the Series B-3, Series C, Series C-1 or Series
C-2 Preferred Stock, and the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued
shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share. The number of shares issuable
upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of

12
pa-1520976
shares of Series B-3, Series C, Series C-1 or Series C-2 Preferred Stock the holder
is at the time converting into Common Stock and the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such aggregate conversion. If the conversion would
result in any fractional share, the Corporation shall, in lien of issuing any such
fractional share, pay the holder thereof an amount in cash equal to the fair market
value of such fractional share on the date of conversion, as determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors.

(ii) Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Conversion Price of Series B-3, Series C, Series C-1 or
Serics C-2 Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation, at its
expense, shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance
with the terms hereof and prepare and furnish to each holder of such Preferred
Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in
detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The
Corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of Series B-
3, Series C, Series C-1 or Series C-2 Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be
furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (A) such adjustment and
readjustment, (B) the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock at the
time in effect, and (C) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if
any, of other property which at the time would be received upon the conversion of
a share of such series of Preferred Stock.

(h) Notices of Record Date. In the event of any taking by the
Corporation of a record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of
determining the holders thereof who are entitled to reccive any dividend (other than a
cash dividend) or other distribution, any right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise
acquire any shares of stock of any class or any other securities or property, or to
receive any other right, the Corporation shall mail to each holder of Serics B-3, Series
C, Series C-1 or Series C-2 Preferred Stock, at least 10 days prior to the date specified
therein, a notice specitying the date on which any such record is to be taken for the
purpose of such dividend, distribution or right, and the amount and character of such
dividend, distribution or right.

Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but

unissued shares of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion
of the shares of the Series B-3, Series C, Series C-1 and Series C-2 Preferred Stock,
such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to
effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of such scries of Preferred Stock; and if
at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not
be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of such series of
Preferred Stock, in addition to such other remedies as shail be available to the holder
of such Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the
opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of
Common Stock to such number of shares as shal] be sufficient for such purposes,

(a) In the event after August 6, 2009:

16
pa- 1520976
(i) the Corporation’s Board of Directors approves a
financing that will result in the sale of any shares of, or securities convertible into
or exchangeable or exercisable for any shares of, its capital stock;

(ii) the Board of Directors of the Corporation (with
interested directors able to vote for purposes of this provision) determines that it 1s
in the best interests of the Corporation for the holders of Preferred Stock of the
Corporation to participate in such financing (in which case such financing will be
deemed a “Mandatory Offering”) and determines the aggregate dollar amount to
be invested by all holders of Preterred Stock (the “Aggregate Investment
Amount”). which, for avoidance of doubt, amount may represent more or less
than the total proceeds actually raised by the Corporation from the holders of
Preferred Stock in the financing;

(iii) the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares
of Preferred Stock, voting together as a class and on an as converted basis, also
determine that the financing shall be a Mandatory Offering;

(iv) the Corporation delivers a notice (“Notice) to the
holders of Preferred Stock (i) stating the Corporation’s bona fide intention to
consummate such financing, (11) indicating the number of securities to be offered,
(ili) indicating the price and terms upon which it proposes to offer such securities,
(iv) identifying the Pro Rata Share (as defined below) of each holder of Preferred
Stock of the Aggregate Investment Amount, and (v) offering each holder of
Preferred Stock the right to purchase such holder’s Pro Rata Share of the
Agercgate Investment Amount within the time periods set forth in the Notice; and

(v) a holder and/or an affiliate of such holder (a ‘““Non-
Participating Holder”) does not acquire at least such holder’s Pro Rata Share of
the Aggregate Investment Amount (whether or not such Aggregate Investment
Amount is more than or less than the aggregate dollar amount actually reccived by
the Corporation from the holders in connection with the Mandatory Offering, as
may be the case, for example, if certain holders do not participate in the
Mandatory Offering) within the time periods set forth in the Notice; then all of
each Non-Participating Holder’s shares of Preferred Stock (and any other
securities exercisable therefor) shall automatically and without further action on
the part of such holder be converted, effective upon, subject to and concurrently
with the consummation of the Mandatory Offering (the “Mandatory Offering
Date’), into shares of Common Stock of the Corporation (or securities exercisable
therefor) at a Conversion Rate equal to the Conversion Rate in effect immediately
prior to the consummation of the Mandatory Offering. For purposes of this
Section, each hojder’s “Pro Rata Share” of the Aggregate Investment Amount
shall be an amount determined by multiplying the Aggregate Investment Amount
by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock held by such holder
immediately prior to the consummation of the Mandatory Offering and the
denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock

17
pa-1520976
issuable upon conversion of all Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the consummation of the Mandatory Offering. A holder’s Pro Rata Share may
equal more or less than any such holder’s right to participate in a financing of the
Corporation pursuant to any contractual right of first offer or similar right.

(b) The holder of any shares of Preferred Stock (or other
securities exercisable therefor) converted pursuant to this Section 8 shal! deliver to the
Corporation during regular business hours at the office of any transfer agent of the
Corporation for the Preferred Stock, or at such other place as may be designated by the
Corporation, the certificate or certificates for the shares so converted, duly endorsed
or assigned tn blank or to the Corporation. As promptly as practicable thereafter, the
Corporation shall issue and deliver to such holder, at the place designated by such
holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of the Common Stock
to be issued and such holder shall be deemed to have become a stockholder of record
of Common Stock on the Mandatory Offering Date, unless the transfer books of the
Corporation are closed on that date, in which event such holder shall be deemed to
have become a stockholder of record of Common Stock on the next succeeding date
on which the transfer books are open. From and after the Mandatory Offering Date,
the certificate or certificates representing shares of Preferred Stock (or other securities
exercisable therefor) converted pursuant to this Section 8 shall represent the shares of
Common Stock (or other securities exercisable therefor) into which such shares of
Preferred Stock were converted.

(c) Common Stock.

ot all classes of stock at the time outstanding having prior rights as to dividends,

be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then
outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of shares of stock of the

18
pa- 1520976
Corporation representing a majority of the votes represented by all outstanding
shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote, irrespective of the provisions of
Section 242(b)(2) of the Delaware General Corporation Law.
