l. Dividends.

The Corporation shall not declare, pay or set aside any dividends on shares of any other

an amount at least equal to (i) in the case of a dividend on Common Stock or any class or series
that is convertible into Common Stock, that dividend per share of Series A Preferred Stock or
Series B Preferred Stock, as the case may be, as would equal the product of (A) the dividend
payable on each share of such class or series determined, if applicable, as if all such shares of
such class or series had been converted into Common Stock and (B) the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of a share of Series A Preferred Stock or a share of

determination of holders entitled to receive such dividend or (ii) in the case of a dividend on any

Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, as the case may be, determined by dividing the
amount of the dividend payable on each share of such class or series of capital stock by the

then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid out of the assets available for distribution to its
stockholders on a pari passu basis with the holders of any series of Preferred Stock ranking on

-3-
liquidation on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock and,
before any payment shall be made to the holders of Common Stock or any other class or series of
stock ranking on liquidation junior to the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock
(such Common Stock and other stock being collectively referred to as “Junior Stock’’) by reason

case of the Series A Preferred Stock, and an amount per share equal to the Series B Original
Issue Price, in the case of the Series B Preferred Stock, plus, with respect to the Series A
Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock, any dividends declared but unpaid thereon. If

available for distribution to its stockholders shall be insufficient to pay the holders of shares of
Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and any series of Preferred Stock ranking on
liquidation on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock the full
amount to which they shall be entitled, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series
B Preferred Stock and any series of Preferred Stock ranking on liquidation on a parity with the
Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock shall share ratably in any distribution of
the assets available for distribution in proportion to the respective amounts which would

liquidation senior to the Common Stock, the remaining assets available for distribution to the
Corporation’s stockholders shall be distributed among the holders of the shares of Series A
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Common Stock and any other series of capital stock
entitled pursuant to the terms of this Certificate of Incorporation to participate with the Common
Stock in the distribution of such remaining assets, pro rata based on the number of shares held by
each such holder, treating for this purpose all such securities as if they had been converted to
Common Stock pursuant to the terms of this Certificate of Incorporation immediately prior to
such dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Corporation. For the purposes hereof:

Preferred Stock is entitled to receive under Subsections 2(a) and 2(b) is hereinafter referred to as

be entitled to receive upon such dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Corporation the
greater of (i) the Series A Maximum Participation Amount and (ii) the amount such holder
would have received if all holders had converted their shares of Preferred Stock into Common
Stock immediately prior to such dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Corporation (in
which case the greater of (i) or (ii) of this clause (A) shall be referred to as the “Series A
Liquidation Amount”); and

dividend, combination, reclassification, or similar event affecting the Series B Preferred Stock)

be entitled to receive upon such dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Corporation the
greater of (i) the Series B Maximum Participation Amount and (ii) the amount such holder would
have received if all holders had converted their shares of Preferred Stock into Common Stock
immediately prior to such dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Corporation (in which
case the greater of (i) or (ii) of this clause (B) shall be referred to as the “Series B Liquidation
Amount”).

voting power, of the capital stock of (1) the surviving or resulting corporation or (2) if the
surviving or resulting corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary of another corporation
immediately following such merger or consolidation, the parent corporation of such surviving or
resulting corporation (provided that, for the purpose of this Subsection 2(c)(i), all shares of
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Options (as defined in Subsection 4(d)) outstanding
immediately prior to such merger or consolidation or upon conversion of Convertible Securities
(as defined in Subsection 4(d)) outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation
shall be deemed to be outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation and, if
applicable, converted or exchanged in such merger or consolidation on the same terms as the
actual outstanding shares of Common Stock are converted or exchanged); or
(B) the sale, lease, transfer, exclusive license or other
disposition, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, by the Corporation or any
subsidiary of the Corporation of all or substantially all the assets of the Corporation and its

disposition is to a wholly owned subsidiary of the Corporation.

Corporation in accordance with Subsections 2(a) and 2(b) above.

(iii) In the event of a Deemed Liquidation Event pursuant to Subsection
2(c)(i)(A)(I]) or 2(c)(i)(B) above, if the Corporation does not effect a dissolution of the

two-thirds of the then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred

instrument delivered to the Corporation not later than 105 days after such Deemed Liquidation
Event, the Corporation shall use the consideration received by the Corporation for such Deemed
Liquidation Event (net of any retained liabilities associated with the assets sold or technology
licensed, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation) (the “Net

Preferred Stock, or if the Corporation does not have sufficient lawfully available funds to effect
such redemption, the Corporation shall redeem a pro rata portion of each holder’s shares of
Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, based on the respective amounts that
would otherwise be payable in respect of the shares to be redeemed if the Net Proceeds were
sufficient to redeem all such outstanding shares, to the fullest extent of such Net Proceeds or
such lawfully available funds, as the case may be, and, where such redemption is limited by the
amount of lawfully available funds, the Corporation shall redeem the remaining shares to have
been redeemed as soon as practicable after the Corporation has funds legally available therefor.

entity. The value of such property, rights or securities shall be determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors of the Corporation.

action or consideration at any meeting of stockholders of the Corporation (or by written consent

of whole shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B
Preferred Stock, as the case may be, held by such holder are convertible as of the record date for

provisions of Subsection 3(b) or 3(c) below, holders of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B

the Corporation and with respect to the payment of dividends and redemption rights, or increase
the authorized number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock or

winding up of the Corporation and with respect to the payment of dividends and redemption
rights, or create or authorize any obligation or security convertible into shares of any class or

the Corporation; or

(v) incur indebtedness for borrowed money in excess of $250,000,
unless approved by a majority of the non-employee members of the Board of Directors of the

4. Optional Conversion.

The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as follows (the
“Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert.

(i) Each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the
option of the holder thereof, at any time and from time to time, and without the payment of
additional consideration by the holder thereof, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable
shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing $1.00 by the Series A Conversion Price in
effect at the time of conversion. The “Series A Conversion Price” is currently equal to $1.00.
Such Series A Conversion Price, and the rate at which shares of Series A Preferred Stock may be

converted into shares of Common Stock, shall be subject to adjustment as provided in this
Section 4.

(ii) | Each share of Series B Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the
option of the holder thereof, at any time and from time to time, and without the payment of
additional consideration by the holder thereof, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable
shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing $1.35 by the Series B Conversion Price in
effect at the time of conversion. The “Series B Conversion Price” shall initially be $1.35. Such
Series B Conversion Price, and the rate at which shares of Series B Preferred Stock may be

-8-
converted into shares of Common Stock, shall be subject to adjustment as provided in this
Section 4.

(iii) In the event of a notice of redemption of any shares of Scries A
Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 6 hereof, the Conversion Rights
of the shares designated for redemption shall terminate at the close of business on the last full
day preceding the date fixed for redemption, unless the redemption price is not fully paid on such
redemption date, in which case the Conversion Rights for such shares shall continue until such
price is paid in full. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation or
a Deemed Liquidation Event, the Conversion Rights shall terminate at the close of business on
the last full day preceding the date fixed for the payment of any such amounts distributable on
such event to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock.

(b) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued
upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock. In lieu of any
fractional shares to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash
equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair market value of a share of Common Stock as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. Whether or not fractional
shares would be issuable upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total
number of shares of Preferred Stock the holder is at the time converting into Common Stock and
the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion.

(1) In order for a holder of Preferred Stock to voluntarily convert
shares of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the
certificate or certificates for such shares of Preferred Stock (or, if such registered holder alleges
that such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement
reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that
may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such
certificate), at the office of the transfer agent for the applicable series of Preferred Stock (or at
the principal office of the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent),
together with written notice that such holder elects to convert all or any number of the shares of
the Preferred Stock represented by such certificate or certificates and, if applicable, any event on
which such conversion is contingent. Such notice shall state such holder’s name or the names of
the nominees in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common
Stock to be issued. If required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall
be endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form
satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or his, her or its attorney
duly authorized in writing. The close of business on the date of receipt by the transfer agent (or
by the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent) of such certificates (or lost
certificate affidavit and agreement) and notice shall be the time of conversion (the “Conversion
Time”), and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the shares represented by
such certificate shall be deemed to be outstanding of record as of such date. The Corporation
shall, as soon as practicable after the Conversion Time, issue and deliver at such office to such
holder of Preferred Stock, or to his, her or its nominces, a certificate or certificates for the

-9-
number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled, together with cash in
lieu of any fraction of a share.

(ii) | The Corporation shall at all times when any Preferred Stock shall
be outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued stock, for the
purpose of effecting the conversion of the Preferred Stock, such number of its duly authorized
shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all
outstanding Preferred Stock; and, if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of
Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of
the Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall take such corporate action as may be necessary to
increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall
be sufficient for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain
the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to this Certificate of
Incorporation. Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment reducing either of the
Series A Conversion Price or Series B Conversion Price below the then par value of the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the applicable series of Preferred Stock, the
Corporation will take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary
in order that the Corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Common Stock at such adjusted Series A Conversion Price or Series B Conversion Price, as the
case may be.

(iii) | All shares of Preferred Stock which shall have been surrendered
for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights with
respect to such shares, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and to vote, shall
immediately cease and terminate at the Conversion Time, except only the right of the holders
thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor and to receive payment of any
dividends declared but unpaid thereon. Any shares of a series of Preferred Stock so converted
shall be retired and cancelled and shall not be reissued as shares of such series, and the
Corporation (without the need for stockholder action) may from time to time take such
appropriate action as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of such series
of Preferred Stock accordingly.

(iv) | Upon any such conversion, no adjustment to either of the Series A
Conversion Price or Series B Conversion Price shall be made for any declared but unpaid
dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, as the case may be,
surrendered for conversion or on the Common Stock delivered upon conversion.

(v) The Corporation shal! pay any and all issue and other similar taxes
that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon
conversion of shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4. The Corporation shall not,
however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in
the issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in which the
shares of Preferred Stock so converted were registered, and no such issuance or delivery shall be
made unless and until the person or entity requesting such issuance has paid to the Corporation

the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax
has been paid.

such issue or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such
record date.

(B) Ifthe terms of any Option or Convertible Security, the
issuance of which resulted in an adjustment to either of the Series A Conversion Price or Series
B Conversion Price pursuant to the terms of Subsection 4(d)(iv) below, are revised (either
automatically pursuant to the provisions contained therein or as a result of an amendment to such
terms) to provide for either (1) any increase or decrease in the number of shares of Common
Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any such Option or Convertible
Security or (2) any increase or decrease in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon
such exercise, conversion or exchange, then, effective upon such increase or decrease becoming
effective, the Series A Conversion Price or the Series B Conversion Price, as the case may be,

Securities covered by clause (IV) of Subsection 4(d)(i)(E)), the issuance of which did not result
in an adjustment to the Series A Conversion Price or the Series B Conversion Price pursuant to
the terms of Subsection 4(d)(iv) below (either because the consideration per share (determined

-13-
pursuant to Subsection 4(d)(v) hereof) of the Additional Shares of Common Stock subject
thereto was equal to or greater than the Series A Conversion Price or Series B Conversion Price,
as the case may be, then in effect, or because such Option or Convertible Security was issued

revised after the Series A Original Issue Date or Series B Original Issue Date, as the case may be
(either automatically pursuant to the provisions contained therein or as a result of an amendment
to such terms), to provide for either (1) any increase or decrease in the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any such Option or
Convertible Security or (2) any increase or decrease in the consideration payable to the
Corporation upon such exercise, conversion or exchange, then such Option or Convertible
Security, as so amended, and the Additional Shares of Common Stock subject thereto
(determined in the manner provided in Subsection 4(d)(iii)(A) above) shall be deemed to have
been issued effective upon such increase or decrease becoming effective.

(D) Upon the expiration or termination of any unexercised
Option, the Series A Conversion Price or Series B Conversion Price shall be readjusted to such
Series A Conversion Price or Series B Conversion Price, as the case may be, as would have
obtained had such Option never been issued.

immediately prior to such issue, then the Series A Conversion Price shall be reduced,
concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent)

determined in accordance with the following formula:
CP,=CP, * (A+B)=+(A+C)

Preferred Stock) outstanding immediately prior to
such issue);

‘‘B” shall mean the number of shares of Common

Shares of Common Stock issued in such transaction.

(B) In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the
Series B Original Issue Date issue Additional Shares of Common Stock (including Additional

consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Series B Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such issue, then the Series B Conversion Price shall be reduced,
concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent)

(IV) ‘“B” shall mean the number of shares of Common

and

(V)  “C” shall mean the number of such Additional
Shares of Common Stock issued in such transaction.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this
Subsection 4(d), the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional
Shares of Common Stock shall be computed as follows:

(A) Cashand Property: Such consideration shall:

(1) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
aggregate amount of cash received by the
Corporation, excluding amounts paid or payable for
accrued interest;

(II) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair market value thereof at the
time of such issue, as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors of the Corporation; and

(III) in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock
are issued together with other shares or securities or
other assets of the Corporation for consideration
which covers both, be the proportion of such
consideration so received, computed as provided in

(vi) Multiple Closing Dates. In the event the Corporation shall issue on
more than one date Additional Shares of Common Stock that are a part of one transaction or a
series of related transactions and that would result in an adjustment to the Series A Conversion
Price or Series B Conversion Price, as the case may be, pursuant to the terms of Subsection
4(d)(iv) above, then, upon the final such issuance, the Series A Conversion Price or Series B
Conversion Price, as the case may be, shall be readjusted to give effect to all such issuances as if
they occurred on the date of the first such issuance (and without giving effect to any additional
adjustments as a result of such subsequent issuances within such period).

(e) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If the Corporation shall at
any time or from time to time after the Series B Original Issue Date effect a subdivision of the

outstanding Common Stock without a comparable subdivision of the Series A Preferred Stock or
Series B Preferred Stock, as the case may be, or combine the outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, as the case may be, without a comparable
combination of the Common Stock, the Series A Conversion Price and/or Series B Conversion
Price, as the case may be, in effect immediately before that subdivision or combination shall be
proportionately decreased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion
of cach share of such series shall be increased in proportion to such increase in the aggregate
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. If the Corporation shall at any time or from
time to time after the Series B Original Issue Date combine the outstanding shares of Common
Stock without a comparable combination of the Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred
Stock or effect a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B

-17-
Preferred Stock without a comparable subdivision of the Common Stock, the Series A
Conversion Price and/or Series B Conversion Price, as the case may be, in effect immediately
before the combination or subdivision shall be proportionately increased so that the number of
shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be decreased
in proportion to such decrease in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding.
Any adjustment under this subsection shall become effective at the close of business on the date
the subdivision or combination becomes effective.

(f) Adjustment for Certain Dividends and Distributions. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Series B Original Issue Date shall make or
issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive,
a dividend or other distribution payable on the Common Stock in additional shares of Common
Stock, then and in each such event the Series A Conversion Price and Series B Conversion Price
in effect immediately before such event shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance or, in
the event such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record
date, by multiplying the Series A Conversion Price or the Series B Conversion Price, as the case
may be, then in effect by a fraction:

(1) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such
issuance or the close of business on such record date, and

(2) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such
issuance or the close of business on such record date plus the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution;

provided, however, that if such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend is not fully
paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the Series A Conversion
Price and the Series B Conversion Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of
business on such record date and thereafter the Series A Conversion Price and the Series B
Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this subsection as of the time of actual payment of
such dividends or distributions; and provided further, however, that no such adjustment shall be
made with respect to the Series A Conversion Price or the Series B Conversion Price under this
Subsection 4(f) if the holders of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, as the case
may be, simultaneously receive (i) a dividend or other distribution of shares of Common Stock in
a number equal to the number of shares of Common Stock as they would have received if all
outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, as the case may be,
had been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event or (ii) a dividend or other
distribution of shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, as the case may
be, which are convertible, as of the date of such event, into such number of shares of Common
Stock as is equal to the number of additional shares of Common Stock being issued with respect
to each share of Common Stock in such dividend or distribution.

(g) Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Series B Original Issue Date shall make or

-18-
issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive,
a dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the Corporation (other than a distribution
of shares of Common Stock in respect of outstanding shares of Common Stock) or in other
property and the provisions of Section 1 do not apply to such dividend or distribution, then and
in cach such event the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock shal]
receive, simultaneously with the distribution to the holders of Common Stock, a dividend or
other distribution of such securities or other property in an amount equal to the amount of such
securities or other property as they would have received if all outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, as the case may be, had been converted into
Common Stock on the date of such event.

(h) Adjustment for Merger or Reorganization, etc. Subject to the provisions
of Subsection 2(c), if there shall occur any reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,

consolidation or merger involving the Corporation in which the Common Stock (but not either
the Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock) is converted into or exchanged for
securities, cash or other property (other than a transaction covered by Subsections (e), (f) or (g)
of this Section 4), then, following any such reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
consolidation or merger, each share of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, as
the case may be, shall thereafter be convertible in lieu of the Common Stock into which it was
convertible prior to such event into the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property
which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation issuable upon
conversion of one share of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, as the case may
be, immediately prior to such reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or
merger would have been entitled to receive pursuant to such transaction; and, in such case,
appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation) shall be made in the application of the provisions in this Section 4 with respect to
the rights and interests thereafter of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock or Series B
Preferred Stock, as the case may be, to the end that the provisions set forth in this Section 4
(including provisions with respect to changes in and other adjustments of the Series A
Conversion Price or the Series B Conversion Price) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as
reasonably may be, in relation to any securities or other property thereafter deliverable upon the
conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, as the case may be.

(i) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Series A Conversion Price or Series B Conversion Price pursuant to this
Section 4, the Corporation at its expense shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable but in any
event not later than 10 days thereafter, compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance
with the terms hereof and furnish to each holder of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B
Preferred Stock, as the case may be, a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment
(including the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property into which the Series A
Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, as the case may be, is convertible) and showing in
detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the written request at any time of any holder of Series A
Preferred Stock of Series B Preferred Stock (but in any event not later than 10 days thereafter),
furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a certificate setting forth (i) the Series A

-19-
Conversion Price and the Series B Conversion Price then in effect, and (ii) the number of shares
of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other securities, cash or property which then would
be received upon the conversion of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock.

(j) Notice of Record Date. In the event:

(i) the Corporation shall take a record of the holders of its Common
Stock (or other stock or securities at the time issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred
Stock and Series B Preferred Stock) for the purpose of entitling or enabling them to receive any
dividend or other distribution, or to receive any right to subscribe for or purchase any shares of
stock of any class or any other securities, or to receive any other right; or

(ii) | of any capital reorganization of the Corporation, any
reclassification of the Common Stock of the Corporation, or any Deemed Liquidation Event; or

(iii) | of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-
up of the Corporation,

then, and in each such case, the Corporation will send or cause to be sent to the holders of the
Preferred Stock a notice specifying, as the case may be, (i) the record date for such dividend,
distribution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right, or (ii)
the effective date on which such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer,
dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is proposed to take place, and the time, if any is to be
fixed, as of which the holders of record of Common Stock (or such other stock or securities at
the time issuable upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred

securities) for securities or other property deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification,
consolidation, merger, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, and the amount per share
and character of such exchange applicable to the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred
Stock and the Common Stock. Such notice shall be sent at least 10 days prior to the record date

a firm commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, resulting in at least $20,000,000 of net proceeds to
the Corporation or (ii) a date specified by vote or written consent of the holders of at least two-

closing or such vote or written consent, the “Mandatory Conversion Date”), (A) all outstanding

-20-
shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted
into shares of Common Stock, at the then effective conversion rate and (B) such shares may not
be reissued by the Corporation as shares of such series.

(b) All holders of record of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B
Preferred Stock shall be given written notice of the Mandatory Conversion Date and the place
designated for mandatory conversion of all such shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B
Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 5. Such notice need not be given in advance of the
occurrence of the Mandatory Conversion Date. Such notice shall be sent by first class or
registered mail, postage prepaid, or given by electronic communication in compliance with the
provisions of the General Corporation Law, to each record holder of Series A Preferred Stock
and/or Series B Preferred Stock. Upon receipt of such notice, each holder of shares of Series A
Preferred Stock and/or Series B Preferred Stock shall surrender his, her or its certificate or
certificates for all such shares to the Corporation at the place designated in such notice, and shall
thereafter receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to this Section 5. On the Mandatory Conversion Date, all outstanding shares of
Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have been converted
into shares of Common Stock, which shall be deemed to be outstanding of record, and all nights
with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock so converted, including
the rights, if any, to receive notices and vote (other than as a holder of Common Stock), will
terminate, except only the rights of the holders thereof, upon surrender of their certificate or
certificates therefor, to receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which
such Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock has been converted, and payment of
any declared but unpaid dividends thereon. If so required by the Corporation, certificates
surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by written instrument or
instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered
holder or by his, her or its attorney duly authorized in writing. As soon as practicable after the
Mandatory Conversion Date and the surrender of the certificate or certificates for Series A
Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall cause to be issued and
delivered to such holder, or on his, her or its written order, a certificate or certificates for the
number of full shares of Common Stock issuable on such conversion in accordance with the
provisions hereof and cash as provided in Subsection 4(b) in respect of any fraction of a share of
Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion.

(c) All certificates evidencing shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B
Preferred Stock which are required to be surrendered for conversion in accordance with the
provisions hereof shall, from and after the Mandatory Conversion Date, be deemed to have been
retired and cancelled and the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock
represented thereby converted into Common Stock for all purposes, notwithstanding the failure
of the holder or holders thereof to surrender such certificates on or prior to such date. Such
converted Series A Preferred Stock and Scries B Preferred Stock may not be reissued as shares
of such series, and the Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate action (without the need
for stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of
Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock accordingly.

Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock determined by dividing (i) the total
number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, as the case may be,
outstanding immediately prior to such Redemption Date by (ii) the number of remaining
Redemption Dates (including the Redemption Date to which such calculation applies). Ifthe
Corporation does not have sufficient funds legally available to redeem on any Redemption Date
all shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and of any other class or series
of stock to be redeemed on such Redemption Date, the Corporation shall redeem a pro rata
portion of each holder’s redeemable shares of such stock out of funds legally available therefor,
based on the respective amounts which would otherwise be payable in respect of the shares to be
redeemed if the legally available funds were sufficient to redeem all such shares, and shall
redeem the remaining shares to have been redeemed as soon as practicable after the Corporation
has funds legally available therefor.

(b) Redemption Notice. Written notice of the mandatory redemption (the
“Redemption Notice’) shall be mailed, postage prepaid, to each holder of record of Series A
Preferred Stock and/or Series B Preferred Stock, at its post office address last shown on the

Corporation, in the manner and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice, and thereupon
the applicable Redemption Price for such shares shall be payable to the order of the person
whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof, and each surrendered
certificate shall be canceled and retired. In the event less than all of the shares of Series A
Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock represented by a certificate are redeemed, a new
certificate representing the unredeemed shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred
Stock, as the case may be, shall promptly be issued to such holder.

(d) Rights Subsequent to Redemption. If the Redemption Notice shall have
been duly given, and if on the applicable Redemption Date the applicable Redemption Price
payable upon redemption of the shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such Redemption
Date is paid or tendered for payment or deposited with an independent payment agent so as to be
available therefor, then notwithstanding that the certificates evidencing any of the shares of
Series A Preferred Stock and/or Series B Preferred Stock so called for redemption shall not have
been surrendered, dividends with respect to such shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B
Preferred Stock shall cease to accrue after such Redemption Date and all rights with respect to

prohibits the elimination or limitation of liability of directors for breaches of fiduciary duty, no
director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for
monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director, notwithstanding any provision
of law imposing such liability. No amendment to or repeal of this provision shall apply to or
have any effect on the liability or alleged liability of any director of the Corporation for or with
respect to any acts or omissions of such director occurring prior to such amendment.

EIGHTH: The Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Section 145 of the
General Corporation Law, as amended from time to time, indemnify each person who was or is a
party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he
or she is or was, or has agreed to become, a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was
serving, or has agreed to serve, at the request of the Corporation, as a director, officer, partner,
employee or trustee of, or in a similar capacity with, another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan) (all such persons being
referred to hereafter as an “Indemnitee”), or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken
or omitted in such capacity, against all expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and
amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of an Indemnitee in
connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom.
As a condition precedent to an Indemnitee’s right to be indemnified, the Indemnitee must
notify the Corporation in writing as soon as practicable of any action, suit, proceeding or
investigation involving such Indemnitee for which indemnity will or could be sought. With
respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation of which the Corporation is so notified,
the Corporation will be entitled to participate therein at its own expense and/or to assume the
defense thereof at its own expense, with legal counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee.

In the event that the Corporation does not assume the defense of any action, suit,
proceeding or investigation of which the Corporation receives notice under this Article, the
Corporation shall pay in advance of the final disposition of such matter any expenses (including
attorneys’ fees) incurred by an Indemnitee in defending a civil or criminal action, suit,
proceeding or investigation or any appeal therefrom; provided, however, that the payment of
such expenses incurred by an Indemnitee in advance of the final disposition of such matter shall
be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay all
amounts so advanced in the event that it shall ultimately be determined that the Indemnitee is not
entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article, which undertaking
shall be accepted without reference to the financial ability of the Indemnitee to make such
repayment; and further provided that no such advancement of expenses shall be made under this
Article if it is determined that (i) the Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner he
reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, or (ii) with
respect to any criminal action or proceeding, the Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe his
conduct was unlawful.

The Corporation shall not indemnify an Indemnitee pursuant to this Article in connection
with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such Indemnitee unless the initiation thereof was
approved by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. In addition, the Corporation shall not
indemnify an Indemnitee to the extent such Indemnitee is reimbursed from the proceeds of
insurance, and in the event the Corporation makes any indemnification payments to an
Indemnitee and such Indemnitee is subsequently reimbursed from the proceeds of insurance,
such Indemnitee shall promptly refund such indemnification payments to the Corporation to the
extent of such insurance reimbursement.

All determinations hereunder as to the entitlement of an Indemnitee to indemnification or
advancement of expenses shall be made in each instance (a) by a majority vote of the directors of
the Corporation consisting of persons who are not at that time parties to the action, suit or
proceeding in question (“disinterested directors”), whether or not a quorum, (b) by a committee
of disinterested directors designated by majority vote of disinterested directors, whether or not a
quorum, (c) if there are no disinterested directors, or if the disinterested directors so direct, by
independent legal counsel (who may, to the extent permitted by law, be regular legal counsel to
the Corporation) in a written opinion, or (d) by the stockholders of the Corporation.

The nights provided in this Article (i) shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to
which an Indemnitee may be entitled under any law, agreement or vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise, and (ii) shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and
administrators of the Indemnitees. The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to
time by its Board of Directors, grant indemnification rights to other employees or agents of the

-25-
Corporation or other persons serving the Corporation and such rights may be equivalent to, or
greater or less than, those set forth in this Article.

NINTH: The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any
provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter
prescribed by statute and this Certificate of Incorporation, and all rights conferred upon
stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.
