Proceeds, before any payment is made to the holders of Common Stock by reason of their
ownership thereof, an amount equal to (a) $0.4619 per share of Series A Preferred (subject to

Preferred, Series D Preferred and Series E Preferred the full amount of the Series A Liquidation
Amount, the Series B Liquidation Amount, the Series C Liquidation Amount, the Series D
Liquidation Amount and the Series E Liquidation Amount, respectively, plus any declared but
unpaid dividends thereon, then all Distributable Proceeds shall be distributed ratably among the
holders of Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred, Series C Preferred, Series D Preferred and
Series E Preferred in proportion to the preferential amount each such holder otherwise would
have been entitled to receive under this Section 2(ayi).

(ii) Upon the completion of the distributions to the holders of Preferred Stock
as described above, the remaining Distributable Proceeds shall be distributed among the holders
of Common Stock pro rata based on the number of shares of Common Stock held by each.
Nothing contained in this Section 2 shail limit the right of holders of Preferred Stock to convert
their shares into Class B Common Stock at any time prior to or simultaneously with the closing
of a Liquidation Event, provided that shares of Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to be
converted into shares of Class B Common Stock jn order to participate in any Liquidation Event,
or seri¢s of Liquidation Events, as shares of Class B Common Stock, without first foregoing
participation in the Liquidation Event, or series of Liquidation Events, as shares of Preferred
Stock.

(ili) | Notwithstanding the above, for purposes of determining the amount each
holder of shares of Preferred Stock is entitled to receive with respect to a Liquidation Event, each
such holder of shares of a series of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have converted
(regardless of whether such holder actually converted) such holder’s shares of such series into
shares of Class B Common Stock immediately prior to the Liquidation Event if, as a result of an
actual conversion, such holder would receive, in the aggregate, an amount greater than the
amount that would be distributed to such holder if such holder did not convert such series of
Preferred Stock into shares of Class B Common Stock. If any such holder shall be deemed to
have converted shares of Preferred Stock into Class B Common Stock pursuant to this paragraph,
then such holder shall not be entitled to receive any distribution that would otherwise be made to
holders of Preferred Stock that have not converted (or have not been deemed to have converted)
into shares of Class B Common Stock,

(b) Liquidation Events

(i) Definition. For purposes of this Section 2, a “Liquidation Event” shall
mean: (A) the closing of the sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially alt of the
Corporation’s assets on a consolidated basis (including an exclusive license with respect to all or
substantially all of the Corporation’s intellectual property); (B) the consummation of a merger,
share exchange or consolidation of the Corporation with or into another entity (except one in
which the holders of capital stock of the Corporation as constituted immediately prior to such
merger, share exchange or consolidation continue to hold, in substantially the same relative
proportions, and with substantially the same Rights and Preferences, a majority of the voting
power of the capital stock of the Corporation or the surviving or acquiring entity (or its parent
entity)); (C) the transfer (whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise), in one transaction or a
series of related transactions, to a person or group of affiliated persons (other than an underwriter
of the Corporation’s securities), of capital stock of the Corporation if, after such transfer, such
person or group of affiliated persons would hold 50% or more of the voting power of the capital
stock of the Corporation (or the surviving or acquiring entity); or (D) a liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation (whether voluntary or involuntary). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any transaction or event otherwise constituting a Liquidation Event under this
paragraph shall be deemed to be exempt from such definition if each of (i) the holders of a
majority of the then outstanding Preferred Stock (voting together as a single voting group and
not as separate series on an As Converted Basis), (ii) the holders of a majority of the then
outstanding Series D Preferred Stock, voting as a separate series, and (iii) the holders of a
majority of the then outstanding Series E Preferred Stock, voting as a separate series, so agree by
prior vote or written consent. If any portion of the consideration payable to the shareholders of
the Corporation is placed into escrow and/or is payable to the holders of the Corporation’s
capital stock only upon satisfaction of contingencies, the applicable merger agreement shall
provide that (a) the portion of such consideration that is not placed in escrow and not subject to
any contingencies (the “Initial Consideration”) shall be allocated among the holders of capital
stock of the Corporation in accordance with this Section 2 as if the Initial Consideration were the
only consideration payable in connection with such Liquidation Event; and (b) any additional
consideration which becomes payable to the hotders of capital stock of the Corporation upon
release from escrow or satisfaction of such contingencies shall be allocated among the holders of
capital stock of the Corporation in accordance Section 2 after taking into account the previous
payment of the Initial Consideration as part of the same transaction.

(ii) Valuation of Consideration. If the consideration received in a
Liquidation Event ts other than cash, its value will be deemed its fair market value as determined
in good faith by the Board. Any securities shall be valued as follows:

(A) Securities not subject to investment Jetter or other similar
restrictions on free marketability:

(1) If traded on a securities exchange or a national quotation
system, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such
exchange or quotation system over the twenty trading-day period ending on the third trading day
prior to the closing;

4.
LEGAL126416172.13

(2) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the
twenty trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to the closing; and

(3) If there is no active public market, the value shall be the
fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Board and the holders of a majority of
the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (voting together as a single voting group and not
as separate series on an As Converted Basis).

(B) The method of valuation of securities subject to investment letter
or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of a
shareholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate} shall include an appropriate discount from
the market value determined as above in Section 2(b)(ii)(A) to reflect the approximate fair
market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board.

(C) The foregoing methods for valuing non-cash consideration to be
distributed in connection with a Liquidation Event shall, upon approval by the Corporation’s
shareholders of the definitive agreements governing a Liquidation Event in accordance with
Section 4(a) and, to the extent required, Section 4{c), be superseded by any determination of such
value set forth in the definitive agreements governing such Liquidation Event.

Stock into Class B Common Stock as provided in this Section 3.

(a) Voluntary Conversion

of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share, at the office of the

nonassessable shares of Class B Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Liquidation
Amount for that series of Preferred Stock by the Applicable Conversion Price (as defined below)
for that series of Preferred Stock in effect on the effective date of such conversion, as determined
below. The initial Series A Preferred Conversion Price as of the date upon which these
Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation are accepted for filing by the Secretary of State
of the State of Washington (the “Filing Date”) shall be equal to the Series A Liquidation
Amount (the “Series A Conversion Price”), the initial Series B Preferred Conversion Price as of

LEGAL126416172.13

(b) Automatic Conversion

Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of Class B
Common Stock at the Applicable Conversion Price at the time in effect for such share
immediately upon the earlier of (i) the date specified by the affirmative vote or consent of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (voting together as a single
voting group and not as separate series on an As Converted Basis), and (ii) the effective date of
the registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”),
with respect to a firm commitment underwritten public offering of the Corporation’s Class A
Common Stock, provided that (A) the gross public offering price to the public of such offering is
not less than $30,000,000 and (B) the Class A Common Stock is listed for trading on a Securities
Exchange (a “Qualified Public Offering’), Notwithstanding the forgoing, (x) no shares of
Series D Preferred shall be converted into shares of Class B Common Stock pursuant to clause
(i) of this Section 3(b) unless such conversion is approved by the affirmative vote or consent of
the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series D Preferred and (y) no shares of
Series E Preferred shall be converted into shares of Class B Common Stock pursuant to clause (i)
of this Section 3(b) unless such conversion is approved by the affirmative vote or consent of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series E Preferred,

(c) Mechanics of Conversion

Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert such shares into shares
of Class B Common Stock under Section 3(a) above, such holder shall (i) either (A) surrender
the certificate or certificates for the shares to be converted, duly endorsed, at the office of the
Corporation or of any transfer agent for such series of Preferred Stock, or (B) notify the
Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been Jost, stolen or destroyed and
execute an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any lo ss
incurred by it in connection with such certificates, and (ii) give written notice to the Corporation
at its principal corporate office of the election to convert such shares and shall state therein the
name or names in which the certificate or certificates for the shares of Class B Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion are to be issued. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable
thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or
nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Class B
Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled upon such conversion. Such conversion
shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date on
which the requirements of the first sentence of this paragraph have been satisfied with respect to
the shares of such series of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to
receive the shares of Class B Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for
all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Class B Common Stock as of such
date, In connection with any automatic conversion of Preferred Stock under Section 3(b) above,
such conversion shall be deemed effective with respect to all shares of such Preferred Stock so
converted as of the effective date of the vote or consent referred to in clause (i) of such
subsection or the effective date of the Qualified Public Offering registration statement referred to
in clause (ii} of such subsection; provided, however, that if the automatic conversion is in
connection with a Qualified Public Offering, the conversion may, at the option of any holder
tendering such Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the
underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to such Qualified Public Offering, in which event

-6-
LEGAL 126416172,13

the person(s) entitled to receive the shares of Class B Common Stock issuable upon conversion
of such Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until
immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities. The Corporation shall, as soon as
practicable after the effective date of any automatic conversion, issue and deliver, at the
Corporation’s principal corporate office, to each holder of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or
nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Class B
Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled upon such conversion, subject to any such
holder first providing to the Corporation the documentation referred to in clauses (i)(A) or (3)(B

of this paragraph. The person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Class B Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of
such shares of Class B Common Stock as of the effective date of conversion as provided above.

(d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock for Certain Dilutive
Issuances, Splits and Combinations

The Applicable Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock shall be subject to
adjustment from time to time as follows:

(i) Issuance of Additional Stock below Purchase Price. If the Corporation
shall issue, after the first issuance of shares of Series E Preferred (the “Purchase Date”), any
Additional Stock (as defined below) for a consideration per share less than the Applicable
Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to the issuance of
such Additional Stock, then, in each such case, the Applicable Conversion Price for such series
of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such issuance shall automatically be adjusted as
set forth in this Section 3(d)(i), untess otherwise provided in this Section 3(d)(i).

(A) Adjustment Formula. Whenever the Applicable Conversion
Price for a given series of Preferred Stock is adjusted pursuant to this Section 3(d)(i), the new
Applicable Conversion Price shall be determined by multiplying the Applicable Conversion
Price in effect immediately prior to the issuance of Additional Stock by a fraction, (x) the
numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (or deemed to
be outstanding pursuant to Section 3¢d)(i)(E) below) immediately prior to such issuance (the
“Outstanding Common”) plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate
consideration received by the Corporation for such issuance would purchase at such Applicable
Conversion Price; and (y) the denominator of which shal! be the number of shares of
Outstanding Common plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock.

(B) Definition of Additional Stock. For purposes of this
Section 3(d)(i), “Additional Stock” shall mean any shares of Common Stock issued (or deemed
to have been issued pursuant to Section 3(d)(i)(E)) by the Corporation after the Purchase Date,
other than: ;

(1) | Common Stock issued pursuant to a transaction described

in Section 3(d)(ii) hereof; ,

by the Board, including the affirmative vote or consent of a majority of the Preferred Directors;

(4) Capital stock, or options or warrants to purchase capital
stock, issued in connection with commercial credit arrangements, equipment financings, or
similar transactions, plans or arrangements, provided that such transactions, plans or
arrangements are (A) effected primarily for purposes other than raising equity capital and (B)
approved by the Board, including the affirmative vote or consent of a majority of the Preferred
Directors;

(5) Common Stock actually issued upon conversion of
Preferred Stock (excluding shares of Common Stock deemed issued pursuant to Section
3(d)(xiE); .

(6) Class A Common Stock issued or issuable upon conversion
of Class B Common Stock;

(7) Common Steck issued or issuable in a Qualified Public
Offering;

(8) Capital stock actually issued upon exercise of options or
warrants or capital stock actually issued upon the conversion or exchange of convertible notes of
the Corporation outstanding as of the Purchase Date, in each case provided such issuance is
pursuant to the terms of such option, warrant or convertible note; or

(9) Capital stock, or options or warrants to purchase capital
stock, issued in connection with strategic collaborations, development agreements, licensing
transactions or similar transactions, plans or arrangements, provided that such transactions, plans
or arrangements are (A) effected primarily for purposes other than raising equity capital and (B)
approved by the Board, including the affirmative vote or consent of a majority of the Preferred
Directors.

(C) No Fractional Adjustments, No adjustment of the Applicable
Conversion Price for a series of Preferred Stock shall be made in an amount less than one
hundredth of a cent per share, provided that any adjustments that are not required to be made by
reason of this sentence shall be carried forward and shall be either taken into account in any
subsequent adjustment made prior to three years from the date of the event giving rise to the
adjustment being carried forward, or shall be made at the end of three years from the date of the
event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward.

(D) Determination of Consideration. In the case of the issuance of
Common Stock for cash, the consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid
therefor before deducting any reasonable discounts, commissions, compensations or concessions
allowed, paid or incurred by the Corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection

-8-
LEGAL126416172.13

with the issuance and sale thereof and without deductions of any other expenses paid by the
Corporation, In the case of the issuance of Common Stock for a consideration in whole or in
part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be deemed to be the fair value
thereof as determined in good faith by the Board irrespective of any accounting treatment.

(E) Deemed Issuances of Common Stock. In the case of the issuance
of options or warrants to purchase, or other rights to subscribe for, shares of Common Stock,
securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock (other than Class B

were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the manner
provided in Section 3(d)(i)(D)), if any, received by the Corporation upon the issuance of such
options, warrants or rights plus the minimum exercise price provided in such options, warrants or
rights (without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) for the Common Stock
covered thereby.

(2) The aggregate maximum number of shares of Common
Stock deliverable upon conversion of or in exchange (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions
to convertibility or exchangeability, including, without limitation, the passage of time, but

exchangeable securities, or upon the exercise of options or warrants to purchase, or other rights
to subscribe for, such convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or
exchange thereof shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or
such options, warrants or rights were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration, if
any, received by the Corporation for any such securities and related options, warrants or rights
(excluding any cash received on account of accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the
minimum additional consideration, if any, to be received by the Corporation (without taking into
account potential antidilution adjustments) upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or

(3) (In the event of any change in the number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon exercise of
such options, warrants or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such convertible or
exchangeable securities, including without limitation a change resulting from the antidilution
provisions thereof, the Applicable Conversion Price for each affected series of Preferred Stock,
to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, warrants, rights or
securities, shall be recomputed to reflect such change, but no further adjustment shall be made

for the actual issuance of Common Stock or any payment of such consideration upon the
exercise of any such options, warrants or rights or the conversion or exchange of such securities.

(4) | Upon the expiration of any such options, warrants or rights,
the termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options,
warrants or rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Applicable
Conversion Price for each affected series of Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected by
or computed using such options, warrants, rights or securities or options, warrants or rights
related to such securities, shall be recomputed to reflect the issuance of only the number of
shares of Common Stock (and convertible or exchangeable securities which remain in effect)
actually issued upon the exercise of such options, warrants or rights, upon the conversion or
exchange of such securities or upon the exercise of the options, warrants or rights related to such
securities.

(5) The number of shares of Common Stock deemed issued
and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to Sections 3(d)(iME)(1) and 3(d\(i)(E)(2)
shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or expiration of the type

described in either Section 3(d)(i)EX3) or 3(d)G)(EX(4).

(F) No Increased Conversion Price. Notwithstanding any other
provisions of this Section 3(d)(j), except to the limited extent provided for in
Sections 3()()(E3) and 3(d)(i{E)(4), no adjustment of the Applicable Conversion Price of any
series of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 3(d)(i) shall have the effect of increasing any
such Applicable Conversion Price.

(G) Waiver of Adjustment. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, any downward adjustment of the Applicable Conversion Price of any series of
Preferred Stock may be waived, either prospectively or retroactively and either generally or in a
particular instance, by the consent or vote of (1) the holders of a majority of the outstanding

Stock (hereinafter referred to as “Class B Common Stock Equivalents”) without payment of
any consideration by such holder for the additional shares of Class B Common Stock or the Class

as described above, the remaining Distributable Proceeds shall be distributed among the holders
of Common Stock pro rata based on the number of shares of Common Stock held by each.
Nothing contained in this Section 2 shall limit the right of holders of Preferred Stock to convert
their shares into Class B Common Stock at any time prior to or simultaneously with the closing
of a Liquidation Event, provided that shares of Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to be
converted into shares of Class B Common Stock in order to participate in any Liquidation Event,
or series of Liquidation Events, as shares of Class B Common Stock, without first foregoing
participation in the Liquidation Event, or series of Liquidation Events, as shares of Preferred
Stock.

(iii) | Notwithstanding the above, for purposes of determining the amount each
holder of shares of Preferred Stock is entitled to receive with respect to a Liquidation Event, each
such holder of shares of a series of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have converted
(regardless of whether such holder actually converted) such holder’s shares of such series into
shares of Class B Common Stock tmmediately prior to the Liquidation Event if, as a result of an
actual conversion, such holder would receive, in the aggregate, an amount greater than the
amount that would be distributed to such holder if such holder did not convert such series of
Preferred Stock into shares of Class B Common Stock. If any such holder shall be deemed to
have converted shares of Preferred Stock into Class B Common Stock pursuant to this paragraph,
then such holder shall not be entitled to receive any distribution that would otherwise be made to
holders of Preferred Stock that have not converted (or have not been deemed to have converted)
into shares of Class B Common Stock.

mean: (A) the closing of the sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the
Corporation’s assets on a consolidated basis (including an exclusive license with respect to all or
substantially all of the Corporation’s intellectual property); (B) the consummation of a merger,
share exchange or consolidation of the Corporation with or into another entity (except one in
which the holders of capital stock of the Corporation as constituted immediately prior to such
merger, share exchange or consolidation continue to hold, in substantially the same relative
proportions, and with substantially the same Rights and Preferences, a majority of the voting
power of the capital stock of the Corporation or the surviving or acquiring entity (or its parent
entity)); (C) the transfer (whether by merger, consotidation or otherwise), in one transaction or a
series of related transactions, to a person or group of affiliated persons (other than an underwriter
of the Corporation’s securities), of capital stock of the Corporation if, after such transfer, such
person or group of affiliated persons would hold 50% or more of the voting power of the capital
stock of the Corporation (or the surviving or acquiring entity); or (D) a liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation (whether voluntary or involuntary). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any transaction or event otherwise constituting a Liquidation Event under this
paragraph shall be deemed to be exempt from such definition if each of (i) the holders of a
majority of the then outstanding Preferred Stock (voting together as a single voting group and
not as separate series on an As Converted Basis), (ii) the holders of a majority of the then
outstanding Series D Preferred Stock, voting as a separate series, and (iii) the holders of a
majority of the then outstanding Series E Preferred Stock, voting as a separate series, so agree by
prior vote or written consent. If any portion of the consideration payable to the shareholders of
the Corporation is placed into escrow and/or is payable to the holders of the Corporation’s
capital stock only upon satisfaction of contingencies, the applicable merger agreement shall
provide that (a) the portion of such consideration that is not placed in escrow and not subject to
any contingencies (the “Initial Consideration”) shall be allocated among the holders of capital
stock of the Corporation in accordance with this Section 2 as if the Initial Consideration were the
only consideration payable in connection with such Liquidation Event; and (b) any additional
consideration which becomes payable to the holders of capital stock of the Corporation upon
release from escrow or satisfaction of such contingencies shall be allocated among the holders of
capital stock of the Corporation in accordance Section 2 after taking into account the previous
payment of the Initial Consideration as part of the same transaction.

(ii) Valuation of Consideration, If the consideration received in a
Liquidation Event is other than cash, its value will be deemed its fair market value as determined
in good faith by the Board. Any securities shall be valued as follows:

(A) Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar
restrictions on free marketability:

(1) If traded on a securities exchange or a national quotation
system, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such
exchange or quotation system over the twenty trading-day period ending on the third trading day
prior to the closing;

LEGAL326416] 72.13

(2) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the
twenty trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to the closing; and

(3) If there is no active public market, the value shall be the
fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Board and the holders of a majority of

the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (voting together as a single voting group and not *

as separate series on an As Converted Basis).

(B) The method of valuation of securities subject to investment tetter
or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of a
shareholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall include an appropriate discount from
the market value determined as above in Section 2(b)(ii)(A) to reflect the approximate fair
market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board.

{C) The foregoing methods for valuing non-cash consideration to be
distributed in connection with a Liquidation Event shall, upon approval by the Corporation’s
shareholders of the definitive agreements governing a Liquidation Event in accordance with
Section 4(a) and, to the extent required, Section 4(c), be superseded by any determination of such

of Class B Common Stock under Section 3(a) above, such holder shall (i) either (A) surrender
the certificate or certificates for the shares to be converted, duly endorsed, at the office of the
Corporation or of any transfer agent for such series of Preferred Stock, or (B) notify the
Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and
execute an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any lo ss
incurred by it in connection with such certificates, and (ii) give written notice to the Corporation
at its principal corporate office of the election to convert such shares and shall state therein the
name or names in which the certificate or certificates for the shares of Class B Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion are to be issued. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable
thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or
nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Class B
Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled upon such conversion. Such conversion
shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date on
which the requirements of the first sentence of this paragraph have been satisfied with respect to
the shares of such series of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to
receive the shares of Class B Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for
all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Class B Common Stock as of such
date, In connection with any automatic conversion of Preferred Stock under Section 3(b) above,
such conversion shall be deemed effective with respect to all shares of such Preferred Stock so
converted as of the effective date of the vote or consent referred to in clause (i) of such
subsection or the effective date of the Qualified Public Offering registration statement referred to
in clause (ii) of such subsection; provided, however, that if the automatic conversion is in
connection with a Qualified Public Offering, the conversion may, at the option of any holder
tendering such Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the
underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to such Qualified Public Offering, in which event

LEGAL 126416172.13

the person(s) entitled to receive the shares of Class B Common Stock issuable upon conversion
of such Preferred Stock shatl not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until
immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities. The Corporation shall, as soon as
practicable after the effective date of any automatic conversion, issue and deliver, at the
Corporation’s principal corporate office, to each holder of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or
nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Class B
Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled upon such conversion, subject to any such
holder first providing to the Corporation the documentation referred to in clauses (i)(A) or (i)(B)
"of this paragraph. The person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Class B Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of
such shares of Class B Common Stock as of the effective date of conversion as provided above.

(d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock for Certain Ditutive
Issuances, Splits and Combinations

The Applicable Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock shall be subject to
adjustment from time to time as follows:

{i) Issuance of Additional Stock below Purchase Price. If the Corporation
shall issue, after the first issuance of shares of Series E Preferred (the “Purchase Date”), any
Additional Stock (as defined below) for a consideration per share less than the Applicable
Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to the issuance of
such Additional Stock, then, in each such case, the Applicable Conversion Price for such series
of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such issuance shal] automatically be adjusted as
set forth in this Section 3(d)(i), unless otherwise provided in this Section 3(d\(i).

(A) Adjustment Formula. Whenever the Applicable Conversion
Price for a given series of Preferred Stock is adjusted pursuant to this Section 3(d)(i), the new
Applicable Conversion Price shall be determined by multiplying the Applicable Conversion
Price in effect immediately prior to the issuance of Additional Stock by a fraction, (x) the
numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (or deemed to
be outstanding pursuant to Section 3(d\i)E) below) immediately prior to such issuance (the
“Outstanding Common”) plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate
consideration received by the Corporation for such issuance would purchase at such Applicable
Conversion Price; and (y) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of
Outstanding Common plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock.

(B) - Definition of Additional Stock. For purposes of this
Section 3(d){i), “Additional Stock” shall mean any shares of Common Stock issued (or deemed
to have been issued pursuant to Section 3(d)(i(E)) by the Corporation after the Purchase Date,
other than:

(1) Common Stock issued pursuant to a transaction described

in Section 3(d)}(ii) hereof;

(2) Capital stock, or warrants or options to purchase capital
stock, issued to employees, directors, consultants or other service providers of the Corporation

(3) Capital stock, or warrants or options to purchase capital
stock, issued in connection with bona fide acquisitions, mergers or similar transactions approved
by the Board, including the affirmative vote or consent of a majority of the Preferred Directors;

(4) Capital stock, or options or warrants to purchase capital
stock, issued in connection with commercial credit arrangements, equipment financings, or
similar transactions, plans or arrangements, provided that such transactions, plans or
arrangements are (A) effected primarily for purposes other than raising equity capital and (B)
approved by the Board, including the affirmative vote or consent of a majority of the Preferred
Directors;

(5) Common Stock actually issued upon conversion of
Preferred Stock (excluding shares of Common Stock deemed issued pursuant to Section

3(d)(xIM{E);

(6) Class A Common Stock issued or issuable upon conversion
of Class B Common Stock;

(7) Common Stock issued or issuable in a Qualified Public
Offering:

(8) Capital stock actually issued upon exercise of options or
warrants or capital stock actually tssued upon the conversion or exchange of convertible notes of
the Corporation outstanding as of the Purchase Date, in each case provided such issuance is
pursuant to the terms of such option, warrant or convertible note; or

(9) Capital stock, or options or warrants to purchase capital
stock, issued in connection with strategic collaborations, development agreements, licensing
transactions or similar transactions, plans or arrangements, provided that such transactions, plans
or arrangements are (A) effected primarily for purposes other than raising equity capital and (B)
approved by the Board, including the affirmative vote or consent of a majority of the Preferred
Directors.

{(C) No Fractional Adjustments. No adjustment of the Applicable
Conversion Price for a series of Preferred Stock shall be made in an amount less than one
hundredth of a cent per share, provided that any adjustments that are not required to be made by
reason of this sentence shall be carried forward and shall be either taken into account in any
subsequent adjustment made prior to three years from the date of the event giving rise to the
adjustment being carried forward, or shall be made at the end of three years from the date of the
event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward.

(D) Determination of Consideration. In the case of the issuance of
Common Stock for cash, the consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid
therefor before deducting any reasonable discounts, commissions, compensations ot concessions
allowed, paid or incurred by the Corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection

-8-
LEGAL126416172.13

with the issuance and sale thereof and without deductions of any other expenses paid by the
Corporation. In the case of the issuance of Common Stock for a consideration in whole or in
part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be deemed to be the fair value
thereof as determined in good faith by the Board irrespective of any accounting treatment.

(E) Deemed Issuances of Common Stock. In the case of the issuance
of options or warrants to purchase, or other rights to subscribe for, shares of Common Stock,
securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock (other than Class B

were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the manner
provided in Section 3(d)(1)(D)), if any, received by the Corporation upon the issuance of such
options, warrants or rights plus the minimum exercise price provided in such options, warrants or
rights (without taking into account potential antidtlution adjustments) for the Common Stock
covered thereby.

(2) The aggregate maximum number of shares of Common
Stock deliverable upon conversion of or in exchange (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions

without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) for any such convertible or
exchangeable securities, or upon the exercise of options or warrants to purchase, or other rights
to subscribe for, such convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or
exchange thereof shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or
such options, warrants or rights were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration, if
any, received by the Corporation for any such securities and related options, warrants or rights
{excluding any cash received on account of accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the
minimum additional consideration, if any, to be received by the Corporation (without taking into
account potential antidilution adjustments) upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or

determined in the manner provided in Section 3(d)(i)(D)).

(3) In the event of any change in the number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon exercise of
such options, warrants or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such convertible or
exchangeable securities, including without limitation a change resulting from the antidilution
provisions thereof, the Applicable Conversion Price for each affected series of Preferred Stock,
to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, warrants, rights or
securities, shall be recomputed to reflect such change, but no further adjustment shall be made

for the actual issuance of Common Stock or any payment of such consideration upon the
exercise of any such options, warrants or rights or the conversion or exchange of such securities.

(4) Upon the expiration of any such options, warrants or rights,
the termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options,
warrants or rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Applicable
Conversion Price for each affected series of Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected by
or computed using such options, warrants, rights or securities or options, warrants or rights
related to such securities, shall be recomputed to reflect the issuance of only the number of
shares of Common Stock (and convertible or exchangeable securities which remain in effect)

exchange of such securities or upon the exercise of the options, warrants or rights related to such
securities,

(S) The number of shares of Common Stock deemed issued
and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to Sections 3(d)(iME)(1) and 3(d)(i)(E\(2)
shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or expiration of the type

described in either Section 3(d)(iI)(EX(3) or 3(d)(IME)(4).

provisions of this Section 3(d)(i), except to the limited extent provided for in

series of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 3(d)(i} shall have the effect of increasing any
such Applicable Conversion Price.

contrary, any downward adjustment of the Applicable Conversion Price of any series of
Preferred Stock may be waived, either prospectively or retroactively and either generally or in a

shares of Class B Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of Preferred Stock shall
