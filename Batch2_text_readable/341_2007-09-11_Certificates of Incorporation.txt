share of Series C-1 Preferred Stock and not previously paid plus (ii) the dividend payable under
Section 1(c) below. The Original Issue Price of the Series C-1 Preferred Stock shall be $1.0411
per share (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations andthe like

set forth in Section B.3 below and in addition to any other rights of holders of Series C-1.
Preferred Stock, the annual dividend rate shal! increase to twelve percent (12%) per annum as
long as such default continues. In the event the Board of Directors declares the payment of a
dividend on the Series C-1 Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of Series C-1
Accrued Dividends accrued through the date of such payment, the holders of Series C-1 -
Preferred Stock shall ratably receive such amounts that would be payable in respect of the shares
held by them upon such payment if all Series C-1 Accrued Dividends payable with respect to
said shares were paid in full until the Series C-1 Accrued Dividends for the holders of Series C-1
Preferred Stock are satisfied in full or the funds available for payments are depleted.

(b) The holders of the Series C Preferred Stock shall be entitled, when, as and
if declared by the Board of Directors, consistent with Delaware law, on each outstanding share of

Series C-1 Accrued Dividends, the “Accrued Dividends”). Holders of Series C Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to receive the Series C Accrued Dividends (A) when and if declared by the

Preferred Stock then outstanding shall first receive a dividend on each outstanding share of
Series C Preferred Stock in an amount at least equal to (i) the amount of the aggregate Series C
Accrued Dividends then accrued on such share of Series C Preferred Stock and not previously

combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like with respect to such shares). Upon the
Corporation’s default in redemption of Preferred Stock as set forth in Section B.3 below and in
addition to any other rights of holders of Series C Preferred Stock, the annual dividend rate shall
increase to twelve percent (12%) per annum as long as such default continues. In the event the
Board of Directors declares the payment of a dividend on the Series C Preferred Stock in an
amount less than the total amount of Series C Accrued Dividends accmmed through the date of
such payment, the holders of Series C Preferred Stock shall ratably receive such amounts that
would be payable in respect of the shares held by them upon such payment if all Series C
Accrued Dividends payable with respect to said shares were paid in full until the Series C
Accrued Dividends for the holders of Series C Preferred Stock are satisfied in full or the funds
available for payments are depleted.

(c) With respect to the declaration, payment and setting apart of dividends on
shares of Common Stock, other than in Common Stock, whether of cash, securities of other
persons, evidences of indebtedness, assets, Convertible Securities (as defined below), Stock
Purchase Rights (as defined below) or rights to acquire any of the above, the holders of Preferred
Stock shall be entitled to participate with the Common Stock and receive, before or at the same
time as any dividends shall be declared and paid upon or set aside for the Common Stock, the
same dividends or distributions, on an as-converted basis, as are to be distributed to the holders
of the Common Stock. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be treated for purposes of such
participation as being equal to the number of shares of Common Stock (which may be a fraction)
into which such share could then be converted. The rights of the holders of Preferred Stock with
respect to dividends of Common Stock are set forth in Section 5 hereof.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock
and Series B Preferred Stock (the “Junior Preferred’) hereby waive rights to all dividends that
have accrued with respect to such stock prior to December 15, 2006. Except as set provided in
Section B.1(c), the Junior Preferred shall not be entitled to receive any dividend out of the funds
of the Corporation in any event.

2. Preference on Liquidation

(a) Upon the occurrence of any Liquidating Event (as defined below), each
holder of Preferred Stock then outstanding shall be paid, out of the assets of the Corporation
available for distribution to its stockholders, before any payment shall be made in respect to the
Corporation’s Common Stock, an amount equal to the respective Original Issue Price (the
“Original Price”) per share of Preferred Stock then held by it, plus any declared but unpaid
dividends pursuant to Section B.1(c) for each share of Preferred Stock and, in the case of the
Series C Preferred Stock and the Series C-1 Preferred Stock, any Accrued Dividends that are
then unpaid for each share of Series C Preferred Stock and Series C-1 Preferred Stock then held

HLG: 209729 4
by such stockholder (respectively, the “Preference Amount’), subject to any stock dividend,
stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization affecting such shares. The Original Issue
Price of the Junior Preferred shall be One Dollar ($1.00) (as adjusted for any stock dividends,
combinations, splits, recapitalization and the like with regard to such shares). The holders of the
Series C-1 Preferred Stock shall ratably receive their respective Preference Amount prior to and
in preference to the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock and no distributions may be made to
any holders of the Series C Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 2(a) unless and until the
Preference Amount for the Series C-1 Preferred Stock has been paid in full. The holders of
Series C Preferred Stock shall ratably receive their respective Preference Amount prior to and in
preference to the Junior Preferred and no distributions may be made to any holders of Junior
Preferred pursuant to this Section 2(a) unless and until the Preference Amount for the Series C
Preferred Stock has been paid in full. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the amount to be
distributed to the Corporation’s stockholders upon such Liquidating Event, assuming full
exercise or conversion of all outstanding securities exercisable for or convertible into Common
Stock, would equal or exceed ten dollars ($10.00) per share of Preferred Stock for all series of
Preferred Stock, subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split,
combination or other similar recapitalization affecting such shares (“Qualifying Liquidation
Amount’), then the holders of Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to receive the Preference
Amount and shall instead receive only their ratable share of the Corporation’s assets pursuant to
Subsection 2(b) below as if such shares of Preferred Stock had been converted voluntarily into
Common Stock at the then applicable conversion rate immediately prior to such Liquidating
Event.

(b) Whitten notice of any such Liquidating Event stating a payment date, the
place where such payment shall be made, the amount of each payment in liquidation and the
amount of dividends to be paid shall be given by first class mail, postage prepaid, not less than
thirty (30) days prior to the payment date stated therein, to each holder of record of the Preferred
Stock at such holder’s address as shown in the records of the Corporation, provided that any
holder of Preferred Stock may convert its shares of Preferred Stock to Common Stock during
such period at any time prior to the payment date stated in such notice. If upon the occurrence of
a Liquidating Event, the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders
shall be insufficient to pay the holders of the Series C-1 Preferred Stock the full Preference
Amount to which they shall be entitled, the holders of the Series C-1 Preferred Stock shall share
ratably in any distribution of assets (so that each holder of Series C-1 Preferred Stock reccives
the same percentage of the applicable Preference Amount per share). After payment has been
made to the holders of the Series C-1 Preferred Stock of the full Preference Amount to which
they shall be entitled as aforesaid, holders of the Series C Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
receive the Preference Amount on such shares of Series C Preferred Stock. If the assets of the
Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders shall be insufficient to pay the holders
of the Series C Preferred Stock the full Preference Amount to which they shall be entitled, the
holders of the Series C Preferred Stock shall share ratably in any distribution of assets (so that
each holder of Series C Preferred Stock receives the same percentage of the applicable
Preference Amount per share). After payment has been made to the holders of the Series C
Preferred Stock and Series C-1 Preferred Stock of the full Preference Amount to which they shall
be entitled as aforesaid, holders of the Junior Preferred shall be entitled to receive the Preference
Amount on such shares of Junior Preferred. If upon the occurrence of a Liquidating Event, the
assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders shall be insufficient to pay

HLG: 209729 5
the holders of the Junior Preferred the full Preference Amount to which they shall be entitled, the
holders of the Junior Preferred shall share ratably in any distribution of assets (so that each
holder of Junior Preferred receives the same percentage of the applicable Preference Amount per
share). After payment has been made to the holders of the Preferred Stock of the full Preference
Amount to which they shall be entitled as aforesaid, any remaining assets shall be distributed
ratably among the holders of the Corporation's Common Stock and Preferred Stock (with each
share of Preferred Stock being deemed, for such purpose, to be equal to the number of shares of
Common Stock (including fractions of a share) into which such share of Preferred Stock is
convertible immediately prior to such Liquidating Event).

(c) A “Ligquidating Event” shall mean (i) any liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation, either voluntary or involuntary, or (ii) a sale, transfer, exclusive
license or other disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Corporation to, or a merger
or consolidation into, an entity, or sale of voting control; provided that such surviving entity,
immediately after the transaction, is not controlled, directly or indirectly, by the stockholders of
the Corporation. For purposes of this definition, “control” shall mean ownership of voting
securities that entitle the holders to elect more than 50% of the members of the Board of
Directors. Upon the written consent of both (i) Intersouth Partners VI, L.P. or its transferee and
at least two of either Harbert Venture Partners, L.L.C., or its transferee, Tullis-Dickerson Capital
Focus III, L.P., or its transferee, or CNF Investments II, LLC, or its transferee (collectively, the
‘Approval Threshold’) and (ii) the holders of a majority of the shares of Junior Preferred, in
each case given before the effective date of a merger or consolidation that would otherwise be a
Liquidating Event as defined herein, then such merger or consolidation shall not be deemed a
Liquidating Event and the provisions of Subsections 5(g) and 6(b) shall apply. Upon the
occurrence of any Liquidating Event that would involve the distribution of assets other than cash
with respect to the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, the value of such non-cash assets shall
be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. “Purchase Agreement’ shall mean that
certain Series C Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement dated on or about December 14, 2006, as
amended, made by and between the Corporation and the investors named therein.

3, Redemption

(a) The Corporation shall, at the option of the holders representing the
Approval Threshold (the “Electing Series C Holders’) at any time after December 13, 2011
exercised by written notice provided by such Electing Series C Holders to the Corporation at
least one hundred twenty (120) days prior to such requested redemption (a “Series C
Redemption Election’’) and subject to the provisions of this Section 3, redeem the outstanding
shares of Series C Preferred Stock and Series C-1 Preferred Stock by paying cash to the holders
thereof in respect to each such share the Redemption Price (defined below) applicable to the
Series C Preferred Stock and the Series C-1 Preferred Stock, in three (3) installments (each, a
“Series C Redemption Date”). The relative amounts of the three (3) installments shall be as
described in the Series C Redemption Election, provided that (1) each such installment shall
comprise at least twenty percent (20%), but no more than fifty percent (50%), of the total,
aggregate amount being paid to holders of Series C Preferred Stock and Series C-1 Preferred
Stock with respect to such redemption and (2) the agreed upon relative amounts of such
installments shall apply equally to all holders of Series C Preferred Stock and Series C-1
Preferred Stock. After the redemption rights of the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock and

HLG: 209729 6
Series C-] Preferred Stock have been satisfied in full, the holders of Junior Preferred have the
right to redeem the Junior Preferred as set forth below. The Corporation shall, at the option of
the holders of a majority of the then outstanding Junior Preferred (the “Electing Junior
Holders’’) at any time after December 13, 2012 exercised by written notice provided by such
Electing Junior Holders to the Corporation at least one hundred twenty (120) days prior to such
requested redemption (a “Junior Redemption Election”) and subject to the provisions of this
Section 3, redeem the outstanding shares of Junior Preferred by paying cash to the holders
thereof in respect to each such share the Redemption Price (defined below) applicable to the
Junior Preferred, in three (3) installments (each, a “Junior Redemption Date”). The relative
amounts of the three (3) installments shall be (i) as agreed upon by two-thirds (66-2/3%) of the
Electing Junior Holders and (ii) described in the Junior Redemption Election, provided that (1)
each such installment shall comprise at least twenty percent (20%), but no more than fifty
percent (50%), of the total, aggregate amount being paid to holders of Junior Preferred with
respect to such redemption and (2) the agreed upon relative amounts of such installments shall
apply equally to all holders of Junior Preferred. The first Series C Redemption Date or Junior
Redemption Date (generically, the “Redemption Date”) shall be within one hundred twenty
(120) days of the date of the Series C Redemption Election or the Junior Redemption Election
(generically, the “Redemption Election”), as the case may be, and the other applicable
Redemption Dates shall be on the first and second anniversary dates of the first applicable
Redemption Date. The price payable for each redeemed share of Preferred Stock (the
“Redemption Price’) shall be equal to (1) in the case of the Junior Preferred, the Original Price
plus any declared but unpaid dividends pursuant to Section B.1(c), and (2) in the case of the
Series C Preferred Stock and Series C-1 Preferred Stock, the Original Issue Price plus any
declared but unpaid dividends pursuant to Section B.1(c) and any Accrued Dividends that have
not been paid.

(b) Within ten (10) days of receipt by the Corporation of a Redemption
Election, the Corporation shall give written notice of such Redemption Election to all holders of
record of applicable Preferred Stock (the “Redemption Notice’). Each such holder shall be
considered an “Electing Holder” for purposes of this Section 3 whose shares shall be redeemed
on the same terms and at the same time as shares covered by the initial notice of Redemption
Election. At least thirty (30) days prior to the Redemption Date, written notice shall be mailed,
postage prepaid, to each Electing Holder at its post office address last shown on the records of
the Corporation, specifying the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price, the place at which
payment may be obtained and the date on which such holder’s Conversion Rights (as hereinafter
defined) as to such shares terminate and calling upon such holder to surrender to the Corporation,
in the manner and at the place designated, his certificate or certificates representing the shares to
be redeemed. On or after each Redemption Date, the Redemption Price of the shares to be
redeemed on such Redemption Date shall be payable to the order of the person whose name
appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof and each surrendered certificate
shall be cancelled. Any remaining shares held by the Electing Holders not yet required to be
redeemed pursuant to this Section 3(c) shall continue to be outstanding for all purposes. From
and after each Redemption Date, unless there shall have been a default in payment of the
Redemption Price payable on such Redemption Date, all dividends on the applicable Preferred
Stock designated in the Redemption Notice for redemption on such Redemption Date shall cease
to accrue as applicable to the shares of Series C Preferred Stock and Series C-1 Preferred Stock,
all rights of the holders of such shares as holders of the applicable Preferred Stock of the

HLG: 209729 7
Corporation (except the right to receive the Redemption Price upon surrender of their certificate
or certificates) shall cease with respect to such shares, and such shares shall not thereafter be
transferred on the books of the Corporation or be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose
whatsoever.

(c) If no funds or insufficient funds are legally available at the time of any
Redemption Date to redeem all of the shares of applicable Preferred Stock then due to be
redeemed, then the Corporation shall redeem shares of Series C Preferred Stock and Series C-1
Preferred Stock in preference to all other Junior Preferred and then the Corporation shall redeem
shares of applicable Preferred Stock from holders thereof pro rata based upon the aggregate
Redemption Price of the shares to be redeemed. Shares of applicable Preferred Stock that are
subject to redemption but that have not been redeemed and the Redemption Price paid or set
aside with respect thereto due to insufficient legally available funds shall continue to be
outstanding and entitled to the dividend, conversion and other nights, preferences, privileges and
restrictions of such applicable Preferred Stock until such shares have been redeemed and the
Redemption Price has been paid or set aside thereto. At any time thereafter when additional
funds of the Corporation are legally available for the redemption of shares of applicable
Preferred Stock, such funds will immediately be used to redeem the balance of the shares that the
Corporation has become obligated to redeem on any Redemption Date but that it has not
redeemed. In the event the Corporation has no funds or insufficient funds that are legally
available at the time of any Series C Redemption Date, which default has occurred for a period
of fifteen (15) days after written notice to the Corporation of such default by holders representing
the Approval Threshold, then the size of the Board shall be increased to seven (7) and the holders
of Series C Preferred Stock and the Series C-1 Preferred Stock shall be entitled to appoint the
two newly-created board positions such that the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock and
Series C-1 Preferred Stock, voting as a single class, shall be entitled to elect a majority of the
directors to the Board of Directors for so long as the Corporation’s default shall continue. Each
of (a) Intersouth Partners VI, L.P. and Harbert Venture Partners, L.L.C., or their affiliates, and
(b) Tullis-Dickerson Capital Focus III, L.P. and CNF Investments II, LLC or their affiliates, shall
be entitled to appoint one member to fill the newly-created board positions.

4. Voting

(a) Voting Rights. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or as
required by law, the holder of each share of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to the number of
votes equal to the number of shares of Common Stock into which such share of Preferred Stock
could then be converted and shall have voting rights and powers equal to the voting rights and
powers of the Common Stock (except as otherwise expressly provided herein or as required by
law, voting together with the Common Stock as a single class) and shall be entitled to notice of
any stockholders’ meeting in accordance with the Bylaws of the Corporation. Fractional votes
shall not, however, be permitted and any fractional voting rights resulting from the above
formula (after aggregating all shares of Common Stock into which shares of Preferred Stock held
by each holder could be converted) shall be reduced to the nearest whole number.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holders of Preferred Stock shall not vote as a single class
with the Common Stock with respect to any matters covered by Subsections 4(b) and 4(c).
Except as required by law, the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock and the Series C-1
Preferred Stock shall vote together as a single class.

HLG: 209729 8

Thirty Million Dollars ($30,000,000) of Corporation stock (before deduction for
underwriters’ commission and expenses) with a price per share in such offering
not less than five times the Series C Preferred Stock Original Price (subject to
appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split,
combination or other similar recapitalization affecting such shares) (a “Qualified
IPO’).

(c) Series C Preferred Stock and Series C-1 Preferred Stock Protective

Provisions. In addition to any other rights provided by law or as set forth in this Certificate of
Incorporation, so long as One Million (1,000,000) shares of Series C Preferred Stock and Series
C-1 Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations
and the like with regard to such shares) shall be outstanding, the Corporation shall not, without
first obtaining the affirmative vote or written consent of the holders representing the Approval
Threshold (whether by merger, reclassification or otherwise):

holder or holders of such Series C Preferred Stock or Series C-1] Preferred Stock in a manner
differently than the other holders of such Series C Preferred Stock or Series C-1 Preferred Stock,

HLG: 209729 11
such action shall require the consent of such materially and adversely impacted holder or holders
of such Series C Preferred Stock or Series C-1 Preferred Stock.

5. Conversion Rights

Except as otherwise provided pursuant to Section 3, each share of Preferred Stock shall
be convertible at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the issuance of such share,
into fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock of the Corporation. The number of
shares of Common Stock into which each share of the Preferred Stock may be converted shall be
determined by dividing the respective Original Price by the respective Conversion Price
(determined as hereinafter provided) in effect at the time of the conversion.

(a) Before any adjustment is made pursuant to Section 6, for each series of
Preferred Stock the Conversion Price shall be equal to the respective Original Price.

(b) The holder of any shares of Preferred Stock may exercise the conversion
rights as to such shares or any part thereof by delivering to the Corporation during regular
business hours, at the office of any transfer agent of the Corporation for the Preferred Stock, or at
the principal office of the Corporation or at such other place as may be designated by the
Corporation, the certificate or certificates for the shares to be converted, duly endorsed for
transfer to the Corporation or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer (if
required by it), accompanied by wnitten notice stating that the holder elects to convert all or a
number of such shares represented by the certificate or certificates. Such notice shall also state
such holder’s name or the names of the nominees in which such holder wishes the certificate or
certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued. Conversion shall be deemed to have been
effected on the date when such delivery is made, and such date is referred to herein as the
“Conversion Date.” As promptly as practicable thereafter the Corporation shall issue and
deliver to such holder, at such office or other place designated by the Corporation, a certificate or
certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled and a
check for cash with respect to any fractional interest in a share of Common Stock as provided in
Subsection 5(c). The holder shall be deemed to have become a stockholder of record on the
applicable Conversion Date. Upon conversion of only a portion of the number of shares of
Preferred Stock represented by a certificate surrendered for conversion, the Corporation shall
issue and deliver to the holder of the certificate so surrendered for conversion, at the expense of
the Corporation, a new certificate covering the number of shares of Preferred Stock representing
the unconverted portion of the certificate so surrendered.

(c) No fractional shares of Common Stock or scrip shall be issued upon
conversion of shares of Preferred Stock. If more than one share of Preferred Stock shall be
surrendered for conversion at any one time by the same holder, the number of full shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate
number of shares of Preferred Stock so surrendered. Instead of any fractional shares of Common
Stock that would otherwise be issuable upon conversion of any shares of Preferred Stock, the
Corporation shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fractional interest equal to the fair
market value of such fractional interest as determined in good faith by the Corporation’s Board
of Directors.

HLG: 209729 12
(d) The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and other taxes that may be
payable in respect of any issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock on conversion of
Preferred Stock pursuant hereto. The Corporation shall not, however, be required to pay any tax
that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of shares of
Common Stock in a name other than that in which the Preferred Stock so converted was
registered, and no such issue or delivery shall be made unless and until the person requesting
such issue has paid to the Corporation the amount of any such tax or has established, to the
satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax has been paid. Additionally, the Corporation shall
in no event be required to pay any personal income tax that may accrue to a holder of Preferred
Stock upon conversion of Preferred Stock to shares of Common Stock.

(e) The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available, out of its
authorized but unissued Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of
Preferred Stock, the full number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon the conversion of
all Preferred Stock from time to time outstanding. The Corporation shall from time to time use
its best effort to obtain necessary director and stockholder approvals, in accordance with the laws
of the State of Delaware, to increase the authorized amount of its Common Stock if at any time
the authorized amount of its Common Stock remaining unissued shall not be sufficient to permit
the conversion of all of the shares of Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, and shall take all
such actions as are necessary to increase such authorized amount of Common Stock upon
obtaining such approvals. Before taking any action that would cause an adjustment reducing the
applicable Conversion Price below the then-par value of the shares of Common Stock issuable
upon the conversion of Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take any corporate action that may,
in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Corporation may validly and legally
issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock at such applicable adjusted
Conversion Price.

(f) If the Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of Preferred Stock
shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock,
whether by capital reorganization, reclassification, or otherwise (other than a subdivision or
combination of shares or stock dividend provided for in Subsection 6(a)), then, and in each such
event, the holder of each share of Preferred Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such
share into the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property receivable
upon such reorganization, reclassification, or other change, by holders of the number of shares of
Common Stock into which such shares of Preferred Stock might have been converted
immediately prior to such reorganization, reclassification, or change.

(g) In case of any consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into
another corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation to
another corporation (other than a consolidation, merger or sale treated as a Liquidating Event
pursuant to Subsection 2(c) above), each share of Preferred Stock shall thereafter be convertible
into the kind and amount of shares of stock or other securities or property that a holder of the
number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation deliverable upon conversion of Preferred
Stock would have been entitled upon such consolidation, merger or sale; and in such case,
appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) shall be made in
the application of the provisions of Sections 5 and 6 with respect to the rights and interest
thereafter of the holders of Preferred Stock, to the end that the provisions set forth in Sections 5

HLG: 209729 13
and 6 shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any shares of
stock or other property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of Preferred Stock.

(h) If any shares of Common Stock to be reserved for the purpose of
conversion of shares of Preferred Stock require registration or listing with, or approval of, any
governmental authority, stock exchange or other regulatory body under any federal or state law
or regulation or otherwise, before such shares may be validly issued or delivered upon
conversion, the Corporation will in good faith and as expeditiously as possible endeavor to
secure such registration, listing or approval, as the case may be.

(1) All shares of Common Stock that may be issued upon conversion of the
shares of Preferred Stock will, upon issuance by the Corporation, be validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable and free from all taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issuance thereof.

(j) In case any shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted pursuant to
Sections 5 or 6 hereof, the shares so converted shall resume the status of authorized but unissued
shares of Preferred Stock.

(k) | The Corporation will not, by amendment of its Certificate of Incorporation
or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale
of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance
of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Corporation, but will at all
times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all of the provisions of Sections 5 and 6 and in the
taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the conversion
rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock against impairment, provided that the Corporation
may amend its Certificate of Incorporation or enter into any reorganization, transfer of assets,
consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securitics or any other voluntary action upon
approval as required by Sections 4(b) and 4(c), if reasonable provisions have been made with
respect to the rights of the Preferred Stock.

6. Adjustment of Conversion Price

The Conversion Price from time to time in effect shall be subject to adjustment from time
to time as follows.

(a) Stock Splits, Dividends and Combinations. In case the Corporation shall
at any time subdivide the outstanding shares of Common Stock or shall issue a dividend in
Common Stock on its outstanding Common Stock, in each case without a corresponding
adjustment to any series of Preferred Stock, the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred
Stock in effect immediately prior to such subdivision or the issuance of such dividend shall be
proportionately decreased, and in case the Corporation shall at any time combine the outstanding
shares of Common Stock into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, without a
corresponding adjustment to any series of Preferred Stock, the Conversion Price for such series
of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such combination shall be proportionately
increased, concurrently with the effectiveness of such subdivision, dividend or combination, as
the case may be.

HLG: 209729 14
(b) Notice of Noncash Dividends, Stock Purchase Rights, Capital
Reorganizations and Dissolutions. In case:

(a) the Corporation shall take a record of the holders of its Common
Stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend or any other distribution,
payable otherwise than in cash; or

(b) the Corporation shall take a record of the holders of its Common
Stock for the purpose of entitling them to subscribe for or purchase any shares of stock of
any class or to receive any other rights; or

(c) of any capital reorganization of the Corporation, reclassification of
the capital stock of the Corporation (other than a subdivision or combination of its
outstanding shares of Common Stock), consolidation or merger of the Corporation with
or into another Corporation that is not a Liquidating Event or conveyance of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Corporation to another Corporation that is not a
Liquidating Event;

then, and in any such case, the Corporation shall cause to be mailed to the transfer agent for the
Preferred Stock and to the holders of record of the outstanding Preferred Stock, at least 20 days
prior to the date hereinafter specified, a notice stating the date on which (i) a record is to be taken
for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or mghts or (ii) such reclassification,
reorganization, consolidation, merger, conveyance, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is to
take place and the date, if any is to be fixed, as of which holders of Common Stock of record
shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock for securities or other property
deliverable upon such reclassification, reorganization, consolidation, merger, conveyance,
dissolution, liquidation or winding up.

(c) Issuances at Less Than the Conversion Price. Upon the issuance or sale
by the Corporation of:

(a) Common Stock for a consideration per share less than the
respective Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the time of such issue or sale;
or

(b) any Stock Purchase Rights where the consideration per share for
which shares of Common Stock may at any time thereafter be issuable upon exercise
thereof (or, in the case of Stock Purchase Rights exercisable for the purchase of
Convertible Securities, upon the subsequent conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities) shall be less than the respective Conversion Price in effect immediately prior
to the time of the issue or sale of such Stock Purchase Rights; or

(c) any Convertible Securities where the consideration per share for
which shares of Common Stock may at any time thereafter be issuable pursuant to the
terms of such Convertible Securities shall be less than the respective Conversion Price in
effect immediately prior to the time of the issue or sale of such Convertible Secunities;

HLG: 209729 15
other than an issuance of Common Stock, Stock Purchase Rights or Convertible Securities
pursuant to Subsections 6(a) or 6(d)(6) hereof (any such issuance shall be referred to hereinafter
as a ‘“Dilutive Issuance’’), then forthwith upon such issue or sale, the Conversion Price for such
series of Preferred Stock shall be reduced to a price (calculated to the nearest cent) determined
by the following formula:

N+C
N+AS

cp! =cp *

where:
CP' = the Conversion Price as so adjusted;
CP = the former Conversion Price;

N = the number of shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock (on an as-
converted basis) outstanding immediately prior to such issuance;

C = the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration
received or deemed to be received by the Corporation for the total number
of additional securities so issued or deemed to be issued would purchase if
the purchase price per share were equal to the then-existing Conversion
Price;

AS = the number of shares of Common Stock so issued or deemed to be issued.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Conversion Price shall not be reduced at such time if such
reduction would be an amount less than $.01, but any such amount shall be carried forward and
deduction with respect thereto made at the time of and together with any subsequent reduction
that, together with such amount and any other amount or amounts so carried forward, shall
aggregate $.01 or more.

In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, any adjustments to the conversion price of the Junior
Preferred that is caused by the issuance of the Series C Preferred Stock and Series C-1 Preferred
Stock shall be calculated only on the basis of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock and Series
C-1 Preferred Stock actually issued by the Corporation in accordance with the Purchase
Agreement.

(d) For purposes of this Section 6, the following provisions will be applicable:

(1) “Convertible Securities” shall mean evidences of indebtedness,
shares of stock (including, without limitation, the Preferred Stock) or other securities that
are convertible into or exchangeable for, with or without payment of additional
consideration, shares of Common Stock.

(2) “Stock Purchase Rights” shall mean any warrants, options or other

rights to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of Common Stock or
any Convertible Securities.

HLG: 209729 16
(3) Convertible Securities and Stock Purchase Rights shall be deemed
outstanding and issued or sold at the time of such issue or sale.

(4) Determination of Consideration. The “consideration actually
received” by the Corporation for the issuance, sale, grant or assumption of shares of
Common Stock, Stock Purchase Rights or Convertible Securities, irrespective of the
accounting treatment of such consideration, shall be valued as follows:

1) Cash Payment. In the case of cash, the net amount received
by the Corporation after deduction of any accrued interest or dividends and before
deducting any expenses paid or incurred and any underwriting commissions or
concessions paid or allowed by the Corporation in connection with such issue or
sale;

il) Noncash Payment. In the case of consideration other than
cash, the value of such consideration, including the value of any loan made in
connection with the issuance of Stock Purchase Rights or Convertible Securities,
which shall not include the value of any Convertible Securities of the Corporation
being converted or exchanged, as determined by the Board of Directors in good
faith, after deducting any accrued interest or dividends; and

iii) Stock Purchase Rights and Convertible Securities. The

total consideration, if any, received by the Corporation as consideration for the
issuance of the Stock Purchase Rights or the Convertible Securities, as the case
may be, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any,
payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such Stock Purchase Rights or
upon the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, as the case may
be, in each case after deducting any accrued interest or dividends. Where as part
of the same transaction or series of related transactions occurring within a sixty
(60) day period more than one type of Convertible Securities and/or Stock
Purchase Rights or both Convertible Securities and Stock Purchase Rights are
issued, the determination as to whether a Dilutive Issuance has occurred shall be
made on an aggregate basis, taking into account all Convertible Securities and all
Stock Purchase Rights whose conversion or exercise are conditioned on the
conversion or exercise of the other Convertible Securities and Stock Purchase
Rights.

(5) Readjustment of Conversion Price. In the event of any change in
(i) the consideration, if any, payable upon exercise of any Stock Purchase Rights or upon
the conversion or exchange of any Convertible Securities (including additional
consideration paid to extend the term or to change another provision of the Stock
Purchase Rights or Convertible Securities or required as a condition of exercise or
conversion) or (ii) the rate at which any Convertible Securities are convertible into or
exchangeable for shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price as computed upon the
original issue thereof shall forthwith be readjusted to the Conversion Price that would
have been in effect at such time had such Stock Purchase Rights or Convertible Securities
provided for such changed purchase price, consideration or conversion rate, as the case

HLG: 209729 17
may be, at the time initially granted, issued or sold. On the expiration of any Stock
Purchase Rights not exercised or of any right to convert or exchange under any
Convertible Securities not exercised, the Conversion Price then in effect shall forthwith
be increased to the Conversion Price that would have been in effect at the time of such
expiration had such Stock Purchase Rights or Convertible Securities never been issued.
No readjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Subsection 6(d)(5) shall (i)
increase the applicable Conversion Price by an amount in excess of the adjustment
originally made to the Conversion Price in respect of the issue, sale or grant of the
applicable Stock Purchase Rights or Convertible Securities or (ii) require any adjustment
to the amount paid or number of shares of Common Stock received by any holder of
Preferred Stock upon any conversion of any share of Preferred Stock prior to the date
upon which such readjustment to the Conversion Price shall occur.

(6) Exclusions. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the
Corporation shall not be required to make any adjustment of the Conversion Price in the
case of (i) the issuance or sale of Common Stock or of options, or the shares of stock
issuable upon exercise of such options, to purchase up to Three Million Five Hundred
One Thousand Eight Hundred Sixty-Nine ( 3,501,869) shares of Common Stock granted
after the date hereof (together with the exercise of up to 2,447,131 shares of Common
Stock issuable for options granted prior to the date hereof), subject to adjustment for
stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations and the like, to directors, officers,
employees or consultants of the Corporation pursuant to stock options or stock purchase
plans or agreements, whether “qualified” for tax purposes or not, pursuant to plans or
arrangements approved by the Board of Directors, (ii) the issuance or sale of any other
shares of Common Stock, Convertible Securities or Stock Purchase Rights as to which
the holders of two-thirds (66-2/3%) of the outstanding shares of Junior Preferred and the
Approval Threshold of the outstanding shares of Scries C Preferred Stock and Series C-1
Preferred Stock have expressly waived such adjustment to the Conversion Price pursuant
to this Section 6, (iii) the issuance of Common Stock upon conversion of the Preferred
Stock, (iv) any dividends or distributions on Preferred Stock, (v) the issuance of warrants
to purchase shares of Common Stock to banks or equipment lessors, as approved by the
Board of Directors, such issuances not to exceed in the aggregate one percent (1%) of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Corporation on a fully-diluted, as-converted
into Common Stock basis, (vi) the issuance of shares of Common Stock, Convertible
Securities, or Stock Purchase Rights in connection with business combinations or
corporate partnering agreements, as approved by the Board of Directors, such issuances
not to exceed in the aggregate five percent (5%) of the outstanding shares of Common
Stock of the Corporation on a fully-diluted, as-converted into Common Stock basis, (vil)
the sale of shares of Common Stock in connection with a Qualified IPO, or (viii) solely
with respect to the Junior Preferred, any issuance or deemed issuance of Common Stock,
Convertible Securities or Stock Purchase Rights other than shares of Series C Preferred
or Series C-1 Preferred Stock issued in accordance with the terms of the Purchase
Agreement. The issuances or sales described in the preceding clauses (1), (ii), (iii), (iv),
(v), (vi), (vii) and (viii) (solely with respect to the Junior Preferred) shall be ignored for
purposes of calculating any adjustment to any Conversion Price.

HLG: 209729 18
(7) Notice of Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment
or readjustment of the applicable Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 6, the
Corporation at its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in
accordance with the terms thereof, and prepare and furnish to each holder of Preferred
Stock affected thereby a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and
showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The
Corporation shall, upon the written notice at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock
furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such
adjustment or readjustment, (ii) the applicable Conversion Price at the time in effect and
(iit) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property that
at the time would be received upon the conversion of such holder’s shares.

(e) Adjustment_in the Absence of a Qualified IPO. In the event that a
Qualified IPO does not occur prior to September 30, 2008, then if the Company completes a
Qualified Financing (as defined below) after September 30, 2008 and such transaction
constitutes a Dilutive Issuance with respect to the then existing Conversion Price for the Series
C-1 Preferred Stock, then upon the consummation of such Qualified Financing the Conversion
Price for the Series C-1 Preferred Stock then in effect shall be decreased to the greater of (i) the
consideration per share received by the Company in the Qualified Financing (as determined in
accordance with this Section 6) and (ii) the then-applicable Conversion Price of the Series C
Preferred Stock. Except as set forth above, the Conversion Price for the Series C-1 Preferred
Stock shall otherwise be adjusted in accordance with the other provisions of this Section 6. A
“Qualified Financing” shall mean the first to occur of (x) a financing or series of related
financings in which the Company issues shares of its Preferred Stock for aggregate proceeds to
the Company of at least $5,000,000 or (y) a financing transaction in which the Company sells
Preferred Stock where the proceeds to the Company, when combined with all other financings
completed by the Company since September 30, 2008, are at least $5,000,000 (provided that, in
the case of (y) above, the average consideration per share for all shares sold in such financing
and in the other financings completed by the Company since September 30, 2008 shall be used
for the purpose of this Section 6(e) and for determining whether such a financing is a Dilutive
Issuance).

7. Mandatory Conversion

Each share of each applicable series of Preferred Stock shall automatically be
converted into shares of Common Stock at the then-applicable conversion rate upon the
occurrence of (1) a Qualified IPO, (2) for the conversion of Junior Preferred, the affirmative vote
of the holders of at least two-thirds (66-2/3%) the then-outstanding shares of Junior Preferred,
voting together as a single class, or (3) for the conversion of Series C Preferred Stock and the
Series C-1 Preferred Stock, the affirmative vote of the Approval Threshold (the “Conversion
Event’). Immediately upon the occurrence of a Conversion Event, the Preferred Stock shall
cease to have any rights of Preferred Stock and shall instead have the rights attributable to the
shares of Common Stock into which the Preferred Stock is automatically converted, whether or
not Preferred Stock certificates have been exchanged for Common Stock certificates. All holders
of record of shares of Preferred Stock will be given at least ten (10) days prior written notice of
the estimated earliest date upon which mandatory conversion of the Preferred Stock could occur
and the event constituting the Conversion Event. Such notice shall be sent by first class mail,

HLG: 209729 19
postage prepaid, to each holder of record of Preferred Stock at such holder’s address as shown in
the records of the Corporation. Each holder of shares of the Preferred Stock shall surrender the
certificate or certificates for all such shares to the Corporation at the place designated in such
notice and shall thereafter receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to
which such holder is entitled. The mechanics for conversion and other provisions relating to
conversion of Preferred Stock into Common Stock set forth elsewhere in this Certificate of
Incorporation shall apply to the mandatory conversion of the Preferred Stock.

8. Special Mandatory Conversion

(a) In the event that the conditions for the Series C-1 Closing (as set forth in
Section 5.2 of the Purchase Agreement) have been satisfied and any holder of shares of Series C
Preferred Stock (or an affiliate of such holder) does not purchase pursuant to Section 2.4 of the
Purchase Agreement at such Series C-1 Closing shares of Series C-1 Preferred Stock in an
amount equal to or greater than its allotted amount as shown under the heading “Shares
Purchased at Series C-1 Closing” on Exhibit A to the Purchase Agreement (a “Purchase
Default’), then effective upon, subject to, and concurrently with, the consummation of the Series
C-1 Closing all shares of Series C Preferred Stock held by such holder shall automatically and
without any further action on the part of such holder, be converted into shares of Common Stock
in accordance with this Section 8. Upon such Purchase Default, any shares of Series C Preferred
Stock so converted shall be cancelled and not subject to reissuance.

(b) Upon a Purchase Default, each holder of shares of Series C Preferred
Stock converted pursuant to Section 8(a) shall surrender his, her or its certificate or certificates
for all such shares to the Corporation at the place designated in the notice of conversion
delivered by the Corporation, and shall thereafter receive certificates for one-tenth (1/10) of the
number of shares of Common Stock determined by dividing the Original Price for the Series C
Preferred Stock by the Conversion Price for the Series C Preferred Stock. All rights with respect
to the Series C Preferred Stock converted pursuant to Section 8(a), including the rights, if any, to
receive notices and vote, will terminate, except only the nghts of the holders thereof, upon
surrender of their certificate or certificates therefore, to receive certificates for the number of
shares of Common Stock into which such Series C Preferred Stock has been converted. If so
required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or
accompanied by written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the
Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or by his, her or its attorney duly authorized
in writing. As soon as practicable after the Purchase Default and the surrender of the certificate
or certificates for Series C Preferred Stock so converted, the Corporation shall cause to be issued
and delivered to such holder, or on his, her or its written order, a certificate or certificates for the
number of shares of Common Stock issuable on such conversion in accordance with the
provisions hereof.

(c) All certificates evidencing shares of Series C Preferred Stock which are
required to be surrendered for conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof shall, from
and after the time of the Purchase Default, be deemed to have been retired and cancelled, and the
shares of Series C Preferred Stock converted pursuant to Section 8(a) represented thereby shall,
from and after the time of the Purchase Default, be deemed to have been converted into Common
Stock for all purposes, notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender

HLG: 209729 20
such certificates on or prior to such date. The Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate
action (without the need for stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized
number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock accordingly.

stockholders, (b) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct
or a knowing violation of law, (c) under Section 174 of the General Corporation Law of
Delaware or any successor provision, (d) for any transaction from which such director derived an
improper personal benefit, or (e) acts or omissions occurring prior to the date of the effectiveness
of this provision.

Furthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing provision, in the event that the General
Corporation Law of Delaware is amended or enacted to permit further limitation or elimination
of the personal liability of the director, the personal liability of the corporation’s directors shall
be limited or eliminated to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable law.

In the event that a director of the Corporation who is also a partner or employee of an
entity that is a holder of Preferred Stock and that is in the business of investing and reinvesting in
other entities, or an employee of an entity that manages such an entity (each, a Fund”), acquires
knowledge of a potential transaction or matter in such person’s capacity as a partner or employee
of the Fund or the manager or general partner of the Fund and that may be a corporate
opportunity for both the Corporation and such Fund (a “Corporate Opportunity”), then (i) such
Corporate Opportunity shall belong to such Fund, (ii) such director shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, have fully satisfied and fulfilled his fiduciary duty to the Corporation and its
stockholders with respect to such Corporate Opportunity, and (ii) the Corporation, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, waives any claim that such Corporate Opportunity constituted a
corporate opportunity that should have been presented to the Corporation or any of its affiliates
provided, however, that such director acts in good faith and such opportunity was not offered to
such person in his or her capacity as a director of the Corporation and provided, further, that
nothing herein or otherwise shall limit the Corporation’s right to pursue or consummate any
transaction related to any Corporate Opportunity even if originated by any director or any Fund.

The above provisions shall not affect any provision permitted under the General
Corporation Law of Delaware in this Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws or contract or
resolution of the corporation indemnifying or agreeing to indemnify a director against personal
liability. Any repeal or modification of this provision shall not adversely affect any limitation
hereunder on the personal liability of the director with respect to acts or omissions occurring

any law, bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders, or otherwise. Any repeal or modification of
this Article LX shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director or former director
existing under this Article LX with respect to any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal
or modification.
