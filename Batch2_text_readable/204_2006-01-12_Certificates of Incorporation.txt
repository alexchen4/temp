the date of issuance of such share of Series A Preferred Stock to and including the earlier of the

Such dividends shall be cumulative and accrue whether or not they have been declared and
whether or not there are profits, surplus or other funds of the Corporation legally available for
the payment of dividends. Any accrued but unpaid dividends shall be paid when, as and if,
declared by the Board or as otherwise set forth in this Certificate of Incorporation. All accrued
and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock shall be fully paid or declared with funds
irrevocably set apart for payment before any dividend, distribution or payment may be made
with respect to any Preferred Shares (other than the Series A Preferred Shares) or Junior

Section 3. Voting Rights. The Series A Preferred Stock shall have those voting
rights set forth for the Series A Preferred Shares in Part C below.

Section 4. Conversion.
4.1 Conversion Procedure.

(a) At any time and from time to time, any holder of Series A
Preferred Shares may convert all or any portion of the Series A Preferred Shares (including any
fraction of a share) held by such holder into the number of shares of Common Stock obtained by
adding (i) the number of shares determined by (A) multiplying the number of Series A Preferred
Shares to be converted by the Series A Liquidation Value, and (B) dividing the resulting product
by the Scrics A Conversion Price (as provided in Section 4.2(a) below) then in effect, plus (ii)
the numbcr of shares determined by dividing the total amount of any accrued and unpaid
dividends with respect to such Series A Prefezred Shares to be converted by the Series A
Conversion Price then in effect.

(b) Each conversion of Preferred Shares will be deemed to have been
effected as of the close of business on the date on which the stockholder delivers written notice
to the Corporation at its principal office of its desire to convert shares of Preferred Stock and
surrenders the certificate or certificates representing the Preferred Shares to be converted. At
such time as such conversion has been effected, the rights of the holder of such Preferred Shares
as such holder will cease and the Person or Persons in whose name or names any certificate or
certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued upon such conversion will be deemed to
have become the holder or holders of record of the shares of Common Stock represented thereby,
All shares of Series A Preferred Stock tendered for conversion shall, from and after the date of
conversion, be deemed to have been retired and cancelled and shal] not be reissued as Series A
Preferred Stock and the Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate action as may be
necessary to reduce accordingly the authorized number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock.

(c) As soon as possible after a conversion has been effected (but in
any event within five (5) business days in the case of Sections 4.1(c)(i) and 4.1(c)(iii) below), the
Corporation will deliver to the converting holder:

(i) a certificate or certificates representing the number of shares of Common
Stock issuable by reason of such conversion in such name or names and such
denomination or denominations as the converting holder has specified;

(ii) payment of the amount payable under Section 4.1(f) below with respect to
such conversion; end

(iii) a certificate representing any Series A Preferred Shares that were
represented by the certificate or certificates delivered to the Corporation in connection
with such conversion but which were not converted.

(d) The issuance of certificates for shares of Common Stock upon
conversion of Series A Preferred Stock will be made without charge to the holders of such Series
A Preferred Stock for any issuance tax in respect thereof or other cost incurred by the
Corporation in connection with such conversion and the related issuance cf shares of Common
Stock. Upon conversion of each Series A Preferred Share, the Corporation will take all such
actions as are necessary in order to insure that the Common Stock issuable with respect to such
conversion will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

(e) The Corporation will not close its books against the transfer of
shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Common Stock issued or issuable upon conversion of
shares of Series A Preferred Stock in any manner that interferes with the timely conversion of
Series A Preferred Stock.

$9) If eny fractional interest in a share of Common Stock would,
except for the provisions of this Section 4.1(f), be deliverable upon any conversion of the Series
A Preferred Stock, the Corporation, in lieu of delivering the fractional share therefor, may pay an
amount to the holder thereof equal to the fair market value (as reasonably determined in good
faith by the Board) of such fractional interest as of the date of conversion.

(gz) | The Corporation shall at al] times reserve and keep available, out
of its authorized but unissued Common Stock, such number of Common Shares as would be
issuable upon the conversion of all Series A Preferred Shares then outstanding.

4.2 Conversion Prices.

(a) Initial Series A Conversion Price. The initial “Series A
Conversion Price” will be $0.6925. In order to prevent dilution of the conversion rights granted
to holders of Series A Preferred Shares hereunder, the Series A Conversion Price will be subject

A. For purposes of this Section 4.2, the Corporation shall be deemed to have issued or sold
Common Stock under the circumstances as set forth in Section 4.3 below.

(b) Adjustment for Dilutive Events. If and whenever on or after the
original date of issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Corporation issues or sells, or in
accordance with Section 4.3 below is deemed to have issued or sold, any shares of Common
Stock (or any Options or Convertible Securities, in each case, as defined below) for
consideration per share less than the applicable Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately

(a) Issuance _of Rights or Options. If (i) the Corporation in any

manner grants any rights or options to subscribe for or to purchase shares of Common Stock or
any securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock (such rights or
options referred to herein as “Options” and such convertible or exchangeable stock or securities
teferred to herein as “Convertible Securities”) whether or not such Options or the right to convert
or exchange any such Convertible Securitics are immediately exercisable and (ii) the Price Per
Share of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Options or upon conversion
or exchange of such Convertible Securities is less than the Series A Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to the time of the granting of such Options, then (x) the total maximum
number of shares of such Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Options or upon
conversion or exchange of the total maximum number of Convertible Securities issuable upon
the exercise of such Options will be deemed to be Common Stock issued and sold by the
Corporation, (y) the consideration received pursuant to the Dilutive Event will equal the Price
Per Share times the number of shares of Common Stock so deemed issued and sold by the
Corporation and (z) the number of shares of Common Stock so deemed issued and sold by the
Corporation shall be included in the Common Stock Deemed Outstanding immediately after such
Dilutive Event. For purposes of this Section 4.3(a), the “Price Per Share” will be determined by

upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities;
provided, that, if such Options expire or lapse without being exercised and/or converted into
Common Stock, then the Series A Conversion Price will be readjusted to the Series A

mamner issues or sells any Convertible Securities whether or not the right to convert or exchange
any such Convertible Securities are immediately exercisable and (ii) the Price Per Share of
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion or exchange is less than the Series A
Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the time of such issue or sale, then (x) the
maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities will be deemed to be Common Stock issued and sold by the Corporation,
(y) the consideration received pursuant to the Dilutive Event will equal the Price Per Share times

Mt of shares of Common Stock so deemed issued and sold by the Corporation shail be

included in the Common Stock Deemed Outstanding immediately after such Dilutive Event. For
the purposes of this Section 4.3(b), the “Price Per Share” will be determined by dividing (i) the
total amount received or receivable by the Corporation as consideration for the issue or salc of
such Convertible Securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if
any, payable to the Corporation upon the conversion or exchange thereof, by (ii) the total
maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion or exchange of all
such Convertible Securities. No further adjustment of the Series A Conversion Price will be
made when Common Stock is actually issued upon the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities, and if any such issue or sale of such Convertible Securities is made upon
exercise of any Options for which adjustments to the Series A Conversion Price had been or are
to be made pursuant to Section 4.3(a) above, no further adjustment of the Series A Conversion
Price will be made by reason of such issue or sale; provided, that, if such Convertible Securities
expire or lapse without being exercised and/or converted into Common Stock, then the Series A
Conversion Price will be readjusted to the Series A Conversion Price which would have been in
effect had such expired or lapsed Convertible Securities not been issued.

(c) Change in Option Pnce or Conversion Rate. If at any time there is
a change in (i) the purchase price provided for in any Options, (ii) the additional consideration, if
any, payable upon the conversion or exchange of any Convertible Securities, or (iii) the rate at
which any Convertible Securities are convertible or exchangeable for Common Stock, then the
Series A Conversion Price in effect at the time of such change will be readjusted to the Series A
Conversion Price which would have been in effect had those Options or Convertible Securities
still outstanding at the time of such change provided for such changed purchase price, additional
consideration or changed conversion rate, as the case may be, at the time such Options or
Convertible Securities were initially granted, issued or sold but only if as a result of such
adjustment the Series A Conversion Price then in effect hereunder would have been reduced; and
on the termination of amy such Option or any right to convert or exchange such Convertible
Securities, the Series A Conversion Price then in effect hereunder shall forthwith be increased to
the Series A Conversion Price which would have been in effect at the time of such termination
had such Option or Convertible Securities, to the extent outstanding immediately prior to such
termination, never been issued.

(d) Calculation of Consideration Received. If any shares of Common
Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are issued or so]d or deemed to have been issued or sold
for cash, the consideration received therefor or the Price Per Share, as the case may be, will be
deemed to be the net amount received or to be received by the Corporation therefor. In case any
shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are issued or sold for a consideration
other than cash, the amount of the consideration other than cash received by the Corporation or
the non-cash portion of the Price Per Share, as the case may be, will be the Fair Market Value of
such consideration received or to be received, respectively, by the Corporation; except where
such consideration consists of securities, in which case the amount of consideration received or

to be received, respectively, by the Corporation will be the Market Price thereof as of the date of
receipt. If any shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are issued in
connection with any merger in which the Corporation is the surviving corporation, the amount of
consideration therefor will be deemed to be the Fair Market Value of such portion of the net
assets and business of the non-surviving corporation as is attributable to such shares of Common
Stock, Options or Convertible Securities, as the case may be.

(e) Integrated Transactions In case any Option is issued in
connection with the issuance or sale of other securities of the Corporation, together comprising
one integrated transaction in which no specific consideration is allocated to such Option by the
patties thereto, the Option will be deemed to have been issued for a consideration of $0.01.

(f) Treasury Shares. The number of shares of Common Stock
Deemed Outstanding at any given time shall not include shares owned or held by or for the
account of the Corporation, and the disposition of any shares so owned or held shall be
considered an issuance or sale of Common Stock by the Corporation.

(g) Record Date. If the Corporation takes a record of the holders of
Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them (i) to receive a dividend or other distribution
payable in shares of Common Stock, Options or in Convertible Securities or (ii) to subscribe for
or purchase shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities, then such record date
will be deemed to be the date of the issuance or sale of the shares of Common Stock deemed to
have been issued or sold upon the declaration of such dividend or upon the making of such other
distribution or the date of the granting of such right of subscription or purchase, as the case may
be. :

4.4 Subdivision or Combination of Common Stock. If the Corporation at any
time subdivides (by any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or otherwise) its outstanding
shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, the Series A Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such subdivision will be proportionately reduced so that the number of
shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of each share of Series A Preferred Stock
shall be increased in proportion to such increase of the aggregate number of shares of
outstanding Common Stock. If the Corporation at any time combines (by reverse stock split or
otherwise) its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, the Series A
Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such combination will be proportionately
increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of each share
of Series A Preferred Stcck shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease of the aggregate
number of shares of outstanding Common Stock.

4.5 Organic Change. Upon the consummation of an Organic Change, the
terms of the Preferred Stock shall be deemed modified, without payment of any additional
consideration therefor, so as to provide that upon the conversion of the Preferred Shares
following the consummation of such Organic Change, the holder of such Preferred Shares shall

have the right to acquire and receive (in lieu of or in addition to the shares of Common Stock
acquirable and receivable prior to the Organic Change) such shares of stock, securities or assets
as such holder would have received if such holder had converted its Preferred Shares into
Common Stock immediately prior to such Organic Change, in each case giving effect to any
adjustment of the Series A Conversion Price made after the date of consummation of the Organic
Change. All other terms of the Preferred Stock shall remain in full force and effect following
such an Organic Change. The provisions of this Section 4.5 shall similarly apply to successive
Organic Changes.

4.6 Notices.

(a) Immediately upon any adjustment of the Series A Conversion
Price, the Corporation shall give written notice thereof to all holders of Series A Prefcrred Stock
specifying the Series A Conversion Price in effect thereafter.

(b) The Corporation shall give written notice to all holders of
Preferred Stock at least twenty (20) days prior to the date on which the Corporation closes its
books or takes a record for determining rights to vote with respect to any Organic Change,

4.7 Mandatory Conversion. If the holder or holders of not less than two-thirds
of the Series A Preferred Shares then outstanding shall so elect, by vote or written consent, all of
the outstanding Series A Preferred Shares (and any accrued but unpaid dividends thereon) shall
automatically convert into shares of Common Steck upon such election, vote or consent and
without any further action by the holders of such Series A Preferred Shares and whether or not
the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent.

4.8 Conversion _U; ualified Public Offering. If a firm
conunitment underwritten Public Offering of shares of Common Stock (a “Qualified Public
Offering”) is effected in which (a) the aggregate price paid by the public for the shares is at least
$30,000,000 and (b) the price per share paid by the public for such shares is at least five hundred
percent (500%) of the Series A Liquidation Value, then all of the outstanding shares of Preferred
Stock (and any accrued but unpaid dividends thereon except as provided in Section 2(d)) shall be
automatically converted into shares of Common Stock immediately prior to and conditioned
upon the closing of the sale of shares pursuant to such Qualified Public Offering, all without any
further action by the holders of such Preferred Shares and whether or not the certificates
representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent.

4.9 Certain Events. If eny event similar to or of the type contemplated by the
provisions of this Section 4, but not expressly provided for by such provisions, occurs, then the
Board will make an appropriate and equitable adjustment in the Series A Conversion Price so as
to protect the rights of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock; provided, that no such adjustment
