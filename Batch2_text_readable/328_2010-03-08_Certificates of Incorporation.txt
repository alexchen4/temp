(c) Mechanics of Conversion.

(i) Notice of Conversion. In order for a holder of Series B Preferred
Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock or Series E Preferred Stock to
voluntarily convert shares of Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D
Preferred Stock or Series E Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall
surrender the certificate or certificates for such shares of Series B Preferred Stock, Series C
Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock or Series E Preferred Stock (or, if such registered
holder alleges that such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit
and agreement reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against
any claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or
destruction of such certificate), at the office of the transfer agent for the Series B Preferred Stock,
Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock or Series E Preferred Stock (or at the
principal office of the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent), together
with written notice that such holder elects to convert all or any number of the shares of the Series
B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock. Series D Preferred Stock or Series E Preferred
Stock represented by such certificate or certificates and, if applicable, any event on which such
conversion is contingent. Such notice shall state such holder’s name or the names of the
nominees in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock
to be issued. If required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be
endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory
to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or his, her or its attorney duly

Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent) of such certificates (or lost

-I1-

USIDOCS 744$555v6
certificate affidavit and agreement) and notice shall be the time of conversion (the “Conversion
Time”), and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the shares represented by
such certificate shall be deemed to be outstanding of record as of such date. The Corporation
shall, as soon as practicable after the Conversion Time, issue and deliver to such holder of Series
B Preferred, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock or Series E Preferred Stock. or to
his, her or its nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common
Stock issuable upon such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof, a certificate for
the number (if any) of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D
Preferred Stock or Series E Preferred Stock represented by the surrendered certificate that were
not converted into Common Stock, and cash as provided in Subsection 4(b) in lieu of any
fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion and payment of
any declared but unpaid dividends on the shares of Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred
Stock, Serics D Preferred Stock or Series E Preferred Stock so converted.

(ii) | Reservation of Shares. The Corporation shall at al! times when the
Series B Preferred Stock, the Series C Preferred Stock, the Series D Preferred Stock or the Series
E Preferred Stock shall be outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but
unissued capital stock, for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Series B Preferred
Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock or Series E Preferred Stock, such
number of its duly authorized shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to
effect the conversion of all outstanding Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock.
Series D Preferred Stock and Series E Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all then outstanding shares of the Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D
Preferred Stock and Series E Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall take such corporate action as
may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such
number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging
in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to the
Certificate of Incorporation. Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment
reducing the Series B Conversion Price, the Series C Conversion Price, the Series D Conversion
Price or the Series E Conversion Price below the then par value of the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock, the Series C Preferred Stock, the
Series D Preferred Stock or the Series E Preferred Stock, as the case may be, the Corporation
will take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that
the Corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common
Stock at such adjusted Series B Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price, Series D
Conversion Price or Series E Conversion Price, as the case may be.

(iii)E _ffect of Conversion. All shares of Series B Preferred Stock,
Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock and Series E Preferred Stock, which shall
have been surrendered for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be
outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares shall immediately cease and terminate at
the Conversion Time, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive shares of Common
Stock in exchange therefor and to receive payment of any dividends declared but unpaid thereon.
Any shares of Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock and
Series E Preferred Stock so converted shall be retired and cancelled and may not be reissued as
shares of such series, and the Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate action (without

-12-

USIDOCS 7445555v6
the need for stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares
of Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock or Series E
Preferred Stock, as the case may be, accordingly.

(iv) No Further Adjustment. Upon any such conversion, no adjustment
to the Series B Conversion Price, the Series C Conversion Price, the Series D Conversion Price
or the Series E Conversion Price, as the case may be, shall be made for any declared but unpaid
dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock or
Series E Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion or on the Common Stock delivered upon
conversion.

(v) | Taxes. The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and other
similar taxes that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of Common
Stock upon conversion of shares of Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D
Preferred Stock or Series E Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4. The Corporation shall
not, however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer
involved in the issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in
which the shares of Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock
or Series E Preferred Stock so converted were registered, and no such issuance or delivery shall
be made unless and until the person or entity requesting such issuance has paid to the
Corporation the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Corporation,
that such tax has been paid.

insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
aggregate amount of cash reccived by the
Corporation, excluding amounts paid or payable for
accrued interest;

Stock’’) who holds more than 250,000 shares of Convertible Stock does not participate in a
Qualified Financing (as defined below) by purchasing in the aggregate, in such Qualified
Financing and within the time period specified by the Corporation (provided that the Corporation
has cither complied with the requirements of Section 3 of the Fourth Amended and Restated
Investor Rights Agreement dated on or about the date of the filing of this Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, as amended from time to time, or the requirements of such Section 3 have been

-24-

USIDOCS 7445555v6

for determining the number of Offered Securities (as defined below) a holder of Convertible
Stock has purchased in a Qualified Financing, all shares of Convertible Stock held by Affiliates
(as defined below) of such holder shall be aggregated with such holder’s shares and all Offered
Securities purchased by Affiliates of such holder shall be aggregated with the Offered Securities
purchased by such holder (provided that no shares or securities shall be attributed to more than
one entity or person within any such group of affiliated entities or persons). Such conversion is
referred to as a “Special Mandatory Conversion.”

(b) Procedural Requirements. Upon a Special Mandatory Conversion, each
holder of shares of Convertible Stock converted pursuant to Subsection 5A(a) shall be sent
written notice of such Special Mandatory Conversion and the place designated for mandatory

surrender the certificates for such shares at or prior to such time), except only the rights of the
holders thereof, upon surrender of their certificate or certificates therefor (or lost certificate
affidavit and agreement), to receive the items provided for in the next sentence of this Subsection

conversion and the payment of any declared but unpaid dividends on the shares of Convertible
Stock converted. Such converted Convertible Stock shall be retired and cancelled and may not
be reissued as shares of such series, and the Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate
action (without the need for stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized
number of shares of Convertible Stock accordingly.

(c) Definitions. For purposes of this Section 5A, the following definitions

Certificate of Incorporation. Any request for redemption made pursuant to clauses (A)(iii) or (B)
above shall be a “Redemption Request’. Within ten (10) days of a Public Offering or upon an
Acquisition Event, the Corporation shall be obligated to redeem one hundred percent (100%) of
the shares of Series A Preferred Stock (such dates, respectively, the “Public Offering

the Acquisition Redemption Date and the Request Redemption Dates as a “Redemption Date”).
On each Request Redemption Date, the Corporation shall redeem, on a pro rata basis in
accordance with the number of shares of Series Preferred Stock, owned by each holder, that
number of outstanding shares of Series Preferred Stock determined by dividing (i) the total
number of shares of Series Preferred Stock, outstanding immediately prior to such Request
Redemption Date by (ii) the number of remaining Request Redemption Dates (including the
Request Redemption Date to which such calculation applies). If the Corporation does not have
sufficient funds legally available to redeem on any Redemption Date all shares of Series
Preferred Stock, as the case may be, and of any other class or series of stock to be redeemed on
such Redemption Date, the Corporation shall redeem a pro rata portion of each holder’s
redeemable shares of such stock out of funds legally available therefor, based on the respective
amounts which would otherwise be payable in respect of the shares to be redeemed if the legally
available funds were sufficient to redeem all such shares, and shall redeem the remaining shares
to have been redeemed as soon as practicable after the Corporation has funds legally available
therefor.

(b) Redemption Notice. Written notice of the mandatory redemption (the
“Redemption Notice”) shall be mailed, postage prepaid, to each holder of record of Series A
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock or
Series E Preferred Stock, as the case may be, at its post office address last shown on the records

the General Corporation Law, (i) not less than 40 days prior to a Request Redemption Date and
(ii) in-the case of a Public Offering Redemption Date or an Acquisition Redemption Date, as
soon as practicable prior to such event. Each Redemption Notice shall state:

(II) the Redemption Date and the Redemption Price;

-27-

USIDOCS 7445555v6

the manner and at the place designated, his, her or
its certificate or certificates representing the shares
of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred
Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred
Stock or Series E Preferred Stock, as the case may
be, to be redeemed.

(c) Surrender of Certificates; Payment. On or before the applicable
Redemption Date, each holder of shares of Series Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such
Redemption Date shall surrender the certificate or certificates representing such shares to the
Corporation, in the manner and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice, and thereupon
the Redemption Price for such shares shall be payable to the order of the person whose name
appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof, and each surrendered certificate
shall be canceled and retired. In the event less than all of the shares of Series Preferred Stock
represented by a certificate are redeemed, a new certificate representing the unredeemed shares
of Series Preferred Stock shall promptly be issued to such holder.

(d) Rights Subsequent to Redemption. If the Redemption Notice shall have
been duly given, and if on the applicable Redemption Date the Redemption Price payable upon
redemption of the shares of Series Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such Redemption Date is
paid or tendered for payment or deposited with an independent payment agent so as to be
available therefor, then notwithstanding that the certificates evidencing any of the shares of
Series Preferred Stock so called for redemption shall not have been surrendered, dividends with
respect to such shares of Series Preferred Stock shall cease to accrue after such Redemption Date
and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith after the Redemption Date terminate,
except only the right of the holders to receive the Redemption Price without interest upon
surrender of their certificate or certificates therefor.

(e) Redeemed or Otherwise Acquired Shares. Any shares of Series Preferred
Stock which are redeemed or otherwise acquired by the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries
shall be automatically and immediately canceled and shall not be reissued, sold or transferred.
Neither the Corporation nor any of its subsidiaries may exercise any rights granted to the holders
of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D
Preferred Stock or Series E Preferred Stock following redemption of the Series A Preferred
Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock, the Series C Preferred Stock, the Series D Preferred Stock or
the Series E Preferred Stock, as the case may be.

(f) Failure to Redeem. In the event that the Corporation fails on any
Redemption Date to redeem the full number of shares of Series Preferred Stock scheduled to be
redeemed on such Redemption Date, for any reason including, but not limited to, lack of
sufficient legally available funds, then, beginning on such default date and continuing until such
time as all of the Series Preferred Stock required to have been redeemed on such Redemption
Date shall have been redeemed in full. the total number of directors constituting the entire Board
of Directors shall automatically be increased by two (2) and the holders of the Series Preferred

-28-

USIDOCS 7445555v6
Stock shall immediately have the right to designate the two (2) new members of the Board of
Directors.

or (ii) any holder of Series Preferred Stock or any partner, member, director, stockholder,
employee or agent of any such holder, other than someone who is an employee of the

transaction or interest is presented to, or acquired, created or developed by, or otherwise comes
into the possession of, a Covered Person expressly and solely in such Covered Person's capacity
as a director of the Corporation.

8. Waiver. Any of the rights. powers, preferences and other terms of the Series
Preferred Stock set forth herein may be waived by the affirmative consent or vote of the holders
of a majority of the shares of Series Preferred Stock then outstanding unless such waiver
concerns rights which are unique to any series of Preferred Stock, in which case such waiver

the shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock then outstanding in the case of
any waiver unique to the Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, (ii) 60% of the
shares of Series C Preferred Stock then outstanding in the case of any waiver unique to the Series

The Corporation shall indemnify each person who was or is a party or threatened to be made a
party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by
reason of the fact that he or she is or was, or has agreed to become, a director or officer of the
Corporation, or is or was serving, or has agreed to serve, at the request of the Corporation, as a
director, officer, partner, employee or trustee of, or in a similar capacity with. another
corporation, partnership, joint venture. trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit
plan) (all such persons being referred to hereafter as an “Indemnitee”), or by reason of any action
alleged to have been taken or omitted in such capacity, against all expenses (including attorneys”
fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by or on
behalf of Indemnitee in connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal
therefrom, if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably
believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any
criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was
unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement,
conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a

-29-

USIDOCS 7445555v6
presumption that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee
reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, and, with
respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his or her
conduct was unlawful.

2. Actions or Suits by or in the Right of the Corporation. The Corporation shall
indemnify any Indemnitee who was or is a party to or threatened to be made a party to any
threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a
judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that Indemnitee is or was, or has agreed to become, a
director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving, or has agreed to serve. at the request
of the Corporation, as a director, officer, partner, employee or trustee of, or in a similar capacity
with, another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any
employee benefit plan), or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in such
capacity, against all expenses (including attorneys’ fees) and, to the extent permitted by law,
amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in
connection with such action. suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if Indemnitee acted in
good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the
best interests of the Corporation, except that no indemnification shall be made under this Section
2 in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which Indemnitee shall have been adjudged to be
liable to the Corporation, unless, and only to the extent, that the Court of Chancery of Delaware
shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of such liability but in view of all
the circumstances of the case, Indemnitee is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such
expenses (including attorneys’ fees) which the Court of Chancery of Delaware shall deem
proper.

3. Indemnification for Expenses of Successful Party. Notwithstanding any other

provisions of this Article, to the extent that an Indemnitee has been successful. on the merits or
otherwise, in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Sections | and 2 of this
Article FIFTH, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, or on appeal from any such
action, suit or proceeding, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all expenses (including
attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection
therewith.

4. Notification and Defense of Claim. As a condition precedent to an Indemnitee’s
right to be indemnified, such Indemnitee must notify the Corporation in writing as soon as
practicable of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation involving such Indemnitee for which
indemnity will or could be sought. With respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation
of which the Corporation is so notified, the Corporation will be entitled to participate therein at
its own expense and/or to assume the defense thereof at its own expense, with legal counsel
reasonably acceptable to Indemnitee. After notice from the Corporation to Indemnitec of its
election so to assume such defense, the Corporation shall not be liable to Indemnitee for any
legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by Indemnitee in connection with such action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, other than as provided below in this Section 4. Indemnitee shall
have the right to employ his or her own counsel in connection with such action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, but the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred after notice from the
Corporation of its assumption of the defense thereof shall be at the expense of Indemnitee unless
(i) the employment of counsel by Indemnitee has been authorized by the Corporation, (ii)

-30-

USIDOCS 74455556
counsel to Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest or
position on any significant issue between the Corporation and Indemnitee in the conduct of the
defense of such action, suit, proceeding or investigation or (iii) the Corporation shall not in fact
have employed counsel to assume the defense of such action, suit, proceeding or investigation, in
each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel for Indemnitee shall be at the expense of
the Corporation, except as otherwise expressly provided by this Article. The Corporation shall
not be entitled. without the consent of Indemnitee, to assume the defense of any claim brought by
or in the right of the Corporation or as to which counsel for Indemnitee shall have reasonably
made the conclusion provided for in clause (ii) above. The Corporation shall not be required to
indemnify Indemnitee under this Article FIFTH for any amounts paid in settlement of any action,
Suit, proceeding or investigation effected without its written consent. The Corporation shal! not
settle any action, suit, proceeding or investigation in any manner which would impose any
penalty or limitation on Indemnitee without Indemnitee’s written consent. Neither the
Corporation nor Indemnitee will unreasonably withhold or delay its consent to any proposed
settlement.

5. Advance of Expenses. Subject to the provisions of Section 6 of this Article
FIFTH, in the event that the Corporation does not assume the defense pursuant to Section 4 of
this Article FIFTH of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation of which the Corporation
receives notice under this Article, any expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by or on
behalf of an Indemnitee in defending an action, suit, proceeding or investigation or any appeal
therefrom shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such matter:
provided, however, that the payment of such expenses incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in
advance of the final disposition of such matter shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking
by or on behalf of Indemnitee to repay all amounts so advanced in the event that it shall
ultimately be determined that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as
authorized in this Article; and further provided that no such advancement of expenses shall be
made under this Article FIFTH if it is determined (in the manner described in Section 6) that (i)
Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or
not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, or (il) with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding, Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. Such
undertaking shall be accepted without reference to the financial ability of Indemnitee to make
such repayment.

6. Procedure for Indemnification. In order to obtain indemnification or
advancement of expenses pursuant to Section 1, 2, 3 or 5 of this Article FIFTH, an Indemnitee
shall submit to the Corporation a written request. Any such advancement of expenses shall be
made promptly, and in any event within 30 days after receipt by the Corporation of the written
request of Indemnitee, unless the Corporation determines within such 30 day period that
Indemnitee did not meet the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1, 2 or 5 of this
Article FIFTH, as the case may be. Any such indemnification, unless ordered by a court, shall
be made with respect to requests under Section | or 2 only as authorized in the specific case
upon a determination by the Corporation that the indemnification of Indemnitee is proper
because Indemnitce has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section | or 2, as the
case may be. Such determination shall be made in each instance (a) by a majority vote of the
directors of the Corporation consisting of persons who are not at that time parties to the action,
suit or proceeding in question (“disinterested directors”), whether or not a quorum, (b) by a

-3]-

USIDOCS 7445585v6
committee of disinterested directors designated by majority vote of disinterested directors,
whether or not a quorum, (c) if there are no disinterested directors, or if the disinterested
directors so direct, by independent legal counsel (who may, to the extent permitted by law, be
regular legal counsel to the Corporation) in a written opinion, or (d) by the stockholders of the
