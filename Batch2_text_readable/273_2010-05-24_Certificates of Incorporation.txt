affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding Voting Preferred Stock,
after first giving effect, if in connection with a Public Offering which is not a Qualified Public
Offering, to any adjustment of the Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock to which it

Series A-1 Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the
then effective Conversion Price upon the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of
the outstanding Series A-1 Preferred Stock, and (ii) each share of Series B Preferred Stock shall
automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the then effective Conversion Price
upon the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding Series B

Conversion Pricc.

(ec) | Upon the occurrence of an event specified in Section II(c), the Preferred Stock
shall be converted automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and
whether or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its
transfer agent for the Preferred Stock; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be
obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such
conversion unless certificates evidencing such shares of the Preferred Stock being converted are
either delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent, or the holder notifies the Corporation or
its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen, or destroyed and executes an
agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred
by it in connection therewith and, if the Corporation so elects, provides an appropriate indemnity
bond. Upon the automatic conversion of the Preferred Stock pursuant to Section L(c), the
holders of such Preferred Stock shall surrender the certificates representing such shares at the
office of the Corporation or of its transfer agent. Thereupon, there shall be issued and delivered
to such holder, promptly at such office and in his name as shown on such surrendered certificate
or certificates, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which
the shares of the Preferred Stock surrendered were convertible on the date on which such
automatic conversion occurred. From and after the date of the event that causes the automatic
conversion, all rights of the holder with respect to the Preferred Stock so converted shall
terminate, except only the right of such holder, upon the surrender of such holder’s certificate or
certificates therefor, to receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock issuable
upon conversion thereof.

(f Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into full
shares of Common Stock (except as provided in Section III(c)), such holder shall surrender the
certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of its transfer
agent for the Preferred Stock and shall give written notice to the Corporation at such office that
the holder elects to convert the same and shall state therein the holder’s name or the name or
names of the holder’s nominee in which the holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares
of Common Stock to be issued. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue
and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to the holder’s nominee, a
certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which the holder shall be
entitled as aforesaid, together with cash in lieu of any fraction of a share. Such conversion shall
be deemed to have been made on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be
converted and notice as herein provided, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares
of Common Stock issuable upon conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder
or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date or, if such date is a weekend or legal
holiday, the next succeeding business day. From and after such date, all nights of the holder with
respect to the Preferred Stock so converted shall terminate.

(ii) (1) — Inthe event thal the Corporation at any time or from time to time
after May 25, 2010 shall issue any Options or Convertible Securities or shall fix a record date for
the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive any such Options or
Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of shares (as set forth in the instrument
relating thereto without regard to any provisions contained therein for a subsequent adjustment
of such number) of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case of
Convertible Securities and Options therefor, the exercise of such Options and conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to be Additional Shares of Common
Stock issued as of the time of such issue of such Options or Convertible Securities or, in case
such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, provided
that Additional Shares of Common Stock shall not be deemed to have been issued unless the
consideration per share (determined pursuant to Section II(g)(iv)) of such Additional Shares of
Common Stock would be less than the Conversion Price with respect to the Voting Preferred
Stock in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such issue, or such record date, as the case
may be, and provided further that in any such case in which Additional Shares of Common Stock
are deemed to be issued:

(A) _ no further adjustment in the Conversion Price shall be
made upon the subsequent issue of Options or Convertible Securities or shares of Common Stock
upon the exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities;

(B) — ifsuch Options or Convertible Securities by their terms
provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any increase or decrease in the consideration
payable to the Corporation, or increase or decrease in the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable, upon the exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, the Conversion Price computed
upon the original issuance thercof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto),
and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon any such increase or decrease
becoming effective, be recomputed to reflect such increase or decrease insofar as it affects the
rights of exercise under such Options or the nghts of conversion or exchange under such
Convertible Securities;

(C) upon the expiration of any such Options or any nghts of
conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities that shall not have been exercised, the
Conversion Price computed upon the original issuance thereof (or upon the occurrence of a
record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon
such expiration, be recomputed as if:

(i) in the case of Options or Convertible Securities, the
only Additional Shares of Common Stock issued were the shares of Common Stock, if any,
actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities and the consideration received therefor was the consideration actually
received by the Corporation for the issue of all such Options, plus the consideration actually
received by the Corporation upon such exercise, or the consideration actually received by the
Corporation for the issue of all such Convertible Secunities that were actually converted or
exchanged, plus the additional consideration, if any, actually received by the Corporation upon
such conversion or exchange; and
(ii) in the case of Options for Convertible Securities,
only the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were issued at
the time of issue of such Options, and the consideration received by the Corporation for the
Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been then issued was the consideration
actually received by the Corporation for the issue of all such Options, whether or not exercised,
plus the consideration deemed to have been received by the Corporation (determined pursuant to
Section III(g)(iv)) upon the issue of the Convertible Securities with respect to which such
Options were actually exercised;

(D) no readjustment pursuant to clause (B) or (C) above shall
have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price to an amount that exceeds the lower of (i)such
Conversion Price on the original adjustment date, or (ii)the Conversion Price that would have
resulted from any actual issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock between the original
adjustment date and such readjustment date:

(E) in the case of any Options that expire by their terms not
more than 30 days after the date of issue thereof, no adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be
made until the expiration or exercise of all such Options, whereupon such adjustment shall be
made in the same manner provided in clause (C) above; and

(F) — ifsuch record date shall have been fixed and such Options
or Convertible Securities are not issued on the date fixed therefor, the adjustment previously
made in the Conversion Price that became effective on such record date shall be canceled as of
the close of business on such record date, and thereafter the Conversion Price shall be adjusted
pursuant to this Section III(g)(ii) as of the actual date of their issuance.

(2) In the event the Corporation at any time or from time to time after
May 25, 2010 shall declare or pay any dividend or make any other distribution on the Common
Stock payable in Common Stock or effect a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common
Stock (by reclassification or otherwise other than by payment of a dividend in Common Stock),
then and in any such event, Additional Shares of Common Stock shall be deemed to have been
issued:

(A) in the case of any such dividend or distribution,
immediately after the close of business on the record date for the determination of holders of any
class of securities entitled to receive such dividend or distribution, or

(B) in the case of any such subdivision, when such corporate
action becomes effective.

If such record date shall have been fixed and no part of such dividend or distribution shall have
been paid or made on the date fixed therefor, the adjustment previously made in the Conversion
Price that became effective on such record date shall be canceled as of the close of business on
such record date, and thereafter the Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this

Section II](g)(ii) as of the time of actual payment of such dividend or making of such
distribution.

13
(iii) In the event the Corporation shall issue Additional Shares of Common
Stock (including, without limitation, Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued
pursuant to Section HI(g)(ii)), without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the
Conversion Price for the Voting Preferred Stock in effect on the date of and immediately prior to
such issuance (a “Dilutive Issuance’), then and in such event, the Conversion Price for the
Voting Preferred Stock (but not the Conversion Price for the Series A-2 Preferred Stock, which
shall in no event be adjusted in connection with a Dilutive Issuance) shall be reduced,
concurrently with such Dilutive Issuance, to a price (calculated to the nearest tenth of a cent)
determined by multiplying such Conversion Price for the Voting Preferred Stock by a fraction,
the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to such Dilutive Issuance plus the number of shares of Common Stock which
the aggregate consideration received or deemed to have been received by the Corporation for the
total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued or deemed to be issued would
purchase at such Conversion Price and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares
of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Dilutive Issuance plus the number of
such Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued or deemed to be issued. For the purpose of
this Section III(g){iti), all shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of shares of
Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to a Dilutive Issuance and the exercise and/or
conversion of any other outstanding Convertible Securities (excluding convertible debt with no
fixed conversion price) and all outstanding Options shall be deemed to be outstanding.

(iv) For purposes of this Section II1(g), the consideration received by the
Corporation for the issue of any Additional Shares of Common Stock shall be computed as
follows:

(1) Such consideration shall:

(A) _ insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the aggregate
amounts of cash received by the Corporation excluding amounts paid or payable for accrued
interest or accrued dividends;

(B) __ insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors of the Corporation; and

(C) in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock are issued
together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for consideration that
covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in
clauses (A) and (B) above, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation.

(2) The consideration per share received by the Corporation for
Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued pursuant to Section
IH(g)(ii)(1), relating to Options and Convertible Secunties, shall be determined by dividing (x)
the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Corporation as consideration for the
issuance of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of
additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any
provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration) payable to the

14
Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such
Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, by (y)the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set forth in the
instruments relating thercto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent
adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities.

(v) (1) _ Inthe event the Corporation shall issue Additional Shares of
Common Stock pursuant to Section III(g)(ii)(2) in a stock dividend, stock distribution or
subdivision, such Additional Shares of Common Stock shall be deemed to have been issued for
no consideration.

(2) In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be
combined or consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of
Common Stock, the applicable Conversion Price with respect to each series of Preferred Stock in
effect immediately prior to such combination or consolidation shall, concurrently with the
effectiveness of such combination or consolidation, be proportionately increased.

(vi) | No adjustment in the number of shares of Common Stock into which the
Preferred Stock is convertible shall be made, by adjustment in the Conversion Price in respect of
the issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock, unless the consideration per share for an
Additional Share of Common Stock issued or deemed to be issued by the Corporation is less than
the applicable Conversion Price in effect on the date of, and immediately prior to, the issuance of
such Additional Share.

(vii) [fat any time or from time to time there shall be a recapitalization of the
Common Stock (but not the Preferred Stock) (other than a transaction provided for elsewhere in
this Section [JI or in Section I), provision shall be made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock
shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of the Preferred Stock the number of
shares of stock or other securities or property of the Corporation or otherwise, to which a holder
of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled on such
recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the
provisions of this Section II] with respect to the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock after
the recapitalization to the end that the provisions of this Section III (including adjustment of the
Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock then in effect and the number of shares
purchasable upon conversion of each series of Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that
event as nearly equivalent as shall be reasonably practicable.

(h) Except for an amendment approved in accordance with Section II, the
Corporation shall not, by amendment of this Certificate of Incorporation or through any
reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issuance or sale of secunties
or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the
terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Corporation but shall at all times in good
faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Section ITI and in the taking of all such
action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holders
of the Preferred Stock set forth herein against impairment.

15
(1) Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the Conversion Price
pursuant to this Section III, the Corporation at its expense shall promptly compute such
adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to each holder of the
affected series of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and
showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The
Corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock, furnish
or cause to be fumished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (i)such adjustments and
readjustments, (1i)the Conversion Price at the time in effect, and (iii)the number of shares of
Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received
upon the conversion of cach share of Preferred Stock.

GQ) In the event of any taking by the Corporation of a record of the holders of any
class or series of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof who are entitled to
receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend that is the same as cash dividends paid in
previous quarters) or other distribution, the Corporation shall mail to each holder of each series
of Preferred Stock that is convertible into Common Stock, at least 10 days prior to such record

date, a notice specifying the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such
dividend or distribution.

(k) The Corporation shall reserve and keep available out of its authorized but
unissued Common Stock such number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be
sufficient to effect conversion of the Preferred Stock.

(I) The Corporation shall pay any issue or transfer taxes payable in connection with
the conversion of the Preferred Stock into Common Stock, provided, however, that the
Corporation shall not be required to pay any tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer to
a name other than that of the holder of the Preferred Stock, and no issuance or delivery need be
made unless the Corporation has been paid the amount of such tax or it has been established to
the Corporation’s satisfaction that the tax has been paid.

IV. Dividends.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section IV or in a certificate of designations
filed pursuant to the DGCL with respect to any series of Preferred Stock, the holders of shares of
Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to receive dividends.

(b) The holders of shares of the Voting Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive
dividends, out of any assets legally available thercfor, prior and in preference to any declaration
or payment of any dividend (payable other than in Common Stock or other securities and nghts
convertible into or entitling the holder thereof to receive, directly or indirectly, additional] shares
of Common Stock of the Corporation) on the Common Stock, at the applicable Dividend Rate
(as defined below), payable when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors. Such dividends
shall not be cumulative. “Dividend Rate” shall mean $.80 per annum for each share of Voting
Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any Recapitalization Event). All dividend payments pursuant to
this Section [V(b) shall be made to the holders of Voting Preferred Stock pro rata. No dividends
shall accrue or be payable with respect to the shares of the Series A-2 Preferred Stock.
(c) When and as dividends are declared payable in cash or property, other than shares
of the Corporation’s capital stock, with respect to shares of Common Stock, the Corporation
shall declare at the same time and pay to each holder of shares of Voting Preferred Stock a
dividend equal to the dividend that would have been payable to such holder if the shares of
Voting Preferred Stock held by such holder had been converted into Common Stock on the
record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such dividend.

(d) No distributions shall be declared or paid on any Common Stock of the
Corporation during any fiscal year of the Corporation until dividends in the amounts set forth in
Sections IV(b) and (c) have been paid to, or declared and set apart upon, all outstanding shares of
Voting Preferred Stock during that fiscal year.

(e) In the event the Corporation shall declare a distribution payable in securities of
other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by the Corporation or other persons, assets
(excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred to in Section III(g)(ii), in each case as
permitted hereunder, and such distribution does not constitute a Liquidation Event or a Deemed
Liquidation Event as set forth in Section I, then, in each such case for the purpose of this
Section IV, the holders of the Voting Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a proportionate share of
any such distribution as though they were the holders of the number of shares of Common Stock
into which their shares of Voting Preferred Stock are convertible as of the record date fixed for
the determination of the holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such distribution.

V. Redemption. The Preferred Stock shall not be redeemable.
