determined after the payment of any earn-outs or other contingent payments and the release of
any escrow or holdback proceeds to the stockholders of the Corporation), then such holder shall

such director or directors, given either at a special meeting of such stockholders duly called for
that purpose or pursuant to a written consent of stockholders, and any vacancy thereby created

MPI:9797113 6.
may be filled by the holders of that class or series of stock tepresented at the meeting or pursuant
to written consent.

5. Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have
conversion rights as follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

a. Right to Convert, Each share of Preferred Stock shall be
convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such
share, at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for such stock, into such number of
fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing (i) in the case
of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Original Series A Issue Price by the Conversion Price
applicable to such share, determined as hereinafter provided, in effect on the date the certificate
is surrendered for conversion, (ii) in the case of the Series B Preferred Stock, the Original
Series B Issue Price by the Conversion Price applicable to such share, determined as hereinafter
provided, in effect on the date the certificate is surrendered for conversion and (tii) in the case of
the Series C Preferred Stock, the Original Series C Issue Price by the Conversion Price
applicable to such share, determined as hereinafter provided, in effect on the date the certificate
is surrendered for conversion. The Conversion Price per share for shares of Series A Preferred
Stock (the “Series A Conversion Price”) shall initially be the Original Series A Issue Price (as
adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations or splits with respect to such shares). The
Conversion Price per share for shares of Series B Preferred Stock (the “Series B Conversion
Price”) shall initially be the Series B Original Issue Price (as adjusted for any stock dividends,
combinations or splits with respect to such shares). The Conversion Pricc per share for shares of
Series C Preferred Stock (the “Series C Conversion Price,” and together with the Series A
Conversion Price and Series B Conversion Price, a “Conversion Price” or the “Conversion
Prices”) shall initially be the Series C Original Issue Price (as adjusted for any stock dividends,
combinations or splits with respect to such shares). Such initial Series A Conversion Price,
Series B Conversion Price and Series C Conversion Price shall be adjusted as hereinafter
provided.

b. Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall
automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the then-effective applicable
Conversion Price upon the earlier, of (i) the date specified by written consent or agreement of
holders of at least sixty percent (60%) of the shares of the Preferred Stock then outstanding,
voting together as a single class on an as-converted to Common Stock basis, or (ii) immediately
upon the closing of the sale of the Corporation’s Common Stock in a firm commitment,
underwritten public offering registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
“Securities Act’), resulting in the Common Stock of the Corporation being listed for trading on a
national securitics exchange or the Nasdaq Global Market, other than a registration relating
solely to a transaction under Rule 145 under such Act (or any successor thereto) or to an
employee benefit plan of the Corporation (A) at a price per share of not less than $6.28 (as
adjusted pursuant to the terms of such agreement and as adjusted for any stock dividends,
combinations or splits with respect to such shares) and (B) the aggregate proceeds to the
Corporation (after deduction for underwriters’ discounts and expenses relating to the issuance) of
at least $25,000,000 (a “Qualified IPO”).

MPI:979711.3 7.
c. Mechanics of Conversion.

(i) Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock, he shall surrender the certificate or
certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for
such stock, and shall give written notice to the Corporation at such office that he elects to convert
the same and shall state therein the name or names in which he wishes the certificate or
certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued. The Corporation shall, as soon as
practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, a
certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which he shall be entitled
as aforesaid. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close
of business on the date of surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the
person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion
shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock
on such date,

(ii) If the conversion is in connection with an
underwritten offering of securities pursuant to the Securities Act, the conversion may, at the
option of any holder tendering shares of Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the
closing with the underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering, in which event
the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall
not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of
such sale of securities.

(ii) No Adjustment of Conversion Price. Any provision
herein to the contrary notwithstanding, other than pursuant to Section C.5(e) hereof, no

adjustment in the Conversion Price for a series of Preferred Stock shall be made in respect of the
issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock unless the consideration per share (determined

deemed to be issued by the Corporation is less than the applicable Conversion Price immediately
prior to such issue, z

(iii) Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common
Stock, In the event the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date
shall issue any Options or Convertible Securities or shall fix a record date for the determination

MP1:979711,3 9,
Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case of Convertible
Securities and Options therefor, the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, shall
be deemed to be Additional Shares of Common Stock issued as of the time of such issue or, in
case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date,
provided that in any such case in which Additional Shares of Common Stock are deemed to be
issued;

(1) no further adjustments in the Series A
Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series C Conversion Price shall be made upon
the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities or shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of
such Options or conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities;

(2) if such Options or Convertible Securities by
their terms provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any increase in the consideration
payable to the Corporation, or decrease in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable, upon
the exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, the Series A Conversion Price, Series B
Conversion Price and Series C Conversion Price computed upon the original issue thereof (or
upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based
thereon, shall, upon any such increase or decrease becoming effective, be recomputed to reflect
such increase or decrease insofar as it affects such Options or the rights of conversion or
exchange under such Convertible Securities (provided, however, that no such adjustment of the
Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series C Conversion Price shall affect
Common Stock previously issued upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock);

(3) upon the expiration of any such Options or
rights, the termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any Options
or rights related to such Convertible Securities or exchangeable securities, in each case the
issuance of which gave rise to an adjustment hereunder, the Series A Conversion Price, the
Series B Conversion Price and the Series C Conversion Price, to the extent in any way affected
by or computed using such Options, rights or Convertible Securities or Options or rights related
to such Convertible Securities, shall be recomputed to reflect the issuance of only the number of
shares of Common Stock (and convertible or exchangeable securities that remain in effect)
actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or rights, upon the conversion or exchange of
such Convertible Securities or upon the exercise of the Options or rights related to such
Convertible Securities; -

(4) no readjustment pursuant to clause (2) or (3)
above shall have the effect of increasing the Series A Conversion Price, the Series B Conversion
Price or the Series C Conversion Price to an amount which exceeds the lower of (a) the Series A
Conversion Price, the Series B Conversion Price or the Series C Conversion Price, as applicable,
on the original adjustment date, or (b) the Series A Conversion Price, the Series B Conversion
Price or the Series C Conversion Price, as applicable, that would have resulted from any issuance

MP1:979711.3 10.
(iv) Adjustment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of

Additional Shares of Common Stock. In the event this Corporation, at any time after the date of
filing of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall issue Additional Shares of
Common Stock (including Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to
Section C,5(d)(iii)) without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the
Conversion Price in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such issue, then and in such
event, (i) such applicable Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a
price (calculated to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a
fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to such issue plus the number of sharcs of Common Stock which the aggregate
consideration received by the Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of Common
Stock so issued would purchase at such Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such
issuance, and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of such Additional Shares of
Common Stock so issued. For the purpose of each of the above calculations, the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue shall be calculated on a
fully diluted basis, as if all shares of Preferred Stock and all Convertible Securities had been
fully converted into shares of Common Stock and any outstanding warrants, options or other
rights for the purchase of shares of stock or convertible securities that are outstanding had been
fully exercised (and the resulting securities fully converted into shares of Common Stock, if so
convertible) as of such date.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of
this Section C.5(d), the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional
Shares of Common Stock shall be computed as follows:

(1)  Cashand Property: Such consideration
shall:

(A) _ insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at
the aggregate amount of cash received by the Corporation excluding amounts paid or payable for
interest or dividends;

(B) _ insofar as it consists of property other than
cash, be computed at the fair value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith
by the Board of Directors of the Corporation-(including the affirmative vote of the Required
Directors); and

(C) in the event Additional Shares of Common
Stock are issued together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for
consideration which covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed
as provided in clauses (A) and (B) above, as determined in good faith by the Board (including
the affirmative vote of the Required Directors).

(2) Options and Convertible Securities, The
consideration per share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock

MP1:979711.3 11.
deemed to have been issued pursuant to Section C.5(d)(iii), relating to Options and Convertible
Securities shall be determined by dividing

(A) _ the total amount, if any, received or
receivable by the Corporation as consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible
Securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the
instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein designed to
protect against dilution) payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible
Securities, the exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities by

(B) the maximum number of shares of Common
Stock (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained
therein designed to protect against the dilution) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities.

€. Adjustments to Conversion Prices for Stock Dividends and

for Combinations or Subdivisions of Common Stock. In the event that this Corporation at any
time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall declare or pay, without
consideration, any dividend on the Common Stock payable in Common Stock or in any right to
acquire Common Stock for no consideration, or shall effect a subdivision of the outstanding
shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares of Common Stock (by stock split,
reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in Common Stock or in any right to
acquire Common Stock), or in the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be
combined or consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of -
Common Stock, then the Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock in effect
immediately prior to such event shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such event, be
proportionately decreased or increased, as appropriate. In the event that this Corporation shall
declare or pay, without consideration, any dividend on the Common Stock payable in any right
to acquire Common Stock for no consideration then the Corporation shall be deemed to have
made a dividend payable in Common Stock in an amount of shares equal to the maximum
number of shares issuable upon exercise of such rights to acquire Common Stock.

f. Adjustments for Reclassification and Reorganization. If

the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be changed into the
same or a different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock, whether by capital
reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares
provided for in Section C.5(e) above or a merger or other reorganization referred to in Section
C.2(d) above), the Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock then in effect shall,
concurrently with the effectiveness of such reorganization or reclassification, be proportionately
adjusted so that the applicable series of Preferred Stock shall be convertible into, in lieu of the
number of shares of Common Stock which the holders would otherwise have been entitled to
receive, a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock equivalent to the number of
shares of Common Stock that would have been subject to receipt by the holders upon conversion
of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock, as
applicable, immediately before that change.

g. Special Mandatory Conversion.

(i) Special Definitions. For purposes of this
Section C.5(g), “Mandatory Offering” shall mean that portion of any equity financing
consummated by the Corporation pursuant to which securities are issued at a purchase price less
than the Series C Conversion Price then in effect that the Board (including the Required
Directors) determines in good faith must be purchased pro rata among the holders of Preferred
Stock subject to the following:

(ii) In the event:

(1) this Corporation consummates an equity financing
pursuant to which any holders of Preferred Stock are entitled to exercise the right of first offer
set forth in that certain Amended and Restated Investors’ Rights Agreement, dated on or about
the Original Issue Date, by and among this Corporation and certain holders of Preferred Stock, as
amended from time to time (such right to be referred to as the “Right of First Offer” and such
agreement to be referred to as the “Rights Agreement’), irrespective of whether the Right of
First Offer is waived pursuant to the terms of the Rights Agreement;

(2) the Board of Directors of this Corporation
determines (with interested directors able to vote for purposes of this provision and with the
affirmative vote of the Required Directors) that it is in the best interests of this Corporation for
the holders of Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock of this Corporation to
participate in such financing (in which case such financing will be deemed a “Mandatory
Offering”) and determines the aggregate dollar amount to be invested by all holders of Series B
Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock (the “Aggregate Investment Amount’), which
amount may be more or less than the amount such holders have the right to invest in such
financing pursuant to the Right of First Offer;

(3) this Corporation delivers a notice (“Notice”) to
the holders of Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock (1) stating this
Corporation’s bona fide intention to consummate such financing, (2) indicating the number of
securities to be offered, (3) indicating the price and terms upon which it proposes to offer such
securities, (4) identifying the Pro Rata Share (as defined below) of each holder of Series B
Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock of the Aggregate Investment Amount, and (5)
offering each holder of Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock the right to
purchase such holder’s Pro Rata Share of the Aggregate Investment Amount within the time
periods set forth in the Notice (which shall not be less than ten (10) days); and

(4) aholder of Series B Preferred Stock or Series C
Preferred Stock or an affiliate or designee of such holder (a “Non-Participating Holder’) does
not acquire at least its Pro Rata Share of the Aggregate Investment Amount (regardless of the
total amount actually raised in such Mandatory Offering) within the time periods set forth in the
Notice;

then all shares of Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock held by such Non-
Participating Holder shall automatically and without further action on the part of such Non-

MP1:979711.3 13.
Participating Holder be converted, effective upon, subject to and concurrently with the
consummation of the Mandatory Offering (the “Ad¢andatory Offering Date’), into shares of
Common Stock of this Corporation at a Conversion Price equal to the Original Issue Price for
such series (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations or the like). For
purposes of this subsection 5(g), each holder’s Pro Rata Share of the Aggregate Investment
Amount shall be an amount determined by multiplying the Aggregate Investment Amount by a
fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of all shares of Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock then held by
such holder, and the denominator of which shall be the sum of (x) the total number of
outstanding shares of Common Stock which were issued upon conversion of shares of Series B
Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock plus (y) the total number of shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of all shares of Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred
Stock then outstanding. For purposes of calculating a holder’s Pro Rata Share, the applicable
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the shares of Series B Preferred
Stock and Series C Preferred Stock shall be calculated based on the number of shares of Series B
Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock outstanding immediately following the closing of
the Mandatory Offering and assuming full participation of all holders of Series B Preferred Stock
and Series C Preferred Stock in such Mandatory Offering. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a
holder may assign the right to participate in any future Mandatory Offering to one or more of
such holder’s affiliates, and such holder’s Pro Rata Share shall be reduced to the extent any of
such affiliates participate in such Mandatory Offering.

(iii) The holder of any shares of Series B Preferred
Stock and/or Series C Preferred Stock converted pursuant to this subsection 5(g) shall deliver to
this Corporation during regular business hours at the office of any transfer agent of this
Corporation for the Preferred Stock, or at such other place as may be designated by this
Corporation, the certificate or certificates for the shares so converted, duly endorsed or assigned
in blank or to this Corporation. As promptly as practicable thereafter, this Corporation shall
issue and deliver to such holder, at the place designated by such holder, a certificate or
certificates for the number of full shares of the Common Stock to be issued and such holder shal]
be deemed to have become a stockholder of record of Common Stock on the Mandatory Offering ©
Date, unless the transfer books of this Corporation are closed on that date, in which event such
holder shall be deemed to have become a stockholder of record of Common Stock on the next
succeeding date on which the transfer books are open.

(iv) “In the event that a holder of shares of Series B
Preferred Stock and/or Series C Preferred Stock converts any shares of such Preferred Stock into
Common Stock pursuant to subsection 5(a) hereof within ninety (90) days prior to the initial date
of closing of a Mandatory Offering, such shares shall be deemed to have been converted
pursuant to this subsection 5(g) immediately following such closing and such shares of Series B
Preferred Stock and/or Series C Preferred Stock shall be deemed to be outstanding for purposes
of calculating such holder’s Pro Rata Share of the Aggregate Investment Amount pursuant to
Section C.5(g)(4).

(¥) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
terms of Section 5(g) hereof may be waived or amended by the holders of at least sixty percent

MP1:97971 1.3 14,
(60%) of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock (voting
together as a single class on an as-converted basis).

h. No Impairment. The Corporation will not, by amendment
of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or through any reorganization,
transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other
voluntary action (except pursuant to an amendment to this Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation approved by the stockholders in accordance with the terms hereof and applicable
law), avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or
performed hereunder by the Corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying
out of all the provisions of this Section C.5 and in the taking of all such action as may be
necessary or appropriate in order to protect the Conversion Rights of the holders of the Preferred
Stock against impairment.

i. Certificates as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of
each adjustment or readjustment of any Conversion Price pursuant to this Section C.5, the
Corporation at its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in
accordance with the terms hereof and prepare and furnish to each holder of Series A Preferred
Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock a certificate executed by the
Corporation’s President or Chief Financial Officer setting forth such adjustment or readjustment
and showing in detail] the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The
Corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock, furnish
or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (1) such adjustments and
readjustments, (ii) the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock at the time in effect,
and (iii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which
at the time would be received upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock.

je Notices of Record Date. In the event that the Corporation
shall propose at any time: (i) to declare any dividend or distribution upon its Common Stock,
whether in cash, property, stock or other securities, whether or not a regular cash dividend and
whether or not out of earnings or earned surplus; (ii) to offer for subscription pro rata to the
holders of any class or series of its stock any additional shares of stock of any class or series or
other rights; (iii) to effect any reclassification or recapitalization of its Common Stock
outstanding involving a change in the Common Stock; or (iv) to merge or consolidate with or
into any other corporation, or sell, lease or convey all or substantially all of its assets, or to
liquidate, dissolve or wind up; then, in connection with each such event, the Corporation shall
send to the holders of Preferred Stock: (1) at least twenty (20) days prior written notice of the
date on which a record shall be taken for such dividend, distribution or subscription rights (and
specifying the date on which the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled thereto) or for
determining rights to vote, if any, in respect of the matters referred to in (iii) and (iv) above; and
(2) in the case of the matters referred to in (iii) and (iv) above, at least twenty (20) days prior
written notice of the date when the same shall take place (and specifying the date on which the
holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to exchange their Common Stock for securities or
other property deliverable upon the occurrence of such event).

k. Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The
Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares

MPt:979711.3 15.
of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the
Preferred Stock, such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be
sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any
time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to
effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation will
take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient
for such purpose, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite
stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to this Certificate,

1. Fractional Shares. No fractional share shall be issued upon
the conversion of any share or shares of Preferred Stock. All shares of Common Stock
(including fractions thereof) issuable upon conversion of more than one share of Preferred Stock
by a holder thereof shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the conversion
would result in the issuance of any fractional share. If, after the aforementioned aggregation, the
conversion would result in the issuance of a fraction of a share of Common Stock, the
Corporation shall, in lieu of issuing any fractional share, pay the holder otherwise entitled to
such fraction a sum in cash equal to the fair market value of such fraction on the date of
conversion (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, including the affirmative vote
of the Required Directors).

m. Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this
Section C.5 to be given to the holders of shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed given if
deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to each holder of record at
his address appearing on the books of the Corporation. Notwithstanding the other provisions of
this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, all notice periods or requirements in this
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation may be shortened or waived, either before or
after the action for which notice is required, upon the written consent of the holders of at least
sixty percent (60%) of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class
on an as-converted basis.

n. Waiver of Adjustments, Any adjustment to the Conversion
Price of any series of Preferred Stock may be waived with respect to all shares in such series
upon the written consent of the holders of at least sixty percent (60%) of the outstanding shares
of Preferred Stock (voting as a single class on an as-converted basis).

6. Restrictions and Limitations.

a. So long as any shares of Preferred Stock remain
outstanding, the Corporation shall not, without the vote or written consent of the holders of at
least sixty percent (60%) of the then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, voting together as

of Directors (including the affirmative vote of the Required Directors); or

(xi) mortgage, pledge or create a security interest in, or
cause or permit any subsidiary to mortgage, pledge or create a security interest in, any assets of
the Corporation or a subsidiary of the Corporation other than in connection with equipment
leases secured only by the leased equipment.

7. No Reissuance of Preferred Stock. No share or shares of Preferred
Stock acquired by the Corporation by reason of redemption, purchase, conversion or otherwise
