2. Preferred Stock. The preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights of
Preferred Stock, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, are as follows:

(i) Dividends. The holders of shares of the Preferred Stock and Common Stock shall not be
entitled to receive any fixed dividends thereon. Out of any assets legally available therefor, non-
cumulative cash or other types of dividends (other than fixed dividends) may be declared and paid upon
outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock at such times as the Corporation’s Board of Directors
(“Board of Directors”) may determine, whether or not any dividends are declared and paid upon Series A
Preferred Stock or Common Stock. Any such dividends shal! be payable at a rate equal to (a) 8.00% of
the Original Issue Price (as defined below) on each outstanding share of Series B Preferred Stock (as
adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reclassification and the like) per annum as is determined by the
Board of Directors, which determination shall require the approval of each of the Series B Directors. For
purposes of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the “Original Issue Price” with
respect to shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock shall equal $0.138 per share and with respect to shares of
Series A Preferred Stock shall equal $0.415702 per share (each as adjusted for stock splits, stock

number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by each holder. After payment of any dividend
declared on the Series A Preferred Stock, any additional dividends shall be distributed among the holders
of Preferred Stock and Common Stock pro rata based on the number of shares of Common Stock then

(ii) Liquidation Rights.

(a) In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation or
other distribution of assets of the Corporation among its shareholders for the purpose of winding-up the

shares of the Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any
distribution of any of the assets or surplus funds of the Corporation to the holders of the Series A
Preferred Stock or Common Stock or any other security ranking junior to the Series B Preferred Stock as
to liquidation, distributions in cash, securities or other property (valued as provided in paragraph (e¢) of
this Section Fourth.B.2(ii)) in an amount equal to the Original Issue Price for each outstanding share of
Series B Preferred Stock then held by such holder (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations,
reverse stock splits, stock splits, recapitalizations, reorganizations, reclassifications or other similar event
with respect to shares), plus all declared, but unpaid dividends thereon (such Original Issue Price as
adjusted (if applicable) and unpaid dividends together, the “Series B Preference Amount”). If upon the
occurrence of a Dissolution Event, the assets and funds legally available for distribution among the
holders of the Series B Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the
full Series B Preference Amount, then the entire assets and funds of the Corporation legally available for
distribution shall be distributed ratably among the holders of Series B Preferred Stock in proportion to the
full Series B Preference Amount each such holder is otherwise entitled to receive.

(b) After the payment to the holders of Series B Preferred Stock of the full Series B
Preference Amount, each holder of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive,
prior and in preference to any distribution of any of the assets or surplus funds of the Corporation to the
holders of the Series A Preferred Stock or Common Stock or any other security ranking junior to the
Series A Preferred Stock as to liquidation, distributions in cash, securities or other property (valued as
provided in paragraph (e) of this Section Fourth.B.2(ii)) in an amount equal to the Original Issue Price for
each outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock then held by such holder (as adjusted for any stock
dividends, combinations, reverse stock splits, stock splits, recapitalizations, reorganizations,
reclassifications or other similar event with respect to shares), plus all declared, but un-paid dividends
thereon (such Original Issue Price as adjusted (if applicable) and unpaid dividends together, the “Series A
Preference Amount”). If upon the occurrence of such an event, the assets and funds legally available for
distribution among the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit the payment
to such holders of the full Series A Preference Amount, then the entire assets and funds of the
Corporation legally available for distribution shall be distributed ratably among the holders of Series A
Preferred Stock in proportion to the full Series A Preference Amount cach such holder is otherwise
entitled to receive.

(c) Afler the payment to the holders of Series B Preferred Stock of the full Series B
Preference Amount and after the payment to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock of the full Senes A
Preference Amount as set forth above, any assets remaining in the Corporation shall be distributed among
the holders of Preferred Stock and Common Stock pro rata based on the number of shares of Common

Stock then held by each holder (assuming conversion of all such series of Preferred Stock into Common
Stock).

(d) For purposes of this Article Fourth of this Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, unless otherwise determined by the holders of at least 60% of the then outstanding shares
of Series B Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class on an As-If-Converted Basis (as herein
defined) (the “Supermajority Holders”), each of the following shall be treated as a Dissolution Event: (1)
any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation or other distribution of assets of the
Corporation among ils shareholders for the purpose of winding-up the Corporation’s affairs, whether
voluntary or involuntary, (2) the closing of the sale, transfer, lease or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the Corporation’s assets (including, but not limited to, the licensing of all or
substantially all of the intellectual property assets of the Corporation to one or more third parties), (3) the
consummation of a merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into another entity (except a
merger or consolidation in which the holders of capital stock of the Corporation immediately prior to such
merger or consolidation continue to hold at least 50% of the voting power of the capital stock of the
Corporation or the surviving or acquiring entity), or (4) the closing of the transfer (whether by merger,
consolidation or otherwise), in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to a person or group of
affiliated persons (other than an underwriter of the Corporation’s securities), of the Corporation’s
securities if, after such closing and as a result of such transaction(s), the Corporation’s shareholders
before such event would own as a result of their ownership of the Corporation's securities before such
event fifty percent (50%) or less of the Corporation's voting securities afler such event; provided,
however, that a transaction shall not constitute a Dissolution Event if its sole purpose is to change the
state of the Corporation's incorporation or to create a holding company that will be owned in substantially
the same proportions by the persons who held the Corporation’s securities immediately prior to such
transaction. Notwithstanding the prior sentence, the sale of shares of any class or series of stock of the
Corporation to bona fide institutional investors in a financing transaction shall not be deemed a
“Dissolution Event.” The treatment of any particular transaction or series of related transactions as a
Dissolution Event may be waived by the vote or written consent of the Supermajority Holders.

(e) Whenever the distribution provided for in this Section Fourth.B.2(ii) shall be
payable in securities or property other than cash, the value of such distribution shall be the Fair Market
Value (as defined herein) of such securities or other properly. For purposes of this Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, “Fair Market Value” shall mean the fair market value as agreed upon by a
majority of the disinterested directors of the Corporation and the Supermajority Holders, and in the event
that the Corporation and the Supermajority Holders do not agree upon the fair market value, then the Fair
Market Value shall be as determined by an independent third party appraiser without taking into
consideration any discount for minority positions.

(iii) | Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion nights as follows:

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shal] be convertible, in whole or
in part, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share at the office
of the Corporation or any transfer agent for such stock, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable
shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Original Issue Price applicable to such share of
Preferred Stock (plus any declared but unpaid dividends) by the Conversion Price applicable to such share
(the conversion rate for a series of Preferred Stock into Common Stock is referred to herein as the
“Conversion Rate” for such series), determined as hereinafter provided, in effect on the date the
certificate is surrendered for conversion in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section Fourth.B.2(iti).
The initial “Conversion Price” per share of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock shal] be
the Original Issue Price applicable to such series of Preferred Stock, so that initially each share of
Preferred Stock shall be convertible into one share of Common Stock. Such initial Conversion Rate shall
be adjusted as hereinafter provided.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be
converted into shares of Common Stock at the then-effective Conversion Rate and such shares may not be
reissued by the Corporation as shares of such series upon the earlier of (A) the closing of the sale of the
Corporation’s Common Stock in a firm commitment, underwritten public offering with a nationally
recognized investment bank pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), other than a registration relating solely to a transaction under
Rule 145 under the Securities Act (or any successor thereto), al a public offering price (prior to
underwriters’ discounts and expenses) equal to or $0.414 per share (as adjusted for any stock dividends,
combinations, reverse stock splits, stock splits, recapilalizations, reorganizations, reclassifications or other
similar event with respect to shares), and in which the aggregate proceeds to the Corporation and/or any
selling shareholders (prior to underwriters’ discounts and expenses) are at least $25,000,000 (a “‘Qualified
Public Offering”); or (B) the date specified by the prior written approval of the Supermajority Holders.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion.

(1) Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled 1o convert any of
such shares into shares of Common Stock pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section Fourth.B.2(iii), such
holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates evidencing such shares, duly endorsed (or a reasonably
acceptable affidavit and indemnity undertaking in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate), at the
office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for such stock, and shall give written notice to the
Corporation at such office of the number of shares that such holder elects to so convert. The Corporation
shall, as soon as practicable thereafter (but in any event within 20 business days thereafter), issue and
deliver to such holder of Preferred Stock a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common
Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid and, if applicable, a certificate or certificates
representing any such shares of Preferred Stock that are not being so converted (but were otherwise
represented by a certificate that included shares that were being so converted). Any conversion shal! be
deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of surrender of the
certificate or certificates for the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted or, if applicable, the date of
automatic conversion pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section Fourth.B.2(iii), and the person or persons
entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all
purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date,

(11) ‘In the event of an automatic conversion pursuant to paragraph (b)(A) of
this Section Fourth.B.2(iii), the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering shares of Preferred
Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of secunties
pursuant to such offering, in which event the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock upon
conversion of the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until
immediately prior to the closing of such sale of secunties.

from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall issue any Options or Convertible Securities or shal]
fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities then entitled to receive any
such Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of shares (as set forth in the
instrument relating thereto without regard to any provisions contained therein designed to protect against
dilution) of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case of Convertible
Securities and Options for Convertible Securities, the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, shal] be deemed to be Additional Shares of Common Stock issued as of the time of such issue
or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date,
provided that in any such case in which Additional Shares of Common Stock are decmed to be issued:

(1) no further adjustments in the Conversion Rate shall be made
upon the subsequent issue of such Convertible Securities where an adjustment to the Conversion Rate had
been made on the record date, or shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of such Options or
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, in each case where an adjustment to the
Conversion Rate had been made on the record date or issue date;

(2) if such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms provide,
with the passage of time or otherwise, for any increase or decrease in the consideration payable to the
Corporation, or decrease or increase in the nuinber of shares of Common Stock issuable, upon the
exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, the Conversion Rate computed upon the original issue thereof
(or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based
thereon, shall, upon any such increase or decrease becoming effective, be recomputed to reflect such
increase or decrease insofar as it affects such Options or the rights of conversion or exchange under such
Convertible Securities (provided, however, that no such adjustment of the Conversion Rate shall affect
Common Stock previously issued upon conversion of the Preferred Stock);

(3) upon the expiration of any such Options or any rights of
conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have been exercised, the
Conversion Rate computed upon the original issuance thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date
with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon such expiration, be
recomputed as if:

(A) in the case of Options or Convertible Securities for
Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common Stock issued were the shares of Common Stock,
if any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities and the consideration received therefor was the consideration actually received by
the Corporation for the issue of all such Options, whether or not exercised, plus the consideration actually
received by the Corporation upon such exercise or for the issue of all such Convertible Securities which
were actually converted or exchanged, plus the additional consideration, if any, actually received by the
Corporation upon such conversion or exchange, and

(B) in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, only
the Convertible Securitics, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were issued at the time of
issue of such Options, and the consideration received by the Corporation for the Additional Shares of
Common Stock deemed to have been then issued was the consideration actually received by the
Corporation for the issue of all such Options, whether or not exercised, plus the consideration deemed to
have been received by the Corporation (determined pursuant to subparagraph (dV) of this Section
Fourth.B.2(iii)) upon the issue of the Convertible Securities with respect to which such Options were
actually exercised;

(4) no readjustment! pursuant to clause (2) or (3) above shal] have
the effect of increasing the Conversion Rate to an amount which exceeds the lower of (a) the Conversion
Rate on the original adjustment date, or (b) the Conversion Rate that resulted from any issuance of
Additional Shares of Common Stock, other than those Additional Shares of Common Stock causing such
readjustment, between the original adjustment date and such readjustment date;

(5) in the case of any Options which expire by their terms not more
than 30 days after the date of issue thereof, no adjustment of the Conversion Rate shal] be made until the
expiration or exercise of al] such Options, whereupon such adjustment shall be made in the same manner
provided in clause (3) above; and

(6) in the event that any adjustment described in this
subparagraph (d)(H1) is made, with respect to any Additional Shares of Common Stock that were
originally issued (or deemed issued) for a consideration per share equal to or in excess of the Original
Issue Price (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, reverse stock splits, stock splits,
recapitalizations, reorganizations, reclassifications or other similar event with respect to shares) that, had
such adjustment been made prior to such original issue date (or deemed original issue date) would have
caused such Additional Shares of Common Stock to be issued for a consideration per share fess than the
Original Issue Price (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, reverse stock splits, stock splits,
recapitalizations, reorganizations, reclassifications or other similar event with respect to shares) then in
effect, then such Additional Shares of Common Stock shall be deemed to have been issued as of the date
of any such adjustment.

(IV) Adjustment of Conversion Rate Upon Issuance of Additional Shares of
Common Stock. In the event the Corporation, at any time after the Original Issue Date, shall issue
Additional Shares of Common Stock (including Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued
pursuant to subparagraph (d)(III) of this Section Fourth.B.2(iii)) without consideration or for a
consideration per share less than the Conversion Price for the applicable series of Preferred Stock in effect
immediately prior to such issue, then and in such event, the Conversion Price for such series shall be
automatically adjusted, concurrently with such issue, in accordance with the following formula; provided,
however, that the Conversion Price for Series A Preferred Stock shall not be adjusted pursuant to this
subparagraph (d)(IV) of this Section Fourth.B.2(iii) unless and until such Additional Shares of Common
Stock are issued without consideration or for a consideration per share less than $0.138 per share (as
adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reclassification and the like):

CP,=CP, *((A+B)/(A+C))
For purposes of the foregoing formula, the following definitions shall apply:

(i) “CP,” shall mean the applicable Conversion Price for Preferred
Stock in effect immediately after such issuc of Additional Shares of Common Stock;

(2) “CP,” shall mean the applicable Conversion Price for Preferred
Stock in effect immediately prior to such issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock;

(3) “A” shall mean the fully-diluted number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock;

(4) “B” shall mean the number of shares of Common Stock that
would have been issued if such Additional Shares of Common Stock had been issued a price per share
equal to CP, (determined by dividing the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation in respect
of such issue by CP,); and

(5) “C” shall mean the number of such Additional Shares of
Common Stock actually issued in such transaction.

(V) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of paragraph (d) of this
Section Fourth.B.2(iii), the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional
Shares of Common Stock shall be computed as follows:

(1) Cash and Property. Such consideration shall:
(A) _ insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
aggregate amount of cash received by the Corporation excluding amounts paid or payable for accrued
interest or accrued dividends;

(B) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the Fair Market Value thereof ai the time of such issue; and

(C) in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock are
issued together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for consideration which

covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in clauses (A) and
(B) above.

(2) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per share
received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued
pursuant to subparagraph (d)(HI) of this Section Fourth.B.2(iii), relating to Options and Convertible
Securities shall be determined by dividing:

(A) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the
Corporation as consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the minimum
aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without
tegard to any provision contained therein designed to protect against dilution) payable to the Corporation
upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the
case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities and the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities by

({B) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as
set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein designed to
protect against dilution) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or conversion or cxchange of such
Convertible Securities.

(ec) Adjustments to Conversion Rates for Stock Dividends and for Combinations or
Subdivisions of Common Stock. In the event that the Corporation at any time or from time to time after
the Original Issue Date shall declare or pay, without consideration, any dividend on the Common Stock
payable in shares of Common Stock or in any right to acquire shares of Common Stock for no
consideration, or shall effect a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater
number of shares of Common Stock (by stock split, reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a
dividend in shares of Common Stock or in any right to acquire shares of Common Stock), or tn the event
the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined or consolidated, by reclassification or
otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then the Conversion Rate in effect
immediately prior to such event shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such event, be
proportionately decreased or increased, as appropriate. In the event that the Corporation shall declare or
pay, without consideration, any dividend on the Common Stock payable in any right to acquire shares of
Common Stock for no consideration, then the Corporation shall be deemed to have made a dividend
payable in shares of Common Stock in an amount equal to the maximum number of shares issuable upon
exercise of such rights to acquire Common Stock.

(f) Adjustments for Reclassification and Reorganization. \f{ the Common Stock
issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or a different number of
shares of any other class or classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification or
otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares provided for in paragraph (e) of this Section
Fourth.B.2(iii) above or a merger or other reorganization referred to in paragraph (d) of Section
Fourth.B.2(iii)), the Conversion Rate then in effect shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such
reorganization or reclassification, be proportionately adjusted so that the Preferred Stock shall thereafter
be convertible into, in lieu of the number of shares of Common Stock which the holders would otherwise
have been entitled to receive, a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock equivalent to the
number of shares of Common Stock that would have been received by the holders upon conversion of the
Preferred Stock immediately before that change.

(g) No Impairment. The Corporation will not, by amendment of this Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation,
merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the
observance of performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the
Corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this
Section Fourth.B.2(iii) and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to
protect the Conversion Rate against impairment.

(h) Certificates as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Conversion Rate pursuant to this Section Fourth.B.2(iii), the Corporation at its
expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and
prepare and furnish to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate executed by the Corporation’s President
or Chief Executive Officer setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts
upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon the written request at
any time of any such holder, furnish or cause to be fumished to such holder a like certificate setting forth
(i) such adjustments and readjustments, (ii) the Conversion Rate at the time in effect, and (iii) the number
of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received
upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock.

(i) Notices of Record Date. In the event that the Corporation shall propose at any
time prior to the conversion of all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock: (1) to declare any dividend
or distribution upon its Common Stock, whether in cash, property, stock or other securities, whether or
not a regular cash dividend and whether or not out of eamings or earned surplus; (II) to offer for
subscription pro rata to the holders of any class or series of its stock any additional shares of stock of any
class or series or other rights; (III) to effect any reclassification or recapitalization of its Common Stock
outstanding involving a change in the Common Stock; or (IV) to merge or consolidate with or into any
other corporation, or sell, Jease or convey all or substantially all of its assets, or to liquidate, dissolve or
wind-up; then, in connection with each such event, the Corporation shall send to the holders of Preferred
Stock:

record shall be taken for such dividend, distribution or subscription rights (and specifying the date on
which the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled thereto) or for determining rights to vote, if any, in
respect of the matters referred to in clauses (I) and (II) above; and

{j) Issue Taxes. The Corporation shal] pay any and al] issue and other taxes that
may be payable in respect of any issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock on conversion of Preferred

times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock, solely for
the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of Preferred Stock, such number of its shares of
Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares
of Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authonzed but unissued shares of Common Stock
shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, the
Corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase

such purpose, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite shareholder

fractional] share. If, after the aforementioned aggregation, the conversion would result in the issuance of a

holder otherwise entitled to such fraction a sum in cash equal to the Fair Market Value of such fraction on
the date of conversion.
