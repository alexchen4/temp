CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION
OF
ATTENSITY GROUP, INC.

The undersigned, Howard Lau, hereby certifies that:

1. He is the duly elected Chief Executive Officer of Attensity Group, Inc., a corporation
organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (hereinafter, the “Corporation”).

2. The date of filing of its original Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware was November 13, 2008, and this corporation was originally incorporated pursuant
to the Delaware General Corporation Law under the name Boghador, Inc.

3. The Certificate of Incorporation was amended and restated pursuant to the Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on
December 8, 2008, and the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware on December 22, 2008, and was further amended pursuant to two
Amendments to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware on January 21, 2009 and January 20, 2010, respectively, and was amended and
restated on January 7, 2011 (collectively, the “Certificate of Incorporation”).

3. This Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation restates, integrates and further
amends the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation as herein set forth in full:

ARTICLE I
The name of the Corporation is Attensity Group, Inc.
ARTICLE I

The address of the registered office of the Corporation in the State of Delaware is 2711
Centerville Road, Suite 400 in the City of Wilmington, County of New Castle. The name of its registered
agent at such address is Corporation Service Company.

ARTICLE Il

The nature of the business or purposes to be conducted or promoted is to engage in any lawful act
or activity for which corporations may be organized under the General Corporation Law of Delaware.

ARTICLE IV

The Corporation is authorized to issue two classes of stock, designated “Common Stock” and
“Preferred Stock,” each with a par value of $0.001 per share.

Upon the effectiveness of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, each outstanding share of the Corporation’s Common Stock
will be automatically reclassified into 0.05 of a share of Common Stock, without any action by the holder
thereof (collectively, the “Reverse Split’). No fractional shares of any share or shares of the Common
Stock shall be issued upon the Reverse Split. Whether or not fractional shares would have been issuable

WEST\247779807.4 l
upon the Reverse Split (but for the preceding sentence) shall be determined based on the total number of
shares of Common Stock held by each stockholder. In lieu of any fractional interests in shares of
Common Stock to which any stockholder would otherwise be entitled pursuant hereto, such stockholder
shall be entitled to receive a cash payment equal to the amount determined by the Board of Directors to be
the fair value of such a share multiplied by such fraction. Ail share numbers and per share amounts set
forth in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation have been adjusted for the Reverse Split.

Immediately following the Reverse Split, the total number of shares of Common Stock that the
Corporation is authorized to issue is 51,000,000 shares. The number of authorized shares of Common
Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares of Common Stock then
outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock of the Corporation entitled to
vote (voting together on an as-if-converted basis), irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of
the Delaware General Corporation Law.

Immediately following the Reverse Split, the total number of shares of Preferred Stock that the
Corporation is authorized to issue is 31,096,942 shares. The Preferred Stock may be issued from time to
time in one or more series. The first series of Preferred Stock shall be comprised of 31,096,942 shares
and shall be designated “Series AA Preferred Stock.” The relative rights, preferences, privileges and
restrictions granted to or imposed upon the Preferred Stock are as follows:

1. Dividends. The holders of the then outstanding Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
receive, when and as declared by the Board of Directors, out of assets legally available therefor, prior and
in preference to any declaration or payment of any dividend on the Common Stock (payable other than in
Common Stock or other securities or rights convertible into or entitling the holder thereof to receive,
directly or indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock), dividends at the annual rate of six percent
(6%) of the Original Series AA Price on each outstanding share of Series AA Preferred Stock, as adjusted
for any stock splits, reverse stock splits, stock dividends, and similar recapitalization events (each a
“Recapitalization Event’) , but without any adjustment for the Reverse Split. No distribution shall be
paid on any share of Common Stock until all declared dividends on the Preferred Stock have been paid or
set aside for payment to the Preferred Stock holders. The right to dividends on shares of Preferred Stock
shall not be cumulative, and no right shall be accrued to holders of Preferred Stock by reason of the fact
that dividends on said shares are not declared in any period, nor shall any undeclared or unpaid dividend
bear or accrue interest.

2. Liquidation Preference. In the event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation, either voluntary or involuntary, the assets and funds of the Corporation available for
distribution to stockholders shall be distributed as follows:

(a) First, the holders of shares of Series AA Preferred Stock then outstanding shall
be entitled to receive, out of the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders,
before any payment shall be made in respect of the Corporation’s Common Stock, an amount equal to
$1.474906 per share of Series AA Preferred Stock, as adjusted for any Recapitalization Events, but
without any adjustment for the Reverse Split (the “Series AA Preference Amount’), plus ail declared and
unpaid dividends thereon to the date fixed for such distribution. If, upon the occurrence of such event, the
assets of the Corporation legally available for distribution are insufficient to permit the payment to the
holders of Series AA Preferred Stock of the full Series AA Preference Amount, then the entire assets
available for distribution to stockholders shall be distributed to the holders of the Series AA Preferred
Stock ratably in proportion to the Series AA Preference Amount which they would be entitled to receive
pursuant to the preceding sentence of this Section 2(a).

WEST\247779807.4 2
(b) After the full preferential amount due the holders of Preferred Stock pursuant to
Section 2(a) have been paid or set aside, any remaining assets of the Corporation available for distribution
to its stockholders shall be distributed to the holders of Common Stock and Series AA Preferred Stock
ratably in proportion to the number of shares of Common Stock then held by each holder or issuable upon
conversion of shares of Series AA Preferred Stock then held by each Holder.

(c) (i) A merger or consolidation of the Corporation into or with another entity after
which the stockholders of the Corporation immediately prior to such transaction do not own, immediately
following the consummation of the transaction by virtue of their shares in the Corporation or securities
received in exchange for such shares in connection with the transaction, a majority of the voting power of
the surviving entity in proportions substantially identical to those that existed immediately prior to such
transaction and with substantially the same rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions as the shares
they held immediately prior to the transaction, or (ii) the sale, transfer or other disposition (but not
including a transfer or disposition by pledge or mortgage to a bona fide lender) of all or substantially all
of the assets of the Corporation (other than to a wholly owned subsidiary) shall be deemed to be a
liquidation of the Corporation as that term is used in this Section 2. The treatment of any particular
transaction or series of related transactions as a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation
may be waived by the vote or written consent of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of
all then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class and on an as-converted
basis).

(d) In the event of any liquidation of the Corporation involving the distribution of
assets other than cash to the stockholders of the Corporation, the value of the assets to be distributed shall
be determined as follows:

(i) In the case of securities that are not subject to investment letter or other
similar restrictions on free tradability,

(A) if traded on a national securities exchange, the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities over the 10 day period ending three days
prior to the closing;

(B) if actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be deemed to
be the average of (i) the average of the last bid and ask prices or (ii) the closing sale prices (whichever is
applicable) over the 30 day period ending three days prior to the closing; and

(C) if there is no active public market, the value shall be the fair
market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Corporation and the holders of at least a majority of
the voting power of all then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock.

(ii) In the case of securities subject to investment letter or other restrictions
on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of a stockholder’s status as an
affiliate or former affiliate), the value shall be based on an appropriate discount from the market value
determined as above in Section 2(d)(i) to reflect the approximate fair market value thereof, as mutually
determined by the Corporation and the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class and on an as-converted basis).

(iii) In the case of any other property, the value shall be equal to the
property’s fair market value, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

WEST\247779807.4 3
3. Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as follows:

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Series AA Preferred Stock shall be convertible,
at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share, at the office of the
Corporation or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, into a number of fully paid and nonassessable
shares of Common Stock equal to $3.524117 (the “Original Series AA Price’), divided by the
Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock in effect at the time of conversion. The Conversion
Price for the Series AA Preferred Stock initially shall be the Original Series AA Price, subject to
adjustment as provided in Section 3(d) below, but without any adjustment for the Reverse Split.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be
converted into fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock, at the then effective Conversion
Price, upon (i) the vote or written consent of at least a majority of the voting power represented by the
then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class and on an as-converted basis)
or (ii) the closing of a firm commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration
statement on Form S-1 (or a successor form) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended covering the
offer and sale of Common Stock at an offering price per share of not less than two and one half times
(2.5x) the Original Series AA Price, as adjusted for any Recapitalization Event, but without any
adjustment for the Reverse Split, with aggregate gross proceeds to the Corporation (prior to underwriters’
commissions and expenses) of not less than $50,000,000.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the certificate or
certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the headquarters of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for the
Corporation and shall give written notice to the Corporation at such office that the holder elects to convert
the same and shall state therein the name or names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of
Common Stock are to be issued (except that no such written notice of election to convert shall be
necessary in the event of an automatic conversion pursuant to Section 3(b) hereof). The Corporation
shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock,
or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of
Common Stock to which he shall be entitled as aforesaid. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been
made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred
Stock to be converted (except that, in the case of an automatic conversion upon an initial public offering
pursuant to Section 3(b), such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the
closing of the offering) and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable
upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of
Common Stock on such date. Upon the occurrence of either of the events specified in Section 3(b) above,
the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically without any further action by
the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to
the Corporation or its transfer agent; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to
issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion unless either the
certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent
as provided above, or the holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have
been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the
Corporation against any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates.

WEST\247779807.4 4
(d) Adjustments to Conversion Price for Dilutive Issuances.

(i) Special Definitions. For purposes of this Section 3(d), the following
definitions shall apply:

(A) “Original Issue Date” shall mean, with respect to any series of
Preferred Stock, the date on which shares of such series are first issued by the Corporation.

(B) “Additional Shares of Common Stock’ shall mean all shares of
Common Stock issued (or, pursuant to Section 3(d)(ii) below, deemed to be issued) by the Corporation
after the Original Issue Date, other than:

(1) shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of
Preferred Stock;

(2) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable to officers,
directors or employees of, or consultants to, the Corporation pursuant to any stock option plan or
agreement or other stock incentive program or agreement approved by the Board of Directors;

(3) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable to landlords,
equipment lessors, lenders or other financial institutions in a commercial transaction or arrangement
approved by the Board of Directors;

(4) shares issued in connection with the acquisition by the
Corporation of voting control or all or substantially all of the assets of another business entity in a
transaction approved by the Board of Directors;

(5) shares for which an adjustment is made pursuant to
Section 3(d)(v);

(6) shares issued in connection with acquisitions of
technology or intellectual property in transactions that are approved by the Board of Directors; or

(7) shares issued in any transaction approved by the holders
of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class and on
an as-converted basis).

(C) “Options” shall mean rights, options or warrants to subscribe for,
purchase or otherwise acquire either Common Stock or Convertible Securities (as defined below).

(D) “Convertible Securities” shall mean any evidences of
indebtedness, shares of Preferred Stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common
Stock.

(ii) Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock. In the event
the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall issue any Options or
Convertible Securities or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities
entitled to receive any such Options or Convertible Securities, then the following provisions shall apply:

(A) The maximum number of shares (as set forth in the instrument
relating thereto without regard to any provisions contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such

WEST\247779807.4 5
number) of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Options or upon the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities shall be deemed to be Additional Shares of Common Stock
issued as of the time of the issuance of such Option or Convertible Security or, in case such a record date
shal! have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date.

(B) Except as provided in paragraphs (C) and (D) below, no further
adjustment in the Conversion Price shall be made upon the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities or
shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities.

(C) If such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms provide,
with the passage of time or otherwise, for any change in the consideration payable to the Corporation or
the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange thereof (other
than a change resulting from the antidilution provisions of such Options or Convertible Securities), the
Conversion Price computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with
respect thereto) and any subsequent adjustments based thereon shall, upon any such increase or decrease
becoming effective, be recomputed to reflect such increase or decrease insofar as it affects such Options
or the rights of conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities; provided, however, that such
recomputed Conversion Price shall not exceed the Conversion Price that would have been in effect had
the original issuance of Options or Convertible Securities not been deemed to constitute an issuance of
Additional Shares of Common Stock.

(D) Upon the expiration of any such Options or Convertible
Securities, the Conversion Price, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such Options or
Convertible Securities, shall be recomputed to reflect the issuance of only the number of shares of
Common Stock actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or Convertible Securities.

(iii) Adjustment of Conversion Price for Dilutive Issuances. In the event
the Corporation shall issue Additional Shares of Common Stock (including Additional Shares of
Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to Section 3(d)(ii)) after the Original Issue Date of any
series of Preferred Stock without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Conversion
Price for such series in effect immediately prior to such issuance, then and in each such event the
Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock shall be reduced to a price (rounded to the nearest one
tenth of one cent) equal to such Conversion Price multiplied by a fraction:

(x) the numerator of which is equal to the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding or deemed to be outstanding immediately prior to such issuance plus the
number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for
the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued would purchase at the Conversion
Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance; and

(y) the denominator of which is equal to the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding or deemed to be outstanding immediately prior to such issuance plus the
number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued.

For the purposes of this paragraph (iii), the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be outstanding

shall be deemed to include the Common Stock issuable upon full exercise and conversion of all then
outstanding Options and Convertible Securities.

WEST\247779807.4 6
(iv) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this Section 3(d), the
consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional Shares of Common Stock shall
be computed as follows:

(A) Cash and Property. Such consideration shall:

(1) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the aggregate
amount of cash received by the Corporation before deducting any reasonable discounts, commissions or
other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the Corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in
connection with the issuance and sale thereof:

(2) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors; and

(3) in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock are issued
together with other securities or other assets of the Corporation for consideration that covers both, be the
proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in clauses (1) and (2) above, as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(B) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per
share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued
pursuant to Section 3(d) relating to Options and Convertible Securities shall be equal to:

(x) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the
Corporation as consideration for the issuance of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the
minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto,
without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration)
payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options
for Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, divided by

(y) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as
set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a
subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities.

(v) Other Adjustments to Conversion Price.

(A) Subdivisions, Combinations or Consolidations of Common
Stock. In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided, combined or
consolidated, by stock split, reverse stock split or similar event, into a greater or lesser number of shares
of Common Stock after the Original Issue Date of a series of Preferred Stock, the Conversion Price for
such series in effect immediately prior to such subdivision, combination or consolidation shall,
concurrently with the effectiveness of such subdivision, combination or consolidation, be proportionately
adjusted.

(B) Common Stock Dividends and Distributions. If, after the
Original Issue Date of a series of Preferred Stock, the Corporation at any time or from time to time issues,
or fixes a record date for determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or
other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock, then in each such event, as of the time

WEST\247779807.4 7
of such issuance or, in the event such record date is fixed, as of the close of business on such record date,
the Conversion Price for such series that is then in effect shall be decreased by multiplying the
Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction, (x) the numerator of which is the number of shares of
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of
business on such record date, and (y) the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of business on such
record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or
distribution; provided, however, that if such record date is fixed and such dividend or distribution is not
paid in full on the date fixed therefor, the Conversion Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the
close of business on such record date and thereafter the Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to
this Section 3(d)(v)(B) to reflect the actual payment of such dividend or distribution.

(C) Other Distributions. In case the Corporation shall distribute to
holders of its Common Stock shares of its capital stock (other than shares of Common Stock and other
than as otherwise subject to adjustment pursuant to this Section 3(d)), stock or other securities of other
persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by the Corporation or other persons, assets (excluding cash
dividends) or options or rights (excluding options to purchase and rights to subscribe for Common Stock
or other securities of the Corporation convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock), or shall fix a
record date for determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such a distribution, then, in
each such case, provision shall be made so that the holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive,
upon conversion thereof, in addition to the number of shares of Common Stock receivable thereupon, the
amount of securities of the Corporation that they would have received had their Preferred Stock been
converted into Common Stock on the date of such event (or on the record date with respect thereto, if
such record date is fixed) and had they thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to and
including the date of conversion, retained such securities receivable by them as aforesaid during such
period, subject to all other adjustments called for during such period under this Section 3 with respect to
the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock.

(D) Recapitalizations and Reorganizations. In the case of any
capital recapitalization or reorganization (other than a subdivision, combination or other recapitalization
provided for elsewhere in this Section 3 or a merger or sale of assets provided for in Section 2), or the
fixing of any record date for determination of holders of Common Stock affected by such recapitalization
or reorganization, provision shall be made so that the holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
receive, upon conversion thereof, the type and number of shares of stock or other securities or property of
the Corporation or otherwise that they would have received had their Preferred Stock been converted into
Common Stock on the date of such event (or on the record date with respect thereto, if such record date is
fixed) and had they thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to and including the date of
conversion, retained such securities receivable by them as aforesaid during such period, subject to all
other adjustments called for during such period under this Section 3 with respect to the rights of the
holders of the Preferred Stock. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application
of the provisions of this Section 3 to the end that the provisions of this Section 3 shall be applicable after
the recapitalization or reorganization to the greatest extent practicable.

(e) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Conversion Price for a series of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 3, the
Corporation at its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with
the terms hereof and furnish to each holder of a share of such series of Preferred Stock a certificate setting
forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or
readjustment is based including the consideration received for any Additional Shares of Common Stock
issued. The Corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of a Preferred Stock,
furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and

WEST\247779807.4 8
readjustments, (ii) the Conversion Price at the time in effect for the series of Preferred Stock held by such
holder and (iii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the type and amount, if any, of other property
which at the time would be received upon the conversion of a share of such series of Preferred Stock.

(f) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon
conversion of shares of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder of Preferred
Stock would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the
fair market value of one share of Common Stock as determined by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation. The number of whole shares issuable to each holder of a series of Preferred Stock upon
such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of the total number of shares of such series being converted into Common Stock by such
holder at that time.

(g) Notices of Record Date. In the event (i) the Corporation shall take a record of
the holders of its capital stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend or other distribution
(other than a cash dividend) or to subscribe for or purchase any shares of stock of any class or to receive
any other rights, (ii) of any capital reorganization, reclassification or recapitalization (other than a
subdivision or combination of its outstanding shares of Common Stock), or (iii) of the voluntary or
involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Corporation or any transaction deemed to be a
liquidation pursuant to Section 2, then, and in any such case, the Corporation shall cause to be mailed to
each holder of record of the Preferred Stock at the address of record of such stockholder as set forth on
the Corporation’s books, at least 20 days prior to the earliest date hereinafter specified, a notice stating the
material terms of the proposed transaction and the date on which (x) a record is to be taken for the
purpose of such dividend, distribution or rights or (y) such reorganization, reclassification,
recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is to take place and the date, if any is to be fixed,
as of which holders of capital stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their shares of capital stock for
securities or other property deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization,
dissolution, liquidation or winding up; provided, however, that such notice period may be shortened upon
the written consent of holders of Preferred Stock that are entitled to such notice rights or similar notice
rights and that represent at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of such
Preferred Stock. If any material change in the facts set forth in the written notice shall occur, the
Corporation shall promptly give written notice of such material change to each holder of shares of
Preferred Stock.

(h) No Impairment. Without obtaining such consent of the holders of Preferred
Stock as may be required under Section 6, the Corporation will not, by amendment of its Certificate of
Incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or
sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of
any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Corporation, but will at all times in good
faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Section 3 and in the taking of all such action as
may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holders of Preferred Stock
against impairment.

(i) Reservation of Stock Issuable upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at all
times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock, solely for
the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Preferred Stock, such number of its shares of Common
Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall
not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, the Corporation
will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its

WEST\247779807.4 9
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such
purpose.

() At the time of conversion, pursuant to Sections 3(a) or 3(b) above, of the Series
AA Preferred Stock in connection with the Corporation’s underwritten initial public offering, the holders
of Series AA Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, in cash, an amount per share of Series AA
Preferred Stock equal to the Series AA Preference Amount plus all declared and unpaid dividends as of
such date of conversion; provided, however, upon the written election of the holders of a majority o the
voting power represented by the then outstanding shares of Series AA Preferred Stock (voting as a
separate series), the holders of Series AA Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive, in lieu of the
aforementioned cash payment, shares of Common Stock in an amount equal to the quotient obtained by
dividing (i) the total amount of payment due to such holder of Series AA Preferred Stock by (ii) the price
per share of Common Stock offered and issued to the public by the Corporation.

4, Voting Rights.

(a) General. Each holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a number of votes
equal to the number of whole shares of Common Stock into which such holder’s shares of Preferred Stock
could then be converted and, except as otherwise required by law or as set forth herein, shall have voting
rights and powers equal to the voting rights and powers of the Common Stock. Each holder of Preferred
Stock shall be entitled to notice of any stockholders’ meeting in accordance with the Bylaws of the
Corporation and shall be entitled to vote with the holders of Common Stock with respect to any matter
upon which holders of Common Stock have the right to vote, except as otherwise provided herein or
those matters required by law to be submitted to a class vote.

(b) Election of Directors. At each election of directors of the Corporation the
holders of Preferred Stock and Common Stock, voting together as a single class on an as-converted basis,
shall be entitled to elect all directors of the Corporation.

5. Protective Provisions. So long as any shares of Preferred Stock are outstanding, the
Corporation shall not, without first obtaining the affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of a
majority of the voting power represented by the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (voting
together as a single class and on an as-converted basis):

(a) enter into transaction or series of related transactions involving a merger or
consolidation with another entity, or a sale, conveyance or disposal of all or substantially all of its assets,
unless the stockholders of the Corporation immediately prior to such transaction own, immediately
following the consummation of the transaction by virtue of their shares in the Corporation or securities
received in exchange for such shares in connection with the transaction, a majority of the voting power of
the surviving or purchasing entity in proportions substantially similar to those that existed immediately
prior to such transaction and with substantially the same rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions as
the shares they held immediately prior to the transaction;

(b) modify the rights, preferences, privileges or restrictions of the Preferred Stock so
as to adversely affect the Series AA Preferred Stock;

(c) increase the total number of authorized shares of Series AA Preferred Stock or
Common Stock;

WEST\247779807.4 10
