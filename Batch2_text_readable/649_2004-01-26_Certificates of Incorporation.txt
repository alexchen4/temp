such Series C Preferred Stock.

If the assets and funds thus available for distribution among the holders of the Series C
Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of their full aforesaid
preferential amount, then the entire amount of the assets and funds of the Company legally
available for distribution shall be distributed ratably among the holders of the Series C Preferred
Stock in proportion to the aggregate Liquidation Preference, plus all declared and unpaid dividends
on the Series C Preferred Stock, for the shares of such Preferred Stock owned by each such holder.

CATEMP\PALIB2_2651744_5 (2),DOC ~4-
(c): Shares not Treated as both Preferred Stock and Common Stock in any

Distribution. Shares of Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to be converted into shares of
Common Stock in order to participate in any distribution, or series of distributions, as shares of
Common Stock, without first foregoing participation in the distribution, or series of distributions,
as shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to Subsection (a) above.

(d) Deemed Liquidation. For purposes of this Section 3, unless the holders of at
least a majority of the Preferred Stock then outstanding shall determine otherwise, a liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Company shall be deemed to be occasioned by, or to include,

results in the transfer of more than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding voting power of the
Company; or (B) a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company (each of (A) and (B),
an “Acquisition or Asset Transfer’’).

(e) Non-Cash Distribution. Whenever the distribution provided for in this
Section 3 shall be payable in securities or property other than cash, the value of such distribution
’ shall be the fair market value of such securities or other property as determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors,

4, Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as
- follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the
option of the holder thereof, at any time at the office of the Company or any transfer agent for the
Preferred Stock, into that number of fully-paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock that is
equal to the Original Issue Price divided by the appropriate “Conversion Price.” The initial
Conversion Price per share of each series of Preferred Stock shall be the Original Issue Price of
such series and shall be subject to adjustment as provided herein. The number of shares of

. Common Stock into which each share of a series of Preferred Stock may be converted is hereinafter
referred to as the “Conversion Rate” for each such series. Upon any decrease or increase in the
Conversion Price or the Conversion Rate for a series, as described in this Section 4, the
corresponding Conversion Rate or Conversion Price for such series, as the case may be, shall be
appropriately increased or decreased.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be

- converted into shares of Common Stock at the then effective Conversion Rate for such share
immediately upon the earlier of (i) the consummation of a public offering of Common Stock
registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which is either the subject of a firm
underwriting commitment or an on-line offering pursuant to the Dutch-auction process; provided
that the aggregate gross proceeds to the Company are not less than $20,000,000 (before deducting
underwriting discounts, commissions or fees) (2 “Qualifying Public Offering”) and (ii) with
respect to all shares of Preferred Stock of a particular series, the date of written consent of
agreement of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of such series of Preferred
Stock, voting together on an as-converted basis.

CATEMP\PALIB2_2651744_5 (2).D0C -5-
(c) | Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be
issued upon conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder
would otherwise be entitled, the Company shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the
then fair market value of such fractional shares as determined by the Board of Directors of the
Company. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into full
shares of Common Stock, and to receive certificates therefor, he shall surrender the certificate or
certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Company or of any transfer agent for the
Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the Company at such office that he elects to
convert the same; provided, however, that in the event of an automatic conversion pursuant to
Subsection 4(b) above, the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically
without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates
representing such shares are surrendered to the Company or its transfer agent; provided, further,
that the Company shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common
Stock issuable upon such automatic conversion unless either the certificates evidencing such shares
of Preferred Stock are delivered to the Company or its transfer agent as provided above, or the
holder notifies the Company or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or
destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Company to indemnify the Company from
any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates.

The Company shall, as soon as practicable after such delivery, or after such agreement and
indemnification, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which he shall be entitled as aforesaid
and a check payable to the holder in the amount of any cash amounts payable as the result of a
conversion into fractional shares of Common Stock, plus any declared and unpaid dividends on the
converted Preferred Stock. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior
to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be
converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon
such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of
Common Stock on such date; provided, however, that if the conversion is in connection with a
public offering or a Liquidation Event, the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering
Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing of the sale of securities pursuant to
such public offering or Liquidation Event, in which event the person(s) entitled to receive the
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have
converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing or consummation of the
public offering or Liquidation Event, subject to the Conversion Price adjustment, if any, pursuant
to Subsection 4(e)(iv) below.

(d). Conversion Price Adjustments for Sales of Shares Below Conversion Prices.
The Conversion Prices of the Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as
follows:

(i) (A) (1) Except with respect to issuances for which an adjustment
is made pursuant to Subsection 4(d)(i)(A)(2) below, if the Company shall issue, after the Original
Issue Date of any series of Preferred Stock, any Additional Stock (as defined below) without

consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Conversion Price for any series of
Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock, the
Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to each such issuance for such series of Preferred

CATEMP\PALIB2._2651744_5 (2).D0C -6-
Stock shall automatically (except as otherwise provided in this Subsection 4(d)(i)) be adjusted to a
price determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, (x) the numerator of which
shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance
(the “Outstanding Common”) plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate
consideration received by the Company for such issuance would purchase at such Conversion
Price; and (y) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Outstanding Common
plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock. For purposes of the foregoing calculation, the
term “Outstanding Common” shall include shares of Common Stock deemed issued pursuant to
Subsection 4(d)(@)(E). Notwithstanding the above, no adjustment shall be made to the Conversion
Price of any Nonparticipating Shares following their classification of the holder of such shares as a
Nonparticipating Investor pursuant to Subsection 4(f)().

@) (A) (2) If this Company, at any time on or before the ninetieth day
following the Original Issue Date for the Series C Preferred Stock, shall issue any Additional Stock
(or deemed to have been issued pursuant to Section 4(d)(i)(E)) without consideration or for a
consideration per share less than the Conversion Price for Series C Preferred Stock in effect on the
date of and immediately prior to such issue, then, and in such event, the Conversion Price for the
Series C Preferred Stock shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price equal to the price
paid per share for such Additional Stock. Notwithstanding the above, no adjustment shall be made
to the Conversion Price of any Nonparticipating Shares following their classification of the holder
of such shares as a Nonparticipating Investor pursuant to Subsection 4(f)(i).

(B) No adjustment of the Conversion Price for any series of
Preferred Stock shall be made in an amount less than one cent per share; provided that any
adjustments which are not required to be made by reason of this sentence shall be carried forward.
and shall be either taken into account in any subsequent adjustment made prior to three years from
the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward, or shall be made at the end
of three years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward.
Except to the limited extent provided for in Subsections 4(d)(i)(E)(3) and 4(d)()@)(4), no
adjustment of such Conversion Price pursuant to this Subsection 4(d)(i) shali have the effect of
increasing the Conversion Price above the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock in
effect immediately prior to such adjustment.

(C) Inthe case of the issuance of Additional Stock for cash, the
consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting any
reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the Company for
any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

(D) Inthe case of the issuance of the Additional Stock for a
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be deemed
to be the fair value thereof as determined by the Board of Directors irrespective of any accounting
treatment.

(E) Inthe case of the issuance (whether before, on or after the

applicable Original Issue Date) of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common Stock,
securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock or options to purchase

consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in Subsections
4(d)(i)(C) and 4(a)(i)(D) hereof), if any, received by the Company upon the issuance of such
options or rights plus the minimum exercise price provided in such options or rights (without.
taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) for the Common Stock covered thereby.

(2) The aggregate maximum number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of or in exchange (assuming the satisfaction of any

exchangeable securities or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such
convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof shall be
deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or such options or rights were
issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration, if any, received by the Company for any
such securities and related options or rights (excluding any cash received on account of accrued
interest or accrued dividends), plus the minimum additional consideration, if any, to be received by
the Company (without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) upon the conversion
or exchange of such securities or the exercise of any related options or rights (the consideration in
each case to be determined in the manner provided in Subsections 4(d)(i)(C) and 4(d)()@)
hereof).

exchange of such securities,

related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Conversion Price of any series of
Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, rights or
securities or options or rights related to such securities, shall be recomputed to reflect the issuance
of only the number of shares of Common Stock (and convertible or exchangeable securities which
remain in effect) actually issued upon the exercise of such options or rights, upon the conversion or
exchange of such securities or upon the exercise of the options or rights related to such securities.

Reclassifications and Reorganizations. The Conversion Prices of the Preferred Stock shall be
subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

(i) Adjustments for Subdivisions, Combinations or Consolidations of
Common Stock. If the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided (by stock split,
stock dividend, or otherwise) into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion
Prices in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of
such subdivision, be proportionately decreased. If the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall
‘be combined or consolidated (by reclassification, reverse stock split or otherwise) into a lesser
number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Prices in effect immediately prior to such
combination or consolidation shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination or
consolidation, be proportionately increased.

(ii) Adjustments for Other Distributions. If the Company at any time or
from time to time makes or fixes a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock
entitled to receive any distribution payable in securities of the Company other than shares of
Common Stock and other than as otherwise adjusted in this Section 4, then and in each such event
provision shall be made so that the holders of Preferred Stock shall receive upon such distribution
the amount of securities of the Company which they would have received had their Preferred Stock
converted into Common Stock on the date of such event and had they thereafter, during the period
from the date of such event to and including the date of conversion, retained such securities
receivable by them as aforesaid during such period, subject to all other adjustments called for
during such period under this Section 4 with respect to the rights of the holders of the Preferred
Stock,

(iii) | Adjustments for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. If the
‘Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or a
different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization,
reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares provided for
above), the Conversion Prices then in effect shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such
reorganization or reclassification, be proportionately adjusted such that the Preferred Stock shall be
convertible into, in lieu of the number of shares of Common Stock which the holders would
otherwise have been entitled to receive, a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock
equivalent to the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been subject to receipt by
the holders upon conversion of the Preferred Stock immediately before that change.

(iv) Reorganizations, Mergers or Consolidations. If at any time or from
time to time, there is a capital reorganization of the Common Stock or the merger or consolidation

CXTEMPPALIB2_2651744_5 (2).D0C -10-
of the Company with or into another corporation or another entity or person (other than an
Acquisition or Asset Transfer as defined in Subsection 3(d) or a recapitalization, subdivision,
combination, reclassification, exchange or substitution of shares provided for elsewhere in this
Section 4), as a part of such capital reorganization, merger or consolidation, provision shall be
made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon
conversion of the Preferred Stock held by them the number of shares of stock or other securities or
property of the Company to which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable
upon conversion would have been entitled on such capital reorganization, merger or consolidation.
In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this
Section 4 with respect to the rights of the holders of Preferred Stock after the capital
reorganization, merger or consolidation to the end that the provisions of this Section 4 (including

~ adjustment of the Conversion Price then in effect and the number of shares issuable upon
conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event and be as nearly equivalent as
practicable.

(f) | Conversion of Non Participating Preferred Stock to Common Stock.

~ (i) ‘In the event the Company proposes to undertake an Equity Security
Issuance after the date of filing of this Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, it
shall give (or have given prior to the date of filing of this Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation) each holder of Preferred Stock written notice (the “Issuance Notice”) of its
intention, describing the type of new securities, the price and number of shares and the general
terms upon which the Company proposes to issue such new securities, at least ten (10) days prior to
the date of such Equity Security Issuance, or such other period of time agreed to by a
majority-in-interest of the holders of Preferred Stock. Each holder of Preferred Stock may within
‘five (5) days from the date of receipt of the Issuance Notice, or such other period of time agreed to
by a majority-in-interest of the holders of Preferred Stock (the “Response Period’) provide written
notice to the Company that such holder agrees to become a Participating Investor for the price and .
upon the terms specified in the Issuance Notice. In the event that such holder (taking into account
commitments or purchases made by an affiliate of such holder on such holders’ behalf where prior
