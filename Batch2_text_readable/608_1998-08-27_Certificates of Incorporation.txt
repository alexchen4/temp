NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Directors hereby
fixes and determines the designation of, the number of shares constituting, and: the
rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions relating to, said first series of Preferred
Stock in this Certificate of Determination of Preferences of Series A Preferred Stock
(“Certificate”) as follows: -

(a) The first series of Preferred Stock has been designated “Series A
Convertible Preferred Stock” (herein “Series A Preferred”). The Series A Preferred
shall have no par value.
(b} The number of shares constituting the Series A Preferred shall be
2,414,635 shares (the Series A Preferred”),

(a) The holders of shares of Series A Preferred shall be entitled to
receive dividends if, when and as declared by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation. The right to receive dividends on Series A Preferred shall be non-
cumulative, and no right to dividends shall accrue by reason of the fact that no dividend
has been declared on the Series A Preferred in any prior year,

(b) The Corporation shall not declare or pay any distribution (as
defined below) on shares of Common Stock until the holders of the Series A Preferred
then outstanding shall have first received a distribution at the same rate per share, as is
declared on Shares of Common Stock, treating each share of Series A Preferred as if
converted into Common Stock adjusted in accordance with the anti-dilution provisions
of Section 5.

(©) For purposes of this Section 1, unless the context requires
otherwise, “distribution” shall mean the transfer of cash or property without
consideration, whether by way of dividend or otherwise, payable other than in Common
Stock or other securities of the Corporation, or the purchase or ivJemption of shares of
the Corporation (other than repurchases of Common Stock held: by employees or
directors of, or consultants to, the Corporation upon termination of their employment
or services pursuant to agreements providing for such repurchase at a price not -
exceeding fair market value of such shares for cash or property, including any such
transfer, purchase or redemption by a subsidiary of this Corporation, but excluding
distributions upon the liquidation or dissolution of the Corporation.

(a) In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation,
dissojution or winding up of the Corporation, the holders of shares of Series A
Preferred then outstanding shall be entitled to be ‘paid out of the assets of the
Corporation available for distribution to its shareholders, before any payment shall be
made to the holders of Common Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount
equal to $4.54 per share (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock
dividend, stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization affecting such
shares), plus any dividends declared but unpaid on such shares.

Corporation in which the shareholders of the Corporation’s Common Stock (the Series

2
A Preferred deemed to be fully converted) immediately prior to such event do not own
@ majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the surviving corporation
immediately after such event, will be deemed to be a liquidation.

If upon any such liquidation, dissolution or winditig up of the Corporation the
assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders shall be
insufficient to. pay the holders of shares of Series A Preferred the full preferential
amcunt to which they shall be entitled pursuant to the above provisions, the entire
assets and funds of the Corporation available for distribution shall be distributed solely
among the holders of the Series A Preferred ratably in proportion to the full preferential
amounts which would otherwise be payable in respect of the shares heid by them upon
such distribution.

(b) After payment of all preferential amounts required to be paid to
the holders of Series A Preferred, upon the dissojution, liquidation or winding up of the
Corporation, the remaining assets and funds of the Corporation available for
distribution shall be distributed in equal amounts per share to the holders of Series A
Preferred and the holders of Common Stock (treating each share of Series A Preferred
as if converted into Common Stock). ,

4. Voting.

Each hoider of outstanding shares of Series A Preferred shall be entitled
to the number of votes equal to the number of whole shares of Common Stock into
which the shares of Series A Preferred held by such holders are then convertible (as
adjusted from time to time pursuant to Section 5 hereof}, at each meeting of

stockholders of the Corporation (and written actions of shareholders in lieu of meetings)
with respect to any and all matters presented to the shareholders of the Corporation for
their action or consideration. Except as provided by law, or by the provisions of
Section 8 below, holders of Series A Preferred shall vote together with the holders of
Common Stock as a single class.

5. Optional Conversion. The holders of the Series A Preferred shal) have
conversion rights as follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

(2) Right to Convert. Each share of Series A Preferred shall be
convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time and from time to time, and
without the payment of additional consideration by the holder thereof, into such number
of fully paid and nonassessabie shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing
$4.54 by the Conversion Price (as. defined below) in effect at the time of conversion.
The “Conversion Price” shall initiaily be $4.54. Such initial Conversion Price, and the
Tate at which shares of Series A Preferred may be converted into shares of Common

Stock, shall be subject to adjustment as provided below.
(6) Eractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shail
be issued upon conversion of the Series A Preferred. In fieu of any fractional shares to

which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to
such fraction multiplied by the then effective Conversion Price.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion.

(i) In order for a holder of Series A Preferred to convert
shares of Series A Preferred into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender
the certificate or certificates for such shares of Series A Preferred, at the office of the
transfer agent for the Series A Preferred (or at the principal office of the Corporation if
the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent), together with written notice that such
holder zlects to convert all or any number of the shares of the Series A Preferred
represented by such certificate or certificates. Such notice shall state such holder's
name or the names of the nominees in which such holder wishes the certificate or
certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued. If required by the Corporation,
certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by a written
instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly
executed by the registered holder or his or its attorney duly authorized in writing. The
date of receipt of such certificates and notice by the transfer agent (or by the
Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own. transfer agent) shall be the conversion.
date (“Conversion Date”). The Corporation shall; as soon as practicable after the
Conversion Date, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Series A Preferred,
or to his or its nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of
Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled, together with cash in lieu of any
fraction of a share.

Gi) | The Corporation shall at all times when the: Series A
Preferred shall be outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but
unissued stock, for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Series A Preferred,
such number of its duly authorized shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time
be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding Series A Preferred. Before
taking any action which would cause an adjustment reducing the Conversion Price
below the then par value, if any, of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of the Series A Preferred, the Corporation will take any corporate action
which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Corporation
may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessabie shares of Common Stock at
such adjusted Conversion Price.

(iii) Upon any such conversion, no adjustment to the
Conversion Price shall be made for any declared but urpaid dividends on the Series A
Preferred surrendered for conversion or on the Common Stock delivered upon
conversion, which unpaid dividends shali remain payable in accordance with the terms
of such declaration.
@) All shares of Series A Preferred which shall have been

receive notices and to vote, shall immediately cease and terminate on the Conversion
Date, except only the zight of the holders thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in
exchange therefor and payment of any dividends declared but unpaid thereon, and the
person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor
Shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holdezs of such shares of
Common Stock at the close of business on the Conversion Date. Any shares of Series
A Preferred so converted shall be retired and cancelled and shail not be reissued, and
the Corporation (without the need for stockholder action) may from time to time take
such appropriate action as may be necessary to reduce the authorized Series A Preferred
accordingly.

(v) The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and other
taxes that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of Common
Stock upon conversion of shares of Series A Preferred pursuant to this Section 5. The
Corporation shall not, however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in
respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of shares of Common
Stock in a name other than that in which the Shares of Series A Preferred so converted
were registered, and no such issuance or delivery shall be made unless and until the
person or entity requesting such issuance has paid to the Corporation the amount of any
such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax has been

paid.

adjustments based thereon, shall, upon any such increase or decrease becoming
effective, be recomputed to reflect such increase or decrease insofar as it affects such
Options or the rights of conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities;

(C) Upon the expiration or termination of any
unexercised Option, the Conversion Price computed on the original issuance thereof,
and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shali be recomputed to reflect such
termination; .

(D) In the event of any change in the number of shares
of Common Stock issuabie upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any Option or
Convertibie Security, including, but not limited to, a change resulting from the anti-
dilution provisions thereof, the Conversion Price then in effect shall forthwith be

4
converted prior to such change been made upon the basis of such change; and

(E) No readjustment pursuant to clause (B) or (D)
above shali have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price to an amount which
exceeds the lower of (i) the Conversion Price as in effect on the original adjustment
date applicable to the Options or Convertible Securities actually exercised or converted,
as the case may be, or (ii) the Conversion Price that would have been in effect as of the
date of such readjustment as a result of any issuances of Additional Shares of Common
Stock between such original adjustment date and such readjustment date.

In the event the Corporation, after the Original Issue Date, amends the terms of
any Options or Convertible Securities (whether such Options or convertible Securities
were outstanding on the Original Issue Date or were issued after the Original Issue

stock split or combination as: provided. in Subsection 3{e) or upon a dividend or
distribution as provided in Subsection 5(f), without consideration or for a consideration
per share less than the Conversion Price in effect on the date of and immediately prior
fo such issue, then and in such event, such Conversion Price shall be reduced,
concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest cent) determined by

(1) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue
plus (2) the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration
received or to be received by the Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares
of Common Stock so issued would purchase at such Conversion Price; and (B) the
denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to such issue plus the number of such Additional Shares of Common
Stock so issued; provided that for the purpose of this Subsection 5“d)(iv), all shares of

@® insofar as it consists of cash, be computed
at the aggregate of cash received by the Corporation, excluding amounts paid or
payabie for accrued interest;

(I) insofar as it consists of property other than
cash, be computed at the fair market value thereof at the time of such issue, as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors; and

Board of Directors.

receivable by the Corporation as consideration for the issue of such Options or
Conivertible Securities, plus the miximum aggregate amount of additional consideration
(as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision .
contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration) payable to the
Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities, or in the case of Opticns for Convertible Securities, the exercise

combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price then in effect
immediately before the combination shall be proportionately increased. Any adjustment
under this paragraph shall become effective-at the close of business on the date the
subdivision or combination becomes effective.
(f) wiustment for Certain Dividends and Distributions. In the event
the Corporation at any time, or from time to time, after the Original Issue Date shall
make or issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock
entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of
Common Stock, then and in each such event the Conversion Price then in effect shall be

decreased as of the time of such issuance or, in the event such a record date shall have
_ been fixed, as of the close of business on such record: date, by multiplying the
Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction:

(1) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of
Common Stczk issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the time of such issuance or the close of business on such
record date, and oo

(2) the denominator of whir‘s shell be the total number of shares
of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the time of such issuance or the close of business on such
record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution; :

provided, however, if such record date shall have ‘been fixed-and such dividend is not
fully paid, or if such distribution is not fully made-on the date fixed therefor, the
Conversion Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such
record date and thereafter the Conversion ‘Price shali- be adjusted. pursuant ‘to: this
paragraph as of the time of actual payment of such dividends -or' distributions; and
provided further, however, that no such adjustment ‘shall bé made if the holders. of

thereof in addition to the number of shares of Common Stock receivable thereupon, the
amount of securities of the Corporation that they would have received had the Series A
Preferred been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event and had they
thereafter, during the period from the date of such eveiit to. and including the
conversion date, retained such securities receivable by them as aforesaid during such
period, giving application to all adjustments called for during such period under this

Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred shail be changed

into the same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock, whether
by capital reorganization, reclassification, or otherwise (other than a subdivision or

securities or property to which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of
the Corporation deliverable upon conversion of such Series A Preferred would have
been entitled upon such consolidation, merger or sale; and, in such case, appropriate.

Common Stock in a firmly underwritten public offering or a direct public pursuant to
an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, in
which the aggregate purchase price to the public equals or exceeds $15,000,000 and the
per share offering price is at least $12.00 (appropriately adjusted in the event of any
stock dividend, stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization affecting such
shares), or (ii) the vote or affirmative written consent of the holders of a majority of the
Series A Preferred (the “Mandatory Conversion Date”), all outstanding shares of Series
A Preferred shall automaticzily be converted into shares of Commion Stock, at the then
effective Conversion Price, and thereafter all references herein to the Series A
Preferred shall be deleted and shall be of no further force or effect.

(b) All holders of record of shares of Series A Preferred shall be
given written notice of the Mandatory Conversion Date and. the place designated for
mandatory conversion of ali such shares of Series A Preferred pursuatit to this Section
6. Such notice need not be given in advance of the occurrence of the Mandatory
Conversion Date. Such notice shall be sent by first class or registered mail, postage
prepaid, to each record holder of Series A Preferred at such holder’s address last shown
on the records of the transfer agent for the Series A Preferred (or the records of the
Corporation, if it serves as its own transfer agent). Upon receipt of such notice, each
holder of shares of Series A Preferred shall surrender his or its certificate or certificates
for all such shares to the Corporation at the place designated in such notice, and shall
thereafter receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such

delivered to such hoider, or on his or its written order, a certificate or certificates for
the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable on such conversion in accordance
with the provisions hereof and cash as provided in Subsection 5(b) in respect of any

13
fraction or a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion.

(c) All certificates evidencing shares of Series A Preferred which are
required to be surrendered for conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof
shall, from and after the Mandatory Conversion Date, be deemed to have been retired
and cancelled and the shares of Series A Preferred represented thereby converted into
Common Stock for ali purposes, notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders
thereof to surrender such certificates on or prior to such date, and the person or persons
entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be
treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock
at the close of business on the Mandatory Conversion Date. The Corporation may
thereafter take such appropriate action (without the need for stockholder action) as may
be necessary to reduce the authorized Series A Preferred accordingly.

7. Redemption. Subject to the provisions of the California General
Corporation Law and to any other applicable legal restrictions on the right of a
corporation to redeem its own shares, the Series A Preferred shall be redeemed by the
