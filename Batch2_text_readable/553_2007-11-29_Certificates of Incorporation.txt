3. Conversion. The Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as
follows:

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Series A-3 Preferred Stock
shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of
such share into that number of fully-paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock that is
equal to $1.00 divided by the Series A-3 Conversion Price (as hereinafter defined). The ‘Series
A-3 Conversion Price” shall initially be $1.00, and shall be subject to adjustment as provided
herein. Each share of Series A-2 Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of the holder
thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share into that number of fully-paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock that is equal to $1.00 divided by the Series A-2
Conversion Price (as hereinafter defined). The “Series A-2 Conversion Price” shall initially be
$1.00, and shall be subject to adjustment as provided herein. Each share of Series A-1 Preferred
Stock shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of
issuance of such share into that number of fully-paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock
that is equal to $0.56486 divided by the Series A-1 Conversion Price (as hereinafter defined).
The “Series A-1_ Conversion Price” shall initially be $0.56486, and shall be subject to
adjustment as provided herein. Shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall not be convertible at the
option of the holder thereof.

(b) Automatic Conversion. All shares of Preferred Stock shall
automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the then effective applicable
Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock immediately upon the date upon which the
Company receives the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of more than 70% of the then
outstanding Series A-3 Preferred Stock, Series A-2 Preferred Stock and Series A-1 Preferred
Stock, voting together as a single class. All shares of Preferred Stock shall automatically be
converted into shares of Common Stock at the then effective applicable Conversion Price for
such series of Preferred Stock immediately upon the consummation of a firmly underwritten
public offering pursuant to a registration statement (other than a registration statement relating
solely to a transaction under Rule 145 of the Securities Act or to an employee benefit plan of the
Company) covering the offer and sale of the Common Stock and declared effective by the
Securities and Exchange Commission, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities
Act”), provided, however. that (a) the per share price offered to the public is not less than $5.00
(as adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification or other similar event) and (b) the aggregate gross proceeds
(prior to underwriting discounts, commissions and expenses) to the Company are not less than
$40,000,000. The “Series A Conversion Price” shall initially be $0.50, and shall be subject to
adjustment as provided herein.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of
Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional
shares to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the Company shall pay the fair market
A-6

$V\589779.4
value cash equivalent of such fractional share as determined by the Board of Directors of the
Company. For such purpose, all shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder shall be
aggregated, and any resulting fractional share of Common Stock shall be paid in cash. Before
any holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into full shares of Common
Stock, and to receive certificates therefor, he shall either (A) surrender the Preferred Stock
certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Company or of any transfer
agent for the Preferred Stock or (B) notify the Company or its transfer agent that such certificates
have been lost, stolen or destroyed and execute an agreement satisfactory to the Company to
indemnify the Company from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates, and
shall give written notice to the Company at such office that such holder elects to convert such
shares; provided, however, that in the event of an automatic conversion pursuant to Section 3(b)
above, the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically without any
further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates representing such
shares are surrendered to the Company or its transfer agent; provided further, however, that the
Company shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon such automatic conversion unless either the certificates evidencing such shares of
Preferred Stock are delivered to the Company or its transfer agent as provided above, or the
holder notifies the Company or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or
destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Company to indemnify the Company
from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates. On the date of the occurrence
of an automatic conversion, each holder of record of shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed
to be the holder of record of the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, notwithstanding
that the certificates representing such shares of Preferred Stock shall not have been surrendered
at the office of the Company, that notice from the Company shall not have been received by any
holder of record of shares of Preferred Stock, or that the certificates evidencing such shares of
Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered to such holder.

The Company shall, as soon as practicable after such delivery, or after
such agreement and indemnification, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred
Stock, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which he shall
be entitled as aforesaid and a check payable to the holder in the amount of any cash amounts
payable as the result of a conversion into fractional shares of Common Stock, plus any declared
but unpaid dividends on the converted Preferred Stock. Such conversion shall be deemed to
have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the
shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares
of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record
holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date; provided, however, that if the
conversion is in connection with an underwritten offer of securities registered pursuant to the
Securities Act, the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering Preferred Stock for
conversion, be conditioned upon the closing of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering, in
which event the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion
of the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until
immediately prior to the closing of the sale of such securities.

(d) Adjustments to Conversion Price.

(i) Adjustments for Subdivisions, Dividends or
Combinations. After the date of the filing of this Amended and Restated Certificate of

Incorporation, if the Company shall declare or pay without any consideration any dividends on
the Common Stock payable in Common Stock or in any right to acquire Common Stock, or if the
outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided (by stock split, stock dividend or
otherwise), into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the applicable Conversion Price in
effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such
subdivision, be proportionately decreased. After the date of the filing of this Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation, if the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be
combined (by reclassification or otherwise) into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, the
applicable Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such combination shall, concurrently
with the effectiveness of such combination, be proportionately increased.

Gi) Adjustments for Reclassification, Exchange and
Substitution. If the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be

changed into the same or a different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock,
whether by capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a stock split, dividend
or combination of shares provided for in Section 3(d)(i) above), the applicable Conversion Price
then in effect shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such reorganization or reclassification,
be proportionately adjusted such that the Preferred Stock shall be convertible into, in lieu of the
number of shares of Common Stock which the holders would otherwise have been entitled to
receive, a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock equivalent to the number of
shares of Common Stock that would have been subject to receipt by the holders upon conversion
of the Preferred Stock immediately before that change.

(iii) Adjustments for Dilutive Issuances.

(A) After the date of the filing of this Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, if the Company shall issue or sell any Additional
Shares of Common (as actually issued or, pursuant to paragraph (C) below, deemed to be issued)
for a consideration per share less than the Conversion Price with respect to the Series A-3
Preferred Stock, the Series A-2 Preferred Stock or the Series A-1 Preferred Stock in effect
immediately prior to such issue or sale, then immediately upon such issue or sale the respective
Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock shall be reduced to a price (calculated to the
nearest hundredth of a cent) determined by multiplying such prior respective Conversion Price
by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of “Calculated Securities”
(defined below) outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale plus the number of
Additional Shares of Common which the aggregate consideration received by the Company for
the total number of Additional Shares of Common so issued or sold would purchase at such prior
Conversion Price, and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Calculated
Securities outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale plus the number of Additional
Shares of Common so issued or sold. “Calculated Securities” means: (i) all shares of Common
Stock actually outstanding; (ii) all shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the then
outstanding Preferred Stock (without giving effect to any adjustments to the conversion price of
any series of Preferred Stock as a result of such issuance); (iii) and all shares of Common Stock

A-8

issuable upon exercise and/or conversion of outstanding options, warrants or other rights for the
purchase of shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock; and (iv) all shares of Common Stock
reserved for future issuance pursuant to employee stock option or incentive equity plans (not
including those shares already subject to inclusion in the definition of Calculated Securities
pursuant to the foregoing clause (iii) above).

(B) For the purposes of paragraph (A) above,

subscribe for, or any rights or options to purchase, Convertible Securities, whether or not such
rights or options or the right to convert or exchange any such Convertible Securities are
immediately exercisable, the price per share for which Additional Shares of Common are

exchange of the total maximum amount of such Convertible Securities issuable upon the exercise
of such rights or options shall (as of the date of granting of such rights or options) be deemed to
be outstanding Additional Shares of Common and to have been issued for such price per share,

(2) In case at any time the Company
shall issue or sell any Convertible Securities, whether or not the rights to exchange or convert
thereunder are immediately exercisable, the price per share for which Additional Shares of
Common are issuable upon such conversion or exchange shall be determined by dividing (x) the
total amount received or receivable by the Company as consideration for the issue or sale of such
Convertible Securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any,
payable to the Company upon the conversion or exchange thereof, by (y) the total maximum
number of Additional Shares of Common issuable upon the conversion or exchange of all such
Convertible Securities. If the price per share for such Additional Shares of Common shall be

A-10

SV1589779.4
less than the Series A-3 Conversion Price, the Series A-2 Conversion Price or the Series A-1
Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the time of such issue or sale, then the total
maximum number of Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities shall (as of the date of the issue or sale of such Convertible Securities) be deemed to
be outstanding Additional Shares of Common and to have been issued for such price per share,
provided that if any such issue or sale of such Convertible Securities is made upon exercise of
any rights to subscribe for or to purchase or any option to purchase any such Convertible
Securities for which adjustments of the conversion price have been or are to be made pursuant to
other provisions of this paragraph (C), no further adjustment of the conversion price shall be
made by reason of such issue or sale.

(3) upon the expiration of any such
Convertible Securities or any rights of conversion or exchange under such Convertible
Securities, which shall not have been exercised, the Series A-3 Conversion Price, the Series A-2
Conversion Price or the Series A-1 Conversion Price, as applicable, computed upon the original
issue thereof (or deemed issuance thereof or the record date with respect thereto) and any
subsequent adjustments based thereon shall, upon such expiration, be recomputed as if the only
Additional Shares of Common issued were the shares of Common Stock, if any, actually issued
upon the exercise of such Convertible Securities or the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities and the consideration received therefor was the consideration actually
received by the Company for the issue of such exercised Convertible Securities or rights to
subscribe for, or any rights or options to purchase Convertible Securities, plus the consideration
actually received by the Company upon such exercise or for the issue of all such Convertible
Securities which were actually converted or exchanged, plus the additional consideration, if any,
actually received by the Company upon such conversion or exchange, and

(4) In case at any time any shares of
Common Stock or Convertible Securities or any rights or options to purchase any such Common
Stock, or Convertible Securities shall be issued or sold for cash, the consideration received
therefor shall be deemed to be the amount received by the Company therefor. In case any shares
of Common Stock or Convertible Securities or any rights or options to purchase any such
Common Stock or Convertible Securities shall be issued or sold for a consideration other than
cash, the amount of the consideration other than cash received by the Company shall be deemed
to be the fair value of such consideration as determined by the Board of Directors. In case any
shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities or any rights or options to purchase any such
Common Stock or Convertible Securities shall be issued in connection with any merger of
another corporation into the Company, the amount of consideration therefor shall be deemed to
be the fair value of the assets of such merged corporation as determined by the Board of
Directors after deducting therefrom all cash and other consideration (if any) paid by the
Company in connection with such merger.

(e) No Impairment. The Company will not, by amendment of
its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of
assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary
action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed
or performed hereunder by the Company, but will at all times in good faith assist in carrying out
of all the provision of this Section 3 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or

A-11
SV'589779.4
appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock against
impairment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 3(e) shall prohibit the
Company from amending its certificate of incorporation with the requisite consent of the
stockholders and the Board of Directors.

(f) Certificate of Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each
adjustment or readjustment of the applicable Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 3, the
Company at its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance
with the terms hereof and furnish to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such
adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or
readjustment is based. The Company shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of
Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (i)
such adjustments or readjustments made to the Preferred Stock, (11) the applicable Conversion
Price at the time in effect, and (iii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if
any, of other property which at the time would be received upon the conversion of Preferred
Stock.

(g) Notices of Record Date. In the event that the Company
shall propose at any time (i) to declare any dividend; (11) to offer for subscription to the holders
of any class or series of its stock any additional shares of stock or other rights; or (iii) to effect
any reclassification or recapitalization; then, in connection with each such event, the Company
shall send to the holders of the Preferred Stock at least 15 days’ prior written notice of the date
on which a record shall be taken for such dividend, or subscription rights (and specifying the
date on which the holders of stock shall be entitled thereto) or for determining rights to vote in
respect of reclassification or recapitalization.

(h) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The
Company shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of

Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred
Stock, such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to
effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the
number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, the Company will take such
corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but
unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such
purpose.

4, Voting.

Series A-3 Preferred Stock, Series A-2 Preferred Stock and Series A-1 Preferred Stock,
respectively, held by such holder of Preferred Stock could then be converted. The holders of
shares of the Series A-3 Preferred Stock, Series A-2 Preferred Stock and Series A-1 Preferred
Stock shall be entitled to vote on all matters on which the Common Stock shall be entitled to
vote. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to notice of any stockholders’ meeting

permitted and any fractional voting rights resulting from the above formula (after aggregating all
shares into which shares of Series A-3 Preferred Stock, Series A-2 Preferred Stock and Series
A-| Preferred Stock, respectively, held by each holder could be converted), shall be disregarded.
Holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to vote.

(c) Common Stock. Each holder of shares of Common Stock
shall be entitled to one vote for each share thereof held. The number of authorized shares of
Common Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then

entitled to vote, irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the General Corporation
Law of Delaware.

Preferred Stock, voting separately as a single class, shall be entitled to elect four (4) directors.
The holders of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, voting separately as a single class, shall be
entitled to elect three (3) directors. All other members of the Board of Directors shall be elected

Series A-2 Preferred Stock and Series A-1 Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class.
Any vacancies on the Board of Directors shall be filled by vote of the holders of the class or
series that elected the director whose absence created such vacancy. There shall be no
cumulative voting. except to the extent the Company is subject to Section 2115 of the California
General Corporation Law, and such section is deemed to make Section 708(a), (b) and (c) of the
California General Corporation Law applicable to the Company, in which case the stockholders
of the Company shall have the right to cumulate votes in connection with the election of
directors as provided by Section 708(a), (b) and (c) of the California General Corporation Law.
