WEST\24 1970376.6 -8-
AQ746256

Common Stock basis, or (ii) immediately upon the closing of the sale of the Corporation’s
Common Stock in a firm commitment, underwritten public offering registered under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) (other than a registration relating
solely to a transaction under Rule 145 under such Securities Act (or any successor thereto) or
to an employee benefit plan of the Corporation) with gross proceeds to the Corporation (before

for any Stock Reclassification) and (y) an amount equal to all declared but unpaid dividends on
shares of Series C Preferred Stock (a “Qualified IPO”).

(c) Mechanics of Conversion.

(i) Before any holder of Preferred Stock shal! be entitled
voluntarily to convert the same into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the
certificate or certificates therefor (or evidence satisfactory to the Corporation as to the loss of
such certificate or certificates), duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any
transfer agent for such stock, and shall give written notice to the Corporation at such office that
such holder elects to convert the same (except that no such written notice of election to convert
shall be necessary in the event of an automatic conversion pursuant to Section C.4(b) hereof)
and shall state therein the number of shares of Preferred Stock to be converted and the name or
names in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock
to be issued. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such
office to such holder of Preferred Stock a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of
Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled. Such conversion shall be deemed to
have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of surrender of the
shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the
record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date.

650) If the conversion is in connection with an underwritten
offering of securities pursuant to the Securities Act (including a Qualified IPO), the conversion
may, at the option of any holder tendering shares of Preferred Stock for conversion, be
conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to such
offering, in which event the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock upon conversion
of the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until
immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities. If the conversion occurs through the
vote of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding as set
forth in Section C.4(b)¢(i) hereof, such conversion shall be deemed to have been made at the
close of business on the day written notice of such election has been received by the
Corporation or such later date as set forth in such written notice, and the person or persons
entitled to receive shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for
all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date.
Until certificates for such shares of Preferred Stock which have been converted have been
delivered to the Corporation for exchange for certificates representing such Common Stock,
such certificates shall be deemed to represent the shares of Common Stock into which such
Preferred Stock has been converted.

(8) shares of Common Stock or other
securities issued or issuable pursuant to the acquisition of another corporation or entity
pursuant to a consolidation, merger, purchase of all or substantially all of the assets of such
entity or other reorganization (other than a mere reincorporation transaction for the sole
purpose of changiny the Corporation's domicile) in which the Corporation acquires, in a single
transaction or series of related transactions, al] or substantially all of the assets of such entity or
fifly percent (50%) or more of the equity ownership in such. entity and any securities
exercisable upon the exercise or conversion thereof; provided, that such transaction or series of
related transactions is approved by the Board of Directors;

(9) shares of Common Stock or other
securities issued or issuable in a transaction or a series of related transactions (i) that would
otherwise result in an adjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to Section C.4(d)(iv) below
and (il) that is approved by (x) the Board of Directors and (y) the holders of at least a majority
of each series of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock that would otherwise be
entitled to an adjustment of the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock in such
transaction or series of related transactions, with each such series voting as a separate class.

(ii) No Adjustment of Conversion Price. Any provision
herein to the contrary notwithstanding, no adjustment in the Conversion Price for a series of
Preferred Stock shall be made in respect of the issuance of Additional Shares of Common
Stock unless the consideration per share (determined pursuant to Section C.4(d)(v) hereof) for
an Additional Share of Common Stock issued or deemed to be issued by the Corporation is less
than the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock in effect on the date of, and
immediately prior to, such issue.

(iii) Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock.
In the event the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall
issue any Options or Convertible Securities or shall fix a record date for the determination of
holders of any class of securities then entitled to receive any such Options or Convertible
Securities, then the maximum number of shares (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto
without regard to any provisions contained therein designed to protect against dilution) of
Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case of Convertible
Securities and/or Options therefor, the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities,
shall be deemed to be Additional Shares of Common Stock issued as of the time of such issue
or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record

date; provided, that in any such case in which Additional Shares of Common Stock are deemed
to be issued:

(A) _ no further adjustments to the Conversion Price for
a series of Preferred Stock shall be made upon the subsequent issue of Options or Convertible
Securities or shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of such Options or conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities;

WES1\24 1970376.6 “ll.
A0746256

(B) if such Options or Convertible Securities by their
terms provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any increase or decrease in the
consideration payable to the Corporation, or decrease or increase in the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable, upon the exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, the Conversion
Price for a serics of Preferred Stock computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon the
occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based
thereon, shall, upon any such increase or decrease becoming effective, be recomputed to reflect
such increase or decrease insofar as it affects such Options or the rights of conversion or
exchange under such Convertible Securities (provided, however, that no such adjustment of the
Conversion Price for a series of Preferred Stock shall affect Common Stock previously issued
upon conversion of the shares of such series of Preferred Stock);

(C) upon the expiration of any such Options or any
rights of conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities that shal! not have been
exercised, the Conversion Price for a series of Preferred Stock computed upon the original
issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent
adjustments based thereon, shall, upon such expiration, be recomputed as if:

(1) in the case of Convertible Securities or
Options for Common Stock the only Additional Shares of Common Stock issued were the
shares of Common Stock, if any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities and the consideration received therefor
was the consideration actually received by the Corporation for the issue of all such Options,
whether or not exercised, plus the consideration actually received by the Corporation upon
such exercise, or for the issue of all such Convertible Securities which were actually converted
or exchanged, plus the additional consideration, if any, actually received by the Corporation
upon such conversion or exchange, and

(2) in the case of Options for Convertible
Securities only the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof
were issued al the time of issue of such Options, and the consideration received by the
Corporation for the Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been then issued was
the consideration actually received by the Corporation for the issue of all such Options,
whether or not exercised, plus the consideration deemed to have been received by the
Corporation (determined pursuant to Section C.4(d) hereof) upon the issue of the Convertible
Securilies with respect to which such Options were actually exercised;

(D) no readjustment pursuant to clause (B) or (C)
above shall have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price for a series of Preferred Stock to
an amount which exceeds the lower of (1) the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred
Stock on the original adjustment date or (2) the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred
Stock that would have resulted from any.issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock
between the original adjustment date and such readjustment date.

(E) _ in the case of any Options which expire by their

terms not more than thirty (30) days after the date of issue thereof, no adjustment of the
Conversion Price for a series of Preferred Stock shall be made until the expiration or exercise

WEST\24 1970376,6 -12-
A0746256

of all such Options, whereupon such adjustment shall be made in the same manner provided in
clause (C) above.

(iv) Adjustment_of Conversion Price Upon Issuance_of
Additional Shares of Common Stock. In the event this Corporation, at any time after the

Original Issue Date, shall issue Additional Shares of Common Stock (including Additional
Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to Section C.4(d)(iii) hereof) without
consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Conversion Price for a series of
Preferred Stock then in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such issue, then and in
such event, the applicable Conversion Price for each such series of Preferred Stock then in
effect shall be reduced, concurrently with such issuance, to a price determined by multiplying
the applicable Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of
shares of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for the
total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued would purchase at such
Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance, and the denominator of which
shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such
issuance plus the number of such Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued, For the
purpose of the above calculation, the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to such issuance shall be calculated as of the date of conversion on a fully-
diluted basis, as if all shares of Preferred Stock and all Convertible Securities had been fully
converted into shares of Common Stock immediately prior to such issuance and any
outstanding Options had been fully exercised immediatcly prior to such issuance (and the
resulting securities fully converted into shares of Common Stock, if so convertible), but not
including in such calculation any additional shares of Common Stock issuable with respect to
shares of Preferred Stock, Convertible Securities or outstanding Options, solely as a result of
the adjustment of the respective Conversion Price (or other conversion ratios) resulting from
the issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock causing such adjustment.

(v) Determination _of Consideration. For purposes of this
Section C.4(d), the consideration received by the Corporation for the issuance of any
Additional Shares of Common Stock shall be computed as follows:

(A) Cash and Property. Such consideration shall:

(i) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed
at the aggregate amount of cash received by the Corporation, excluding amounts paid or
payable for accrued interest or accrued dividends;

(2) __ insofar as it consists of property other than
cash, be computed at the fair value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors; and

(3) in the event Additional Shares of Common
Stock are issued together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for
consideration that covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed
as provided in clauses (1) and (2) above, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors,

WEST\24 1970376.6 -13-
A0746256

(B) Options and Convertible Securities, The
consideration per share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock

deemed to have been issued pursuant to Section C.4(d)(iii) hereof, relating to Options and
Convertible Securities, shall be determined by dividing:

(1) the total amount, if any, received or
receivable by the Corporation as consideration for the issuance of such Options or Convertible
Securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the
instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein designed to
protect against dilution) payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for
Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities and the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, by

(2) the maximum number of shares of
Common Stock (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision

contained thercin designed to protect against dilution) issuable upon the exercise of such
Options or conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities,

(e) Adjustments to Conversion Price for Stock Dividends and for
Combinations or Subdivisions of Common Stock. In the event that this Corporation at any
time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall declare or pay, without
consideration, any dividend on the Common Stock payable in Common Stock or in any right to
acquire Common Stock for no consideration, or shall effect a subdivision of the outstanding
shares of Cammon Stock into a greater number of shares of Common Stock (by stock split,
reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in Common Stock or in any right to
acquire Common Stock), or in the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be
combined or consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of
Common Stock, then the applicable Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock in
effect immediately prior to such event shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such event,
be proportionately decreased or increased, as appropriate. In the event that this Corporation —
shall declare or pay, without consideration, any dividend on the Common Stock payable in any
right to acquire Common Stock for no consideration, then the Corporation shall be deemed to
have made a dividend payable in Common Stock in an amount of shares equal to the maximum
number of shares issuable upon exercise of such rights to acquire Common Stock.

(f) Adjustments for Reclassification and Reorganization. Jf the
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same
or a different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock, whether by capital
reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares
provided for in Section C.4(e) hereof or a merger or other reorganization referred to in Section
C.2(e) hereof), the applicable Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock then in effect
shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such reorganization or reclassification, be
proportionately adjusted so that each such series of the Preferred Stock shall be convertible
into, in licu of the number of shares of Common Stock that the holders would otherwise have
been entitled to receive, a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock equivalent to

WEST\24 1970376.6 -14-
AQ746256

the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been subject to receipt by the holders
upon conversion of the Preferred Stock immediately before that change.

(g) Special Conversion For Failure to Purchase Shares of Series F
Preferred Stock Prior to October 30, 2013.

(i) Trigger Event. In the event that any holder of shares of
Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D

Preferred Stock or Series E Preferred Stock or any third party designated in writing by such
holder of Preferred stock to purchase such holders’ Pro Rata Amount (such third party to be
reasonably acceptable to the Corporation) (a “Third Party Designee”) does not, after receipt
of notice of an opportunity to do so, purchase on or before October 30, 2013, such holder’s Pro
Rata Amount, then each outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred
Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock and Series E Preferred Stock held by
such holder (not on an as-converted to Common Stock basis) shall automatically, and without
any further action on the part of such holder, be converted into 1/3 of one share of Common
Stock, rounded down to the nearest whole share after aggregation of all such conversions, on
October 31, 2013. For determining the number of shares of Series F Preferred Stock a holder
of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D
Preferred Stock or Series E Preferred Stock (or their respective Third Party Designee) has
purchased in the Series F Preferred Stock Financing, all shares of Series F Preferred Stock
purchased by an Affiliate or Third Party Designee of such holder shall be aggregated with the
Serics F Preferred Stock purchased by such holder (provided that no shares or securities shal]
be altributed to mare than one entity or person within any such group of affiliated entities or
persons). Such conversion is referred to as the “Special Mandatory Conversion.”

(ii) | Procedural Requirements. Upon a Special Mandatory
Conversion, each holder of shares of Preferred Stock converted pursuant to subsection (g){i)
shall be sent written notice of such Special Mandatory Conversion and the place designated for
mandatory conversion of all such shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section C.4(g).
Upon receipt of such notice, each holder of such shares of Preferred Stock shall surrender his,
her or its certificate or certificates for all such shares (or, if such holder alleges that such
certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement
reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that
may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of
such certificatc) to the Corporation at the place designated in such notice. If so required by the
Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by
written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly
executed by the registered holder or by his, her or its attorney duly authorized in writing. All
rights with respect to the Preferred Stock converted pursuant to subsection (g)(i), including the
rights, if any, to receive notices and vote (other than as a holder of Common Stock), will
terminate at the time of the Special Mandatory Conversion (notwithstanding the failure of the
holder or holders thereof to surrender the certificates for such shares at or prior to such time),
except only the rights of the holders thereof, upon surrender of their certificate or certificates
therefor (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement), to receive the items provided for in the
next sentence of this subsection (g)(ii), As soon as practicable after the Special Mandatory
Conversion and the surrender of the certificate or certificates (or lost certificate affidavit and

WEST\241970376.6 -15-
A0746256

agreement) for Preferred Stock so converted, the Corporation shall issue and deliver to such
holder. or to his, her or its nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of
Common Stock issuable on such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof, together
with cash as provided in Section C.4(m) in lieu of any fraction of a share of Common Stock
otherwise issuable upon such conversion and the payment of any declared but unpaid dividends
on the shares of Preferred Stock converted. Such converted Preferred Stock shall be retired
and cancelled and may not be reissued as shares of such series of Preferred Stock, and the
Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate action (without the need for stockholder

action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of such series of
Preferred Stock accordingly.

(iii) Definitions. For purposes of this Section C.4(g), the
following definitions shall apply:

(A) “Affiliate” shall mean, with respect to any holder of shares of Preferred Stock,

outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred
Stock, Series D Preferred Stock or Series E Preferred Stock owned by such holder, and (II) the

denominator of which ts 128,929,687, the product of which is rounded down to the nearest

(h) No Impairment. The Corporation wil! not, without first
obtaining the approval of the holders of at least a majority of the then-outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class and on an as-converted to Common Stock
basis), avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed
or performed hereunder by the Corporation including through any reorganization, transfer of
assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary

A0746256

adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or

series of Preferred Stock at the time in effect, and (iii) the number of shares of Common Stock

and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon the
conversion of such series of Preferred Stock.

(j) Notices of Record Date. In the event that the Corporation shall
propose at any time: (A) to declare any dividend or distribution upon its Common Stock,
whether in cash, property, stock or other securities, whether or not a regular cash dividend and

(k) Issue Taxes. The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and
other taxes that may be payable in respect of any issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock
upon conversion of Preferred Stock pursuant hereto; provided, however, that the Corporation
shall not be obligated to pay any transfer taxes resulting from any transfer requested by any
holder in connection with any such conversion,

(I) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion, |The
Corporation shal! at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued
shares of Cammon Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the
Preferred Stock. such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be
sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any
time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to

authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be
sufficient for such purpose, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the
requisite shareholder approval of any necessary amendment to the Articles of Incorporation.

(m) Fractional Shares. No fractional share shal! be issued upon the
conversion of any share or shares of Preferred Stock. Al! shares of Common Stock (including
fractions thercof) issuable upon conversion of more than one share of Preferred Stock by a
holder thereof shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the conversion would
result in the issuance of any fractional share. If, after the aforementioned aggregation, the
conversion would result in the issuance of a fraction of a share of Common Stock, the
Corporation shall, tn lieu of issuing any fractional share, pay the holder otherwise entitled to
such fraction a sum in cash equal to the fair market value of such fraction on the date of
conversion (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors).

the Corporation shall, within thirty (30) days after receipt by the Corporation of such
Redemption Vole, and concurrently with surrender by the holders of the certificates
representing the shares of Preferred Stock (or evidence acceptable to the Corporation as to the
loss of such certificates), to the extent it may lawfully do so, redeem all of the outstanding

shown on the records of the Corporation for such holder, notifying such holder of the
redemption to be effected, specifying the number of shares to be redeemed from such holder,
the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price, the place at which payment may be obtained and
calling upon such holder to surrender to the Corporation, in the manner and at the place

outstanding and entitled to all of the rights and preferences provided herein. At any time
thereafter when additional funds of the Corporation are legally available for the redemption of
shares of Preferred Stock, such funds will immediately be used to redcem, without interest, the

the respective holders of the shares designated for redemption and not yet redeemed, with
irrevocable instructions and authority to the bank or trust corporation to publish the notice of
redemption thereof and pay the Redemption Price for such shares to their respective holders on
or aticr the Redemption Date, upon receipt of notification from the Corporation that such
holder has surrendered his, her or its share certificate to the Corporation pursuant to subsection
6(b) above. As of the date of such deposit (even if prior to the Redemption Date), the deposit
shall constitute full payment of the shares to their holders, and from and after the date of the
deposit the shares so called for redemption shall be redeemed and shall be deemed to be no
longer outstanding, and the holders thereof shall cease to be shareholders with respect to such

monic¢s deposited by the Corporation pursuant to this subsection 6(d) remaining unclaimed at
the expiration of two (2) years following the Redemption Date shall thereafter be returned to

the Corporation upon its request expressed in a duly adopted resolution of its Board of
Directors.

7. No Reissuance of Preferred Stock. No share or shares of Preferred
Stock acquired by the Corporation by reason of redemption, purchase, conversion or otherwise
