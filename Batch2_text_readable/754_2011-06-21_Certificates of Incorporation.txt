B3881094.3

A description of the respective classes of stock and a statement of the designations,
preferences, voting powers, relative, participating, optional or other special rights and privileges
and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions of the Preferred Stock and Common Stock are
as follows:

A. Common Stock.

1. Relative Rights of Preferred Stock and Common Stock. All preferences, voting
powers, relative, participating, optional or other special rights and privileges, and qualifications,
limitations or restrictions, of the Common Stock are expressly made subject to and qualified by
those that may be fixed with respect to any shares of the Preferred Stock.

2. Voting Rights. Except as otherwise required by law or this Certificate of
Incorporation, the holders of Common Stock will be entitled to one vote per share on all matters
to be voted on by the stockholders of the Corporation.

3. Increase/Decrease of Common Stock. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section
242(b)(2) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “Delaware General
Corporation Law”), the number of authorized shares of Common Stock may be increased or
decreased (but not below the number of shares then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation, voting as a
single class, with each such share being entitled to such number of votes per share as is provided
in this Article FOURTH.

4, Dividends. Dividends may be paid on the Common Stock out of funds legally
available therefor if, as and when determined by the Board of Directors of the Corporation
subject to the restrictions of Section B.1 below.

5. Dissolution, Liquidation or Winding-Up. In the event of any dissolution,
liquidation or winding-up of the affairs of the Corporation, after distribution in full of the
preferential amounts, if any, to be distributed to the holders of shares of the Preferred Stock,
holders of Common Stock shall be entitled, unless otherwise provided by law or this Certificate
of Incorporation, to receive all of the remaining assets of the Corporation of whatever kind
available for distribution to stockholders ratably in proportion to the number of shares of
Common Stock held by them.

B. Preferred Stock.

1. Dividends. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, out of
funds legally available therefor, dividends at the same rate as dividends (other than dividends
paid in additional shares of Common Stock) are paid with respect to the Common Stock (treating
each share of Preferred Stock as being equal to the number of shares of Common Stock
(including fractions of a share) into which each share of Preferred Stock is then convertible).
Subject to the foregoing restrictions, dividends may be declared and paid on Preferred Stock

B3881094.3
from funds legally available therefor if, as and when, determined by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation.

2. Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding-Up: Certain Mergers, Consolidations and
Asset Sales.

(a) Payment Upon Liquidation.

(i) Preferred Stock. Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up
of the Corporation (a “Liquidation’”), whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of each
share of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive an amount, to be paid first out of the
assets of the Corporation available for distribution to holders of the capital stock of all
classes, equal to the greater of the following:

(1) the Original Issue Price (as defined below) of such share
(which amount shall be subject to equitable adjustment whenever there
shall occur a stock dividend, distribution, combination of shares,
reclassification or other similar event with respect to the Preferred Stock)
plus any declared and unpaid dividends thereon (the “Liquidation
Preference”), subject to the adjustment set forth below; or

(2) such amount as would have been payable in respect of such
share of Preferred Stock had it been converted to Common Stock
immediately prior to such Liquidation pursuant to the provisions of
Section 4.

If the assets of the Corporation shall be insufficient to permit the payment in full to the
holders of the Preferred Stock of all amounts distributable to them under the foregoing
sentence, then the entire assets of the Corporation available for such distribution shall be
distributed ratably among the holders of the Preferred Stock on a pari passu basis in
proportion to the full preferential amount each such holder is otherwise entitled to receive.
The “Original Issue Price” of each share of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred
Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock is $1.23786, $1.82055,
$1.47042 and $1.95127, respectively.

(ii) Common Stock. After such payments shall have been made in full
to the holders of the Preferred Stock or funds necessary for such payments shall have been
set aside by the Corporation in trust for the account of holders of Preferred Stock so as to be
available for such payments, the remaining assets available for distribution shall be
distributed among the holders of the Common Stock ratably in proportion to the number of
shares of Common Stock held by them.

Upon conversion of shares of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock pursuant
to Section 4 below, the holder of such Common Stock shall not be entitled to any preferential
payment or distribution in case of any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the
Corporation, but shall share ratably in any distribution of the assets of the Corporation to all
the holders of Common Stock.

B3881094.3
(b) Distributions Other than Cash. Whenever the distribution provided for in
this Section 2 shall be payable in property other than cash, the value of such distribution shall be
the fair market value of such property as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of
the Corporation.

(c) Merger as Liquidation, etc. The holders of the Preferred Stock at the time
of (i) a consolidation or merger of the Corporation into or with any other entity or entities that
results in the exchange of outstanding shares of the Corporation for securities or other
consideration issued or paid or caused to be issued or paid by any such entity or affiliate thereof
(except a consolidation or merger into a wholly owned subsidiary or merger in which the
Corporation is the surviving Corporation and, in either case, the holders of the Corporation’s
voting stock outstanding immediately prior to the transaction hold a majority in voting power of
the voting stock of the resulting corporation outstanding immediately following the transaction),
(ii) the sale or transfer by the Corporation of all or substantially all its assets, (iii) the sale or
transfer by the Corporation’s stockholders of capital stock representing a majority of the voting
power at elections of directors of the Corporation, or (iv) the grant of an exclusive license of all
or substantially all of the Corporation’s intellectual property in a transaction that has an effect
substantially similar to a sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the Corporation’s assets
(each, an “Event”), may deem such Event to be a liquidation within the meaning of the
provisions of this Section 2 by a vote of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Preferred
Stock (voting as a single class on an as-converted basis) and by giving written notice thereof to
the Corporation at least seven days before the effective date of the Event (a “Deemed
Liquidation”). The amount deemed distributed to the holders of Preferred Stock upon any such
Event shall be the cash or the value of the property, rights or securities distributed to such
holders by the acquiring person, firm or other entity. The value of such property, rights or other
securities shall be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

(d) Notice and ortunity to Exercise Conversion Rights. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary that may be inferred from the provisions of this Section 2, each holder of
shares of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive notice from the Corporation pursuant to
Section 4(k) hereof of any proposed Event or liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the
Corporation at least ten (10) days prior to the date on which any such liquidation, dissolution or
winding-up of the Corporation is scheduled to occur and, at any time prior to any such
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation, to convert any or all of such holder’s
shares of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 4 hereof.

3, Voting

(a) Each holder of outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to the
number of votes equal to the number of whole shares of Common Stock into which the shares of
Preferred Stock held by such holder are then convertible (as adjusted from time to time pursuant
to Section 4 hereof), at each meeting of stockholders of the Corporation (and written actions of
stockholders in lieu of meetings) with respect to any and all matters presented to the stockholders
of the Corporation for their action or consideration. Except as provided by law, by the
provisions of Section 3(b) below or by the provisions establishing any other series of Preferred
Stock, holders of Preferred Stock shall vote together with the holders of Common Stock as a
single class on all actions to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation, including, but not

4
B3881094.3
limited to actions amending the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation to increase the
number of authorized shares of Common Stock.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and notwithstanding the
provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the number of
authorized shares of Common Stock may be increased by the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of Preferred Stock and Common Stock, voting as one class and each holder of Preferred
Stock having that number of votes per share as is equal to the number of shares of Common
Stock into which each such share of Preferred Stock held by such holder could be converted on
the date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote on such increase or decrease. Except
as expressly set forth herein, with respect to all questions as to which, under law, stockholders
are entitled to vote by classes, the Preferred Stock and the Common Stock shall vote separately
as single classes.

(c)  Atall times during which shares of Preferred Stock remain outstanding,
the holders of a majority of such outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall have the exclusive
right, voting separately from the Common Stock, to elect one director of the Corporation (such
director being referred to herein as the “Preferred Director”), the designation of such Preferred
Director to be governed by any voting agreement or similar arrangement to which the holders of
Preferred Stock may from time to time be party. The Preferred Director may be removed,
without cause, and a replacement Preferred Director may be elected in his or her stead, at any
time only by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock. The holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall
have the exclusive right, voting separately from the Preferred Stock, to elect one director of the
Corporation (such director being referred to herein as the “Common Director’). The Common
Director may be removed, without cause, and a replacement Common Director may be elected in
his or her stead, at any time only by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock. The holders of record of the shares of Common Stock and
Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class, shall be entitled to elect the balance of the total
number of directors of the Corporation.

(d) Notwithstanding any provision of the By-laws of the Corporation to the
contrary, the number of directors (including the Preferred Director and the Common Director)
constituting the entire Board of Directors of the Corporation shall initially be fixed at five and
may only be increased upon (i) the approval of the Preferred Stock Director and the Common
Stock Director and (ii) the affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of a majority in
voting power of the outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, voting or consenting, each as the
case may be, as a single class or in accordance with the terms of any voting agreement or similar
arrangement to which the holders of the Preferred Stock may from time to time be party.

(e) In addition to any other rights provided by law, for so long as any shares
of Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the Corporation shall not (by amendment, merger,
consolidation or otherwise), without first obtaining the affirmative vote or written consent of the
holders of a majority in voting power of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock voting
together as a single class:

B3881094.3
(i) amend or repeal any provision of, or add any provision to, the
Corporation’s Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws;

(ii) | amend the preferences, rights or privileges of the Preferred Stock;

(iii) authorize or designate, or issue any shares of, any class or series of
capital stock having rights senior to or on a parity with the Preferred Stock as to
dividends, liquidation or otherwise;

(iv) effect any change of control, liquidation, merger, reincorporation,
or recapitalization, or sale or other transfer of all or substantially all of the Corporation’s
assets;

(v) effect any acquisition of the capital stock of another entity (other
than the creation of wholly owned subsidiaries) that results in the consolidation of that
entity into the results of operations of the Corporation or effect any acquisition of all or
substantially all of the assets of another entity (other than wholly owned subsidiaries);

(vi) incur indebtedness for borrowed money, in a single transaction or
series of related transactions, in an amount in excess of $500,000, excluding indebtedness
existing under that certain Secured Promissory Note between adidas Sales, Inc and the
Corporation dated November 12, 2008;

(vii) create a new plan or arrangement for the grant of stock options,
stock appreciation rights, restricted stock or other similar stock-based compensation or
increase the number of shares or other rights available under any existing plan or
atrangement unless the number of shares or other rights available under all new and
existing plans and arrangements will not exceed the number of shares not deemed to be
Additional Shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 4(d)(i)(D)(IV);

(viii) pay or declare any dividend or distribution on any shares of the
Corporation’s capital stock (except dividends payable solely in shares of Common
Stock), or apply any of the Corporation’s assets to the redemption or repurchase of the
Corporation’s capital stock; or

(ix) increase the authorized number of directors constituting the whole
Board of Directors.

4. Optional Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion
rights as follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at
the option of the holder thereof, at any time and from time to time, and without the payment of
additional consideration by the holder thereof, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable
shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Original Issue Price of such share by
the Conversion Price (as defined below) of such share in effect at the time of conversion. The
Conversion Price of each share of Preferred Stock shall initially be its Original Issue Price (the
“Conversion Price”). Such initial Conversion Price, and the rate at which shares of Preferred

6
B3881094.3
Stock may be converted into shares of Common Stock, shall be subject to adjustment as provided
below. In the event of a notice of redemption of any shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to
Section 6 hereof, the Conversion Rights of the shares designated for redemption shall terminate
at the close of business on the first full day preceding the date fixed for redemption, unless the
redemption price is not paid on such redemption date, in which case the Conversion Rights for
such shares shall continue until such price is paid in full.

(b) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued
upon conversion of the Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder
would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by
the fair market value of a share of Common Stock as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors of the Corporation. Whether or not fractional shares would be issuable upon such
conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock the
holder is at the time converting into Common Stock and the aggregate number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion.

(i) In order for a holder of Preferred Stock to convert shares of
Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the certificate
or certificates for such shares of Preferred Stock, at the office of the transfer agent for the
Preferred Stock (or at the principal office of the Corporation if the Corporation serves as
its own transfer agent), together with written notice that such holder elects to convert all
or any number of the shares of Preferred Stock represented by such certificate or
certificates. Such notice shall state such holder’s name or the names of the nominees in
which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be
issued. If required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be
endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form
satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or his or its
attorney duly authorized in writing. The date of receipt of such certificates and notice by
the transfer agent (or by the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer
agent) shall be the conversion date (“Conversion Date”), and the shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of the shares represented by such certificate shall be
deemed to be outstanding of record as of such date. The Corporation shall, as soon as
practicable after the Conversion Date, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of
Preferred Stock, or to his or its nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of
shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled, together with cash in lieu
of any fraction of a share.

(ii) | The Corporation shall at all times when any Preferred Stock shall
be outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued stock, for the
purpose of effecting the conversion of the Preferred Stock, such number of its duly
authorized shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding Preferred Stock. Before taking any action which would
cause an adjustment reducing the Conversion Price below the then par value of the shares
of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation will
take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order

B3881094.3
that the Corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion Price.

(iii)) Upon any such conversion, no adjustment to the Conversion Price
shall be made for any declared but unpaid dividends on the Preferred Stock surrendered
for conversion or on the Common Stock delivered upon conversion.

(iv) All shares of Preferred Stock which shall have been surrendered
for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all
rights with respect to such shares, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and to
vote, shall immediately cease and terminate on the Conversion Date, except only the right
of the holders thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor and
payment of any dividends declared but unpaid thereon. Any shares of Preferred Stock so
converted shall be retired and cancelled and shall not be reissued, and the Corporation
(without the need for stockholder action) may from time to time take such appropriate
action as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Preferred Stock
accordingly.

(v) | The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and other taxes that
may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon
conversion of shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4. The Corporation shall
not, however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer
involved in the issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than
that in which the shares of Preferred Stock so converted were registered, and no such
issuance or delivery shall be made unless and until the person or entity requesting such
issuance has paid to the Corporation the amount of any such tax or has established, to the
satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax has been paid.

(d) Adjustments to Conversion Price for Diluting Issues:

(i) Special Definitions. For purposes of this Section 4, the following
definitions shall apply:

(A) “Option” shall mean rights, options or warrants to
subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire Common Stock or Convertible
Securities.

(B) “Original Issue Date” of each series of Preferred Stock
shall mean the date on which the first share of such series of Preferred Stock was
issued.

(C) “Convertible Securities” shall mean any evidences of
indebtedness, shares or other securities directly or indirectly convertible into or
exchangeable for Common Stock, but excluding Options.

(D) “Additional Shares of Common Stock” shall mean all
shares of Common Stock issued (or, pursuant to Subsection 4(d)(iii) below,
deemed to be issued) by the Corporation after the date hereof other than:

8
B3881094.3
(1) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable upon
conversion of shares of Preferred Stock;

(11) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable as a
dividend or distribution on Preferred Stock;

(III) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable by
reason of a dividend, stock split, split-up or other
distribution on shares of Common Stock that is
covered by Section 4(e) or 4(f} below;

(IV) up to an aggregate 13,992,322 shares of Common
Stock (or Options or stock appreciation rights with
respect thereto) (appropriately adjusted to take
account of any stock split, stock dividend,
combination of shares or similar events with respect
to such shares of Common Stock), issued or
issuable to employees or directors of, or consultants
to, the Corporation pursuant to a plan or
arrangement approved by the Board of Directors of
the Corporation, or

(V) shares of Common Stock (including Options or
Convertible Securities) (a) issued solely in
consideration for the acquisition (whether by
merger or otherwise) by the Corporation of all or
substantially all of the capital stock or assets of any
other corporation or entity, (b) issued in connection
with an equipment financing, line of credit or other
lending arrangement, or (c) issued in connection
with a strategic partnering or joint venture
relationship.

(ii) | No Adjustment of Conversion Price. No adjustment in the number
of shares of Common Stock into which a series of Preferred Stock is convertible shall be
made, by adjustment in the Conversion Price of such series: (a) unless the consideration
per share (determined pursuant to Section 4(d)(v)) for an Additional Share of Common
Stock issued or deemed to be issued by the Corporation is less than the Conversion Price
in effect immediately prior to the issue of such Additional Shares of Common Stock, or
(b) if prior to, or after, such issuance, the Corporation receives written notice from the
holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of such series of Preferred Stock
agreeing that no such adjustment shall be made as the result of the issuance of Additional
Shares of Common Stock.

(iii) Issue of Securities Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common
Stock. If the Corporation at any time or from time to time hereafter shall issue any
Options or Convertible Securities (excluding Options or Convertible Securities or shares

B3881094.3
covered by Sections 4(d)(i)(D)(IV) and 4(d)(i)(D)(V) above) or shall fix a record date for
the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive any such Options
or Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set
forth in the instrument relating thereto without regard to any provision contained therein
for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options
or, in the case of Convertible Securities and Options therefor, the conversion or exchange
of such Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to be Additional Shares of Common
Stock issued as of the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shall have been
fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, provided that Additional Shares of
Common Stock shall not be deemed to have been issued unless the consideration per
share (determined pursuant to Section 4(d)(v) hereof) of such Additional Shares of
Common Stock would be less than the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock
in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such issue, or such record date, as the
case may be, and provided further that in any such case in which Additional Shares of
Common Stock are deemed to be issued:

(A) No further adjustment in any such Conversion Price shall
be made upon the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities or shares of
Common Stock upon the exercise of such Options or conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities;

(B) Ifsuch Options or Convertible Securities by their terms
provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any increase or
decrease in the consideration payable to the Corporation, then upon the
exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, each Conversion Price
computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a
record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based
thereon, shall, upon any such increase or decrease becoming effective, be
recomputed to reflect such increase or decrease insofar as it affects such
Options or the rights of conversion or exchange under such Convertible
Securities;

(C) Upon the expiration or termination of any Option or any
right to convert or exchange any Convertible Securities as to which an
adjustment in a Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4(d)(iv) has
previously been made upon the grant or issuance thereof, such Conversion
Price then in effect hereunder shall forthwith be increased to the
Conversion Price which would have been in effect at the time of such
expiration or termination had such Option or Convertible Securities, to the
extent outstanding immediately prior to such expiration or termination,
never been issued;

(D) In the event of any change in the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any
such Option or Convertible Security, including, but not limited to, a
change resulting from the anti-dilution provisions thereof, each
Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such change shall

10
B3881094.3
forthwith be readjusted to such Conversion Price as would have obtained
had such change been effected at the time of the issuance of such Option
or Convertible Security; and

(E) No readjustment pursuant to clause (B), (C) or (D) above
shall have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price of any series of
Preferred Stock to an amount which exceeds the lower of (i) the
Conversion Price of such series on the original adjustment date, or (ii) the
Conversion Price of such series that would have resulted from any
issuances of Additional Shares of Common Stock between the original
adjustment date and such readjustment date.

In the event the Corporation amends the terms of any such Options or Convertible
Securities so as to change the number of securities for which they are exercisable, convertible or
exchangeable or the consideration payable thereunder, then such Options or Convertible
Securities, as so amended, shall be deemed to have been issued at the time of such amendment
and the provisions of this Subsection 4(d)(ii) shall apply.

(iv) Adjustment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional
Shares of Common Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the

Original Issue Date of a series of Preferred Stock issue Additional Shares of Common
Stock (including Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to
Section 4(d)(iii)), without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the
Conversion Price of such series in effect immediately prior to such issue, then and in such
event, such Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to the lowest
price per share at which any such Additional Share of Common Stock is issued (or
deemed to be issued pursuant to Section 4(d)(iii)).

{v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this Section 4(d),
the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional Shares of
Common Stock shall be computed as follows:

(A) Cash and Property: Such consideration shall:

(1) _ insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
aggregate of cash received by the Corporation,
excluding amounts paid or payable for accrued
interest;

(II) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair market value thereof at the
time of such issue, as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors; and

(111) in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock
are issued together with other shares or securities or
other assets of the Corporation for consideration
which covers both, be the proportion of such

11
B3881094.3
consideration so received, computed as provided in
clauses (I) and (I) above, as determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors.

(B) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per

share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock
deemed to have been issued pursuant to Section 4(d)(iii), relating to
Options and Convertible Securities, shall be determined by dividing

(x) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the
Corporation as consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible
Securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional
consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without
regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of
such consideration) payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such
Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, or
in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such
Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities, by

(y) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set
forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision
contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable
upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities.

(vi) Multiple Closing Dates. In the event the Corporation shall issue on
more than one date Additional Shares of Common Stock which are comprised of shares
of the same series or class of Preferred Stock, and such issuance dates occur within a
period of no more than 120 days, then, upon the final such issuance, each Conversion
Price shall be adjusted to give effect to all such issuances as if they occurred on the date
of the final such issuance (and without giving effect to any adjustments as a result of such
prior issuances within such period).

(e) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If the Corporation shall at
any time or from time to time after the date hereof effect a subdivision of the outstanding
Common Stock, each Conversion Price then in effect immediately before that subdivision shall
be proportionately decreased. If the Corporation shall at any time or from time to time after the
date hereof combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock, each Conversion Price then in
effect immediately before the combination shall be proportionately increased. Any adjustment
under this paragraph shall become effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or
combination becomes effective.

(f) Adjustment for Certain Dividends and Distributions. In the event the
Corporation at any time, or from time to time after the date hereof shall make or issue, or fix a
record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or
other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock, then and in each such event

12
B3881094.3
each Conversion Price then in effect immediately before such event shall be decreased as of the
time of such issuance or, in the event such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of
business on such record date, by multiplying such Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction:

(1) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close
of business on such record date, and

(2) the denominator of which shail be the total number of shares of Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close
of business on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in
payment of such dividend or distribution;

provided, however, if such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend is not fully paid
or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, such Conversion Price shall be
recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record date and thereafter such
Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this paragraph as of the time of actual payment of
such dividends or distributions; and provided further, however, that no such adjustment shall be
made if the holders of the applicable series of Preferred Stock simultaneously receive (i) a
dividend or other distribution of shares of Common Stock in a number equal to the number of
shares of Common Stock as they would have received if all outstanding shares of such series of
Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event or (ti) a
dividend or other distribution of shares of such series of Preferred Stock which are convertible,
as of the date of such event, into such number of shares of Common Stock as is equal to the
number of additional shares of Common Stock being issued with respect to each share of
Common Stock in such dividend or distribution.

(g) Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date of a series of Preferred
Stock shall make or issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock
entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the Corporation (other
than shares of Common Stock) or in cash or other property (other than cash out of earnings or
earned surplus, determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles), then
and in each such event provision shall be made so that the holders of such Preferred Stock shall
receive upon conversion thereof in addition to the number of shares of Common Stock receivable
thereupon, the amount of securities of the Corporation that they would have received had such
Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event and had they
thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to and including the conversion date,
retained such securities receivable by them as aforesaid during such period, giving application to
all adjustments called for during such period under this paragraph with respect to the rights of the
holders of such Preferred Stock; and provided further, however, that no such adjustment shall be
made if the holders of such Preferred Stock simultaneously receive a dividend or other
distribution of such securities in an amount equal to the amount of such securities as they would
have received if all outstanding shares of such Preferred Stock had been converted into Common
Stock on the date of such event.

B3881094.3
(h) Adjustment for Merger or Reorganization, etc. Subject to the provisions
of Section 2(c), if there shall occur any reorganization, recapitalization, consolidation or merger

involving the Corporation in which the Common Stock is converted into or exchanged for
securities, cash or other property (other than a transaction covered by paragraphs (€), (f) or (g) of
this Section 4 or a transaction covered by Section 2 hereof), then, following any such
reorganization, recapitalization, consolidation or merger, each share of Preferred Stock shall be
convertible into the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property which a holder of the
number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation issuable upon conversion of such share
of Preferred Stock immediately prior to such reorganization, recapitalization, consolidation or
merger would have been entitled to receive pursuant to such transaction; and, in such case,
appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) shall be made in
the application of the provisions in this Section 4 set forth with respect to the rights and interest
thereafter of the holders of Preferred Stock, to the end that the provisions set forth in this

Section 4 (including provisions with respect to changes in and other adjustments of the
Conversion Price) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to
any shares of stock or other property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of such Preferred
Stock.

(i) No Impairment. The Corporation will not, other than by amendment of its
Certificate of Incorporation as permitted by law, through any reorganization, transfer of assets,
consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid
or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed
hereunder by the Corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all
the provisions of this Section 4 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or
appropriate in order to protect the Conversion Rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock
against impairment.

Gj) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of a Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation at its expense
shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and
furnish to each holder of any applicable series of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such
adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or
readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder
of any series of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a certificate
setting forth (i) the Conversion Price of such series then in effect, and (ii) the number of shares
of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other securities, cash or property which then would
be received upon the conversion of such series of Preferred Stock.

(k) Notice of Record Date. In the event:

(i) the Corporation shall take a record of the holders of its Common
Stock (or other stock or securities at the time issuable upon conversion of the Preferred
Stock) for the purpose of entitling or enabling them to receive any dividend or other
distribution, or to receive any right to subscribe for a purchase any shares of stock of any
class or any other securities, or to receive any other right; or

B3881094.3
(ii) of any capital reorganization of the Corporation, any
reclassification of the Common Stock of the Corporation, any consolidation or merger of
the Corporation with or into another corporation (other than a consolidation or merger in
which the Corporation is the surviving entity and its Common Stock is not converted into
or exchanged for any other securities or property), or any transfer of all or substantially
all of the assets of the Corporation; or

(iii) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-
up of the Corporation,

then, and in each such case, the Corporation will mail or cause to be mailed to the holders of the
Preferred Stock a notice specifying, as the case may be, (i) the record date for such dividend,
distribution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right, or (ii)
the effective date on which such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer,
dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is to take place, and the time, if any is to be fixed, as of
which the holders of record of Common Stock (or such other stock or securities at the time
issuable upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of
Common Stock (or such other stock or securities) for securities or other property deliverable
upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer, dissolution,
liquidation or winding-up. Such notice shall be mailed at least 10 days prior to the record date or
effective date for the event specified in such notice.

5. Mandatory Conversion.

(a) Upon the closing of the sale of shares of Common Stock in an
underwritten firm commitment public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, in which the price to the public per share is at least
$4.41126 (which amount shall be subject to equitable adjustment whenever there shall occur a
stock dividend, distribution, combination of shares, reclassification or other similar event with
respect to the Common Stock) (the “IPO Mandatory Conversion Date”), (y) each outstanding
share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the
then-effective conversion rate applicable to such share calculated in accordance with rules set
forth in Section 4, and (z) all provisions included under the caption “Preferred Stock”, and all
references to the Preferred Stock, shall be deleted and shall be of no further force or effect.

(b) Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into shares
of Common Stock at the then-effective conversion rate applicable to such share upon the election
of holders of a majority in voting power of shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding. Such
conversion shall be deemed to have occurred on the date (the “Special Conversion Date”;
collectively with the IPO Mandatory Conversion Date, “Mandatory Conversion Dates”) upon
which the aggregate number of shares of Preferred Stock which have been converted to Common
Stock exceeds such majority.

(c) All holders of record of shares of Preferred Stock shall be given written
notice of the relevant Mandatory Conversion Date and the place designated for mandatory
conversion of all such Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 5. Such notice need not be given
in advance of the occurrence of the Mandatory Conversion Date. Such notice shall be sent by

15
B3881094.3
first class or registered mail, postage prepaid, to each record holder of Preferred Stock at such
holder’s address last shown on the records of the transfer agent for the Preferred Stock (or the
records of the Corporation, if it serves as its own transfer agent). Upon receipt of such notice,
each holder of shares of Preferred Stock shall surrender his or its certificate or certificates for all
such shares to the Corporation at the place designated in such notice, and shall thereafter receive
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to this Section 5. On the Mandatory Conversion Date, all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock
shall be deemed to have been converted into shares of Common Stock, which shall be deemed to
be outstanding of record, and all rights with respect to the Preferred Stock so converted,
including the rights, if any, to receive notices and vote (other than as a holder of Common Stock)
will terminate, except only the rights of the holders thereof, upon surrender of their certificate or
certificates therefor, to receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which
such Preferred Stock has been converted, and payment of any declared but unpaid dividends
thereon. If so required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be
endorsed or accompanied by written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to
the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or by his or its attorney duly authorized
in writing. As soon as practicable after the Mandatory Conversion Date and the surrender of the
certificate or certificates for such Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall cause to be issued and
delivered to such holder, or on his or its written order, a certificate or certificates for the number
‘of full shares of Common Stock issuable on such conversion in accordance with the provisions
hereof and cash as provided in Section 4(b) in respect of any fraction of a share of Common
Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion.

(d) All certificates evidencing shares of Preferred Stock which are required to
be surrendered for conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof shall, from and after the
Mandatory Conversion Date, be deemed to have been retired and cancelled and the shares of
Preferred Stock represented thereby converted into Common Stock for all purposes,
notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender such certificates on or
prior to such date. Such converted Preferred Stock may not be reissued, and the Corporation
may thereafter take such appropriate action (without the need for stockholder action) as may be
necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Preferred Stock accordingly.

6. Redemption.

(a) At the written election of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock made at any time on or after 90 days prior to the tenth anniversary of the
Original Issue Date of the Series A Preferred Stock (the “Redemption Election”), the
Corporation shall be required to redeem all, but not less than all, of the outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock in two equal installments at a redemption price per share equal to such share’s
Original Issue Price (which amount shall be subject to equitable adjustment whenever there shall
occur a stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares, reclassification or similar event with
respect to the Preferred Stock), plus any declared but unpaid dividends on such share, upon the
terms set forth in this Section 6. In the Redemption Election the holders shall specify a date,
which shall be not less than 90 days after the date of the Redemption Election (the “Initial
Redemption Date”), on which the first such redemption installment shall occur, and the
Corporation shall redeem one-half of the outstanding shares of each series of Preferred Stock
held by each holder on the Initial Redemption Date and the remaining outstanding shares of

16
B3881094.3
Preferred Stock held by each holder on the first anniversary of the Initial Redemption Date. On
each such redemption date, the holders shall surrender the certificate or certificates for the shares
to be redeemed duly endorsed for transfer or with duly executed stock transfer powers sufficient
to permit transfer attached, at the offices of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for the
Preferred Stock. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver to
each holder a certificate or certificates for the balance of the shares not being redeemed.

(b) Notice of redemption shall be sent by first class mail, postage prepaid, to
each holder of record of the Preferred Stock, not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior to
the Initial Redemption Date, at the address of such holder as it appears on the books of the
Corporation. Such notice shall set forth (i) the Initial Redemption Date, the date of the second
installment of such redemption, and the place of redemption; and (ii) the number of shares to be
redeemed on each date of redemption and the redemption price on each such date. The
Corporation shall be obligated to redeem the Preferred Stock on the dates and in the amounts set
forth in the notice; provided, however, that any holder of Preferred Stock who is not party to a
Redemption Election may convert any or all of the shares owned by such holder into Common
Stock in accordance with Section 4 at any time prior to the date of redemption of such shares.
The Corporation, if advised before the close of business on the relevant redemption date by
written notice from any holder of record of Preferred Stock to be redeemed, shall credit against
the number of shares of Preferred Stock required to be redeemed from such holder, and shall not
redeem, the number of shares of Preferred Stock which had been converted by such holder on or
before such date and which had not previously been credited against any redemption.

(c) If, on or before a redemption date, the funds necessary for such
redemption shall have been set aside by the Corporation and deposited with a bank or trust
company, in trust for the pro rata benefit of the holders of the Preferred Stock that has been
called for redemption, then, notwithstanding that any certificates-for shares that have been called
for redemption shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, the shares represented thereby
shall no longer be deemed outstanding from and after such redemption date, and all rights of
holders of such shares so called for redemption shall forthwith, after such redemption date, cease
and terminate with respect to such shares, excepting only the right to receive the redemption
funds therefor to which they are entitled. Any interest accrued on funds so deposited and
unclaimed by stockholders entitled thereto shall be paid to such stockholders at the time their
respective shares are redeemed or to the Corporation at the time unclaimed amounts are paid to
it. In case the holders of Preferred Stock which shall have been called for redemption shall not,
within one year after the final redemption date, claim the amounts so deposited with respect to
the redemption thereof, any such bank or trust company shall, upon demand, pay over to the
Corporation such unclaimed amounts and thereupon such bank or trust company shall be
relieved of all responsibility in respect thereof to such holder and such holder shall look only to
the Corporation for the payment thereof. Any funds so deposited with a bank or trust company
which shall not be required for such redemption by reason of the exercise subsequent to the date
of such deposit of the right of conversion of any shares or otherwise shall be returned to the
Corporation forthwith.

(d) If the Corporation for any reason fails to redeem any of the shares of
Preferred Stock in accordance with Section 6(a) on or prior to the redemption dates determined
in accordance with this Section 6, then, the Corporation shall become obligated to pay, in

17
B3881094.3
addition to the redemption price specified in Section 6(a), interest on the unpaid balance of such
price, which shall accrue at a rate of one percent (1%) per month until such price is paid in full.

(e) If the funds of the Corporation legally available for redemption of shares
of Preferred Stock on a redemption date are insufficient to redeem the total number of shares of
Preferred Stock submitted for redemption, those funds which are legally available will be used to
redeem the maximum possible number of whole shares ratably among the holders of such shares.
The shares of Preferred Stock not redeemed shail remain outstanding and entitled to all rights
and preferences provided herein. At any time thereafter when additional funds of the
Corporation are legally available for the redemption of such shares of Preferred Stock, such
funds will be used, at the end of the next succeeding fiscal quarter, to redeem the balance of such
shares, or such portion thereof for which funds are then legally available.
