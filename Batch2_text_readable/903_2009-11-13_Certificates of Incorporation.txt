Preferred Stock are collectively referred to hereinafter as the “Preferred Stock.”

B. Rights, Preferences and Restrictions of Preferred Stock. The rights,
preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to and imposed on the Preferred Stock are as set
forth below in this Article IV(B).

1. Dividend Provisions.

(a) The holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
receive dividends, out of any assets legally available therefor, prior and in preference to any
declaration or payment of any dividend (payable other than in Common Stock or other securities
and rights convertible into or entitling the holder thereof to receive, directly or indirectly,
additional shares of Common Stock of the Corporation) on the Series A Preferred Stock and the
Common Stock of the Corporation, at the rate of $0.115 per annum (pro-rated on an elapsed days
basis for periods of less than one year) for each share of Series B Preferred Stock (as adjusted for
any stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, subdivisions, recapitalizations or the like),
payable when, as, and if declared by the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the “Board”).
Such dividends shail not be cumulative. No dividends shall be declared or paid on any shares of
Series A Preferred Stock or Common Stock during any fiscal year of the Corporation until
dividends in the total amount of $0.115 per annum for each share of Series B Preferred Stock (as
adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, subdivisions, recapitalizations or the
like) shall have been paid during that fiscal year. The holders of the outstanding Series B
Preferred Stock can waive any dividend preference that such holders of Series B Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to receive under this subsection 1(a) upon the affirmative vote or written consent
of the holders of at least a sixty six and two thirds percent (6674%) of the shares of Series B
Preferred Stock then outstanding (voting together as a separate series and on an as-converted
basis).

(b) After paying in full the $0.115 per share dividend (as adjusted as set forth
in Section 1(a)) to the holders of Series B Preferred Stock as set forth in subsection l(a), the
holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive dividends, out of any
assets legally available therefor, prior and in preference to any declaration or payment of any
dividend (payable other than in Common Stock or other securities and rights convertible into or
entitling the holder thereof to receive, directly or indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock
of this corporation) on the Common Stock of this corporation, at the rate of $0.0984 per annum
(pro-rated on an elapsed days basis for periods of less than one year) for each share of Series A
Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, subdivisions,
recapitalizations or the like), payable when, as, and if declared by the Board. Such dividends
shall not be cumulative. The holders of the outstanding Preferred Stock can waive any dividend
preference that such holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive under this

USIDOCS 7337678v1
subsection 1(b) upon the affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of at least sixty-six
and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding (voting
together as a separate series and on an as-converted basis).

(c) After payment of the dividends set forth in subsection 1(a) and subsection
1(b), any additional dividends or distributions shall be distributed among all holders of Common
Stock and Preferred Stock in proportion to the number of shares of Common Stock that would be
held by each such holder if all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock were converted to Common
Stock at the then effective Conversion Rate (as defined below).

2. Liquidation Preference.

(a) In the event of any Liquidation Event (as defined below), either voluntary
or involuntary, the holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, prior and in
preference to any distribution of the proceeds of such Liquidation Event (the “Proceeds”) to the
holders of Series A Preferred Stock and Common Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, an
amount per share equal to the sum of the applicable Original Issue Price (as defined below) for
the Series B Preferred Stock, plus declared but unpaid dividends on such share. If, upon the
occurrence of such event, the Proceeds thus distributed among the holders of the Series B
Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full aforesaid
preferential amounts, then the entire Proceeds legally available for distribution shall be
distributed ratably among the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock in proportion to the full
preferential amount that each such holder is otherwise entitled to receive under this subsection
2(a). For purposes of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, “Original Issue
Price” of the Series B Preferred Stock shall mean $1.4423358163 per share of the Series B
Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, subdivisions,
recapitalizations or the like with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock).

(b) After the holders of Series B Preferred Stock have been paid the
preferential amount set forth in subsection 2(a), the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any distribution of the Proceeds to the holders of
Common Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount per share equal to the sum of the
applicable Original Issue Price (as defined below) for the Series A Preferred Stock, plus declared
but unpaid dividends on such share. If, upon the occurrence of such event, the Proceeds thus
distributed among the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit the
payment to such holders of the full aforesaid preferential amounts, then the Proceeds legally
available for distribution to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock after the payment of the
preferential amount set forth in subsection 2(a) shall be distributed ratably among the holders of
the Series A Preferred Stock in proportion to the full preferential amount that each such holder is
otherwise entitled to receive under this subsection 2(a). For purposes of this Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation, “Original Issue Price” of the Series A Preferred Stock
shall mean $1.23 per share of the Series A Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock
dividends, combinations, subdivisions, recapitalizations or the like with respect to the Series A
Preferred Stock).

(c) Upon the completion of the distributions required by subsection 2(a) and
subsection 2(b), the remaining Proceeds available for distribution to stockholders shal! be

USIDOCS 7337678v1
distributed among the holders of Preferred Stock and Common Stock pro rata based on the
number of shares of Common Stock held by each (assuming full conversion of all such Preferred
Stock at the Conversion Rate then in effect) until, with respect to each series of Preferred Stock,
such holders shall have received the applicable Participation Cap (as defined below); thereafter,
if Proceeds remain, the holders of the Common Stock of the Corporation shall receive all of the
remaining Proceeds pro rata based on the number of shares of Common Stock held by each such
holder. For purposes of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, “Participation
Cap” shall mean (i) $7.25 per share for the Series B Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any stock
splits, stock dividends, combinations, subdivisions, recapitalizations or the like with respect to
such series of Preferred Stock), which includes amounts paid pursuant to subsection (a) of this
Section 2, and (ii) $3.69 per share for the Series A Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any stock
splits, stock dividends, combinations, subdivisions, recapitalizations or the like with respect to
such series of Preferred Stock), which includes amounts paid pursuant to subsection (b) of this
Section 2.

(d) Notwithstanding the above, for purposes of determining the amount each
holder of shares of Preferred Stock is entitled to receive in connection with a Liquidation Event,
each such holder of shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have converted (regardless of
whether such holder actually converted) such holder’s shares of Preferred Stock into shares of
Common Stock immediately prior to such Liquidation Event if, as a result of an actual
conversion, such holder would receive, in the aggregate, an amount greater than the amount that
would be distributed to such holder if such holder did not convert such series of Preferred Stock
into shares of Common Stock. If any such holder shall be deemed to have converted shares of
Preferred Stock into Common Stock pursuant to this paragraph, then such holder shall not be
entitled to receive any distribution that would otherwise be made to holders of Preferred Stock
that have not converted (or have not been deemed to have converted) into shares of Common
Stock.

(e) (i) A “Liquidation Event” shall mean (A) the closing of the sale,
lease, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Corporation or of all
or substantially all the assets of any other Azuro Entity (as defined in Section 6 below)
constituting all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation (determined on a consolidated
basis with all of the Corporation’s direct and indirect subsidiaries) (in either case, a
“Liquidation Azuro Entity”), (B) the consummation of the merger or consolidation of a
Liquidation Azuro Entity with or into another entity (except a merger or consolidation in which
the holders of capital stock of such Liquidation Azuro Entity immediately prior to such merger
or consolidation continue to hold at least fifty percent (50%) of the voting power of the capital
stock of such Liquidation Azuro Entity or the surviving or acquiring entity), (C) whether in one
transaction or a series of related transactions, the closing of the transfer to which a Liquidation
Azuro Entity is a party (whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise) to, or the closing of a
tender offer by, a person or group of affiliated persons (other than an underwriter of a
Liquidation Azuro Entity’s securities), of the securities of a Liquidation Azuro Entity, if, after
such closing, such person or group of affiliated persons would hold fifty percent (50%) or more
of the outstanding voting stock of such Liquidation Azuro Entity, or (D) a liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of a Liquidation Azuro Entity; provided, however, that a transaction
shall not constitute a Liquidation Event if its sole purpose is to change the state of a Liquidation
Azuro Entity’s incorporation or to create a holding company that will be owned in substantially

4

USIDOCS 7337678v1
the same proportions by the persons who held such Liquidation Azuro Entity’s securities
immediately prior to such transaction. The treatment of any particular transaction or series of
related transactions as a Liquidation Event may be waived by the vote or written consent of the
holders of at least sixty six and two-thirds percent (66%%) of the outstanding Preferred Stock
(voting together as a single class and not as separate series, and on an as-converted basis).

(ii) In any Liquidation Event, if Proceeds received are other than cash,
the value will be deemed their fair market value. Any securities shall be valued as follows:

(A) Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar
restrictions on free marketability covered by (B) below:

(1) If traded on a Securities Exchange (as defined
below), the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such
exchange or system over the twenty (20) trading day period ending three (3) trading days prior to
the closing;

(2) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall
be deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the
twenty (20) trading day period ending three (3) trading days prior to the closing; and

(3) If there is no active public market, the value shall be
the fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board.

(B) The method of valuation of securities subject to investment
letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of
a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount
from the market value determined as above in (A) (1), (2) or (3) to reflect the approximate fair
market value thereof, as determined by the Board.

(C) The foregoing methods for valuing non-cash consideration
to be distributed in connection with a Liquidation Event may be superseded by any determination
of such value set forth in the definitive agreements governing such Liquidation Event.

(iii) In the event the requirements of this Section 2 are not complied
with, the Liquidation Azuro Entity shall forthwith either:

(A) cause such closing to be postponed until such time as the
requirements of this Section 2 have been complied with; or

(B) cancel such transaction, in which event the rights,
preferences and privileges of the holders of Preferred Stock shall revert to and be the same as
such rights, preferences and privileges existing immediately prior to the date of the first notice
referred to in subsection 2(d){iv) hereof.

(iv) The Corporation shall give each holder of record of Preferred
Stock written notice of such impending transaction not later than twenty (20) days prior to the
stockholders’ meeting called to approve such transaction, or twenty (20) days prior to the closing

USIDOCS 7337678v1
of such transaction, whichever is earlier, and shall also notify such holders in writing of the final
approval of such transaction. Such notice shall describe the material terms and conditions of the
impending transaction and the provisions of this Section 2. The transaction shall in no event take
place sooner than twenty (20) days after the Corporation has given such notice provided for
herein; provided, however, that such period may be shortened upon the written consent of the
holders of Preferred Stock that (i) are entitled to such notice rights or similar notice rights and
(ii) represent at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (667%) of the voting power of all then
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class and not as separate series,
and on an as-converted basis). The holders of the outstanding Preferred Stock can waive the
notice requirements described in this subsection (iv) upon the affirmative vote or written consent
of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (6674%) of the shares of Preferred Stock
then outstanding (voting together as a single class and not as separate series, and on an as-
converted basis).

3. Redemption. The Preferred Stock is not redeemable at the option of the
holder.

4. Conversion. The holders of Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights
as follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at
the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share, at the office
of the Corporation or any transfer agent for such stock, into such number of fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the applicable Original
Issue Price for such series of Preferred Stock by the applicable Conversion Price for such series
of Preferred Stock (the conversion rate for a series of Preferred Stock into Common Stock is
referred to herein as the “Conversion Rate” for such series of Preferred Stock), determined as
hereafter provided, in effect on the date the certificate is surrendered for conversion. The initial
“Conversion Price” per share for each series of Preferred Stock shall be the Original Issue Price
applicable to such series of Preferred Stock; provided, however, that the Conversion Price for the
Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in subsection 4(d).

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically
be converted into shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Rate at the time in effect for such
series of Preferred Stock immediately upon the earlier of (i) the Corporation’s sale of its
Common Stock in a firm commitment underwritten public offering where (A) the public offering
price of which is at least $7.25 per share (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends,
combinations, subdivisions, recapitalizations or the like) and the aggregate proceeds to the
Corporation is at least $25,000,000 and (B) in connection with such offering the Common Stock
is subsequently primarily traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market’s National Market, the New York
Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange or another comparable exchange or marketplace
approved by the Board (each, a “Securities Exchange”) (such offering, as described in the
immediately preceding clauses (A) and (B), shall be referred to herein as a “Qualified Public
Offering”) or (ii) the date specified by written consent or agreement of the holders of (X) sixty-
six and two-thirds percent (6674%) of the then outstanding shares of Preferred B Stock (voting as
separate series and on an as-converted basis) and (Y) sixty-six and two-thirds percent (6674%) of

US1DOCS 7337678v)
the then outstanding shares of Preferred A Stock (voting as separate series and on an as-
converted basis).

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to voluntarily convert the same into shares of Common Stock, he or she shall surrender
the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any
transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the Corporation at its
principal corporate office, of the election to convert the same and shall state therein the name or
names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued. The
Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such
holder of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as
aforesaid. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of
business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the
person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion
shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock
as of such date. If the conversion is in connection with an underwritten offering of securities
registered pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the conversion may, at the option
of any holder tendering Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the
underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering, in which event the persons
entitled to receive the Common Stock upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall not be
deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such
sale of securities. If the conversion is in connection with Automatic Conversion provisions of
subsection 4(b)(ii) above, such conversion shall be deemed to have been made on the conversion
date described in the stockholder consent approving such conversion, and the persons entitled to
receive shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes
as the record holders of such shares of Common Stock as of such date.

(d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock for Certain Dilutive
Issuances, Splits and Combinations. The Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock shall be
subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

(i) (A) _ If the Corporation shall issue, on or after the date upon which
the first share of Series B Preferred Stock is issued (the “Filing Date”), any Additional Stock (as
defined below) without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Conversion
Price applicable to the Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, as the case may be,
in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock, the applicable Conversion
Price for such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall
forthwith (except as otherwise provided in this clause (i)) be adjusted to a price determined by
multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which shall be the number
of shares of Common Stock Outstanding (as defined below) immediately prior to such issuance
plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received by the
Corporation for such issuance of Additional Stock would purchase at the applicable Conversion
Price; and (ii) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock
Outstanding (as defined below) immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares of
such Additional Stock. For purposes of this Section 4(d)(i)(A), the term “Common Stock
Outstanding” shall mean the sum of the following: (1) the outstanding Common Stock, (2)

USIDOCS 7337678v1
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of outstanding Preferred Stock, (3) Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options and (4) Common Stock issuable upon
exercise (and, in the case of warrants to purchase Preferred Stock, conversion) of outstanding
warrants. Shares described in (1) through (4) above shall be included whether vested or
unvested, whether contingent or non-contingent and whether exercisable or not yet exercisable.

(B) No adjustment of the applicable Conversion Price for any
series of Preferred Stock shall be made in an amount less than one cent per share, provided that
any adjustments that are not required to be made by reason of this sentence shall be carried
forward and shall be either taken into account in any subsequent adjustment made prior to three
(3) years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward, or shall
be made at the end of three (3) years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment
being carried forward. Except to the limited extent provided for in subsections (E)(3) and (E)(4),
no adjustment of such Conversion Price pursuant to this subsection 4(d)(i) shall have the effect
of increasing the applicable Conversion Price above the applicable Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such adjustment.

(C) In the case of the issuance of Additional Stock for cash, the
consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting any
reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the
Corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

(D) In the case of the issuance of the Additional Stock for a
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be
deemed to be the fair market value thereof as determined by the Board in good faith irrespective
of any accounting treatment.

(E) In the case of the issuance of options to purchase or rights
to subscribe for Common Stock, securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for
Common Stock or options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or
exchangeable securities, the following provisions shall apply for purposes of determining the
number of shares of Additional Stock issued and the consideration paid therefor:

(1) The aggregate maximum number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable upon exercise (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to
exercisability, including without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account
potential antidilution adjustments) of such options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common
Stock shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such options or rights were issued and for
a consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in subsections
4(d)(i)(C) and (d)(i)(D)), if any, received by this corporation upon the issuance of such options
or rights plus the minimum exercise price provided in such options or rights (without taking into
account potential antidilution adjustments) for the Common Stock covered thereby.

(2) The aggregate maximum number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of, or in exchange (assuming the satisfaction of any
conditions to convertibility or exchangeability, including, without limitation, the passage of time,
but without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) for, any such convertible or

USIDOCS 7337678v1
exchangeable securities or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for
such convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof shall
be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or such options or rights
were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration, if any, received by this
corporation for any such securities and related options or rights (excluding any cash received on
account of accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the minimum additional consideration, if
any, to be received by the Corporation (without taking into account potential antidilution
adjustments) upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or the exercise of any related
options or rights (the consideration in each case to be determined in the manner provided in
subsections 4(d)(i)(C) and (d)(i)(D)).

(3) — In the event of any change in the number of shares
of Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon exercise
of such options or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such convertible or
exchangeable securities, the Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way
affected by or computed using such options, rights or securities, shall be recomputed to reflect
such change, but no further adjustment shall be made for the actual issuance of Common Stock
or any payment of such consideration upon the exercise of any such options or rights or the
conversion or exchange of such securities.

(4) | Upon the expiration of any such options or rights,
the termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options or
rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the applicable Conversion Price of
the Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, rights
or securities or options or rights related to such securities, shall be recomputed to reflect the
issuance of only the number of shares of Common Stock (and convertible or exchangeable
securities that remain in effect) actually issued upon the exercise of such options or rights, upon
the conversion or exchange of such securities or upon the exercise of the options or rights related
to such securities.

(5) | The number of shares of Additional Stock deemed
issued and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to subsections 4(d)(i)(E)(1) and (2)
shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or expiration of the type
described in either subsection 4(d)(i)(E)(3) or (4).

(ii) “Additional Stock” shall mean any shares of Common Stock issued
(or deemed to have been issued pursuant to subsection 4(d)(i)(E)) by this corporation on or after
the Filing Date other than:

(A) Common Stock issued pursuant to a transaction described
in subsection 4(d)(iii) hereof;

(B) Common Stock (or options therefor) issued or sold to
employees, directors, consultants and other service providers for the primary purpose of
soliciting or retaining their services pursuant to plans or agreements approved by the Board and
by the holders of at least sixty six and two thirds percent (6674%) of the outstanding Preferred
Stock (voting together as a single class and not as a separate series and on an as converted basis);

USIDOCS 7337678v1
(C) Common Stock issued pursuant to a Qualified Public
Offering;

{(D) Common Stock issued pursuant to the conversion or
exercise of convertible or exercisable securities outstanding at the Initial Closing (as defined in
that certain Series B Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement by and among the Corporation and
certain of its shareholders dated on or about December 2, 2005);

(E) Common Stock issued pursuant to the conversion or
exercise of convertible or exercisable securities issued pursuant that certain Series B Preferred
Stock Purchase Agreement by and among the Corporation and certain of its shareholders dated
on or about November 13, 2007;

(F) Common Stock issued in connection with a bona fide
business acquisition of or by the Corporation, whether by merger, consolidation, sale of the
assets, sale or exchange of stock or otherwise, which acquisition has been approved by the
Board;

(G) Common Stock issued pursuant to strategic transactions,
equipment lease financings or bank credit arrangements entered into for primarily non-equity
financing purposes; or

(H) Common Stock issued or deemed issued pursuant to
subsection 4(d)(i)(E) as a result of a decrease in the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred
Stock resulting from the operation of this Section 4(d).

(iii) If the Corporation shall, on or after the Filing Date fix a record date
for the effectuation of a split or subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or the
determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution
payable in additional shares of Common Stock or other securities or rights convertible into, or
entitling the holder thereof to receive, directly or indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock
(hereinafter referred to as “Common Stock Equivalents’), then, as of such record date (or the
date of such dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no record date is fixed), the Conversion
Price of each series of Preferred Stock shall be appropriately decreased so that the number of
shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series of Preferred Stock
shall be increased in proportion to such increase of the aggregate of shares of Common Stock
outstanding and those issuable with respect to such Common Stock Equivalents.

(iv) If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any time
after the Filing Date is decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of Common Stock,
then, following the record date of such combination, the Conversion Price for the Preferred Stock
shall be appropriately increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on
conversion of each share of such series of Preferred Stock shall be decreased in proportion to
such decrease in outstanding shares.

(e) Other Distributions. In the event the Corporation shall declare a
distribution payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by the
Corporation or other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred

10

USIDOCS 7337678yv1
to in subsection 4(d)(iii), then, in each such case for the purpose of this subsection 4(e), the
holders of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any such distribution
as though they were the holders of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation
into which their shares of Preferred Stock are convertible as of the record date fixed for the
determination of the holders of Common Stock of the Corporation entitled to receive such
distribution.

(f) Recapitalizations. If at any time or from time to time there shall be a
recapitalization of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision, combination or merger or sale
of assets transaction provided for elsewhere in this Section 4 or Section 2) provision shall be
made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon
conversion of the Preferred Stock the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of
the Corporation or otherwise, to which a holder of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion
would have been entitled on such recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall
be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 4 with respect to the rights of the
holders of the Preferred Stock after the recapitalization to the end that the provisions of this
Section 4 (including adjustment of the applicable Conversion Price then in effect and the number
of shares purchasable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event
as nearly equivalent as may be practicable.

(g) | NoImpairment. The Corporation will not, without the appropriate vote of
the stockholders under the General Corporation Law or Section 6 of this Article IV(B), by
amendment of its Certificate of Incorporation or through any reorganization, recapitalization,
transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other
voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be
observed or performed hereunder by the Corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in
the carrying out of all the provisions of this Section 4 and in the taking of all such action as may
be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the Conversion Rights of the holders of the
Preferred Stock against impairment.

(h) No Fractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments.

(i) No fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of any
share or shares of Preferred Stock and the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock to be
issued to particular stockholders, shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share and the
Corporation shall pay in cash the fair value of any fractional shares as of the time when entitled
to receive such fractions are determined.

(ii) Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the
Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation, at
its expense, shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the
terms hereof and prepare and furnish to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth
such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or
readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder
of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth
(A) such adjustment and readjustment, (B) the applicable Conversion Price for such series of
Preferred Stock at the time in effect, and (C) the number of shares of Common Stock and the

1]

US1DOCS 7337678yt
amount, if any, of other property that at the time would be received upon the conversion of a
share of Preferred Stock.

(i) Notices of Record Date. In the event of any taking by the Corporation of a
record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof
who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend) or other distribution, the
Corporation shall mail to each holder of Preferred Stock, at least ten (10) days prior to the date
specified therein, a notice specifying the date on which any such record is to be taken for the
purpose of such dividend, distribution, and the amount and character of such dividend or
distribution.

(j) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at
all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock,
solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock, such
number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, in addition to such other remedies as shall
be available to the holder of such Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate
action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes,
including, without limitation, engaging in reasonable best efforts to obtain the requisite
stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to this Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation.

(k) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Section 4 to be
given to the holders of shares of Preferred Stock (i) shall be deemed given if delivered
personally, sent via internationally recognized overnight courier service, via electronic
transmission, via facsimile or deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, and addressed
to each holder of record at his address appearing on the books of the Corporation and (ii) may be
waived by the holders of sixty-six and two-thirds percent (667%4%) of the outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock.

(1) Waiver of Adjustment to Conversion Price. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary (including, but not limited to, Section 4(g)), any downward adjustment of

the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock may be waived, either prospectively or
retroactively or in a particular instance, by the consent or vote of the holders of sixty-six and
two-thirds percent (66%4%) of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (voting together as a
single class and not as separate series, and on an as-converted basis). Any such waiver shall bind
all future holders of shares of such series of Preferred Stock.

5. Voting Rights.

(a) General Voting Rights. The holder of each share of Preferred Stock shall
have the right to one vote for each share of Common Stock into which such Preferred Stock
could then be converted, and with respect to such vote, such holder shall have full voting rights
and powers equal to the voting rights and powers of the holders of Common Stock, and shall be

12

US1DOCS 7337678v!
entitled, notwithstanding any provision hereof, to notice of any stockholders’ meeting in
accordance with the Bylaws of the Corporation, and, shall be entitled to vote, together with
holders of Common Stock, with respect to any question upon which holders of Common Stock
have the right to vote except as required by the General Corporation Law. Fractional votes shall
not, however, be permitted and any fractional voting rights available on an as-converted basis
(after aggregating all shares into which shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder could be
converted) shall be rounded to the nearest whole number (with one-half being rounded upward).

(b) Voting for the Election of Directors. As long as 500,000 shares (as
adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, subdivisions, recapitalizations or the
like) of Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding, the holders of such shares of Series A
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to elect one (1) director of the Corporation at any election of
directors (each a “Series A Director”), and as long as 500,000 shares (as adjusted for any stock
splits, stock dividends, combinations, subdivisions, recapitalizations or the like) of Series B
Preferred Stock are outstanding, the holders of such shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to elect one (1) director of the Corporation at any election of directors (the “Series B
Director” and together with the Series A Director, the “Preferred Directors”). The holders of
outstanding Common Stock shall be entitled to elect one (1) director of the Corporation at any
election of directors. The holders of Preferred Stock and Common Stock (voting together as a
single class and not as separate classes, and on an as-converted to Common Stock basis) shall be
entitled to elect any remaining directors of the Corporation.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 223(a)(1) and 223(a)(2) of the General
Corporation Law, any vacancy, including newly created directorships resulting from any
increase in the authorized number of directors or amendment of this Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, and vacancies created by removal or resignation of a director, may
be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, though less than a quorum, or by a sole
remaining director, and the directors so chosen shall hold office until the next annual election
and until their successors are duly elected and shall qualify, unless sooner displaced; provided,
however, that where such vacancy occurs among the directors elected by the holders of a class or
series of stock, the holders of shares of such class or series may override the Board’s action to
fill such vacancy by (i) voting for their own designee to fill such vacancy at a meeting of the
Corporation’s stockholders or (ii) written consent, if the consenting stockholders hold a
sufficient number of shares to elect their designee at a meeting of the stockholders. Any director
elected as provided in the immediately preceding sentence hereof may be removed during the
aforesaid term of office, either with or without cause, by, and only by, the affirmative vote of the
holders of the shares of the class or series of stock entitled to elect such director or directors,
given either at a special meeting of such stockholders duly called for that purpose or pursuant to
a written consent of stockholders, provided, however, that in the case of a director elected by the
holders of Series A Preferred Stock, removal of such director requires the affirmative vote of the
holders of sixty-six and two-thirds percent (6673%) of the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock;
any vacancy thereby created may be filled by the holders of that class or series of stock
represented at the meeting or pursuant to written consent.

6. Protective Provisions. So long as at least (i) 500,000 shares (as adjusted
for any stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, subdivisions, recapitalizations or the like) of
Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Corporation shall not (by amendment, merger,

13

USIDOCS 7337678v1
consolidation or otherwise), without first obtaining the approval (by vote or written consent, as
provided by law) of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66%4%) of the
outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock (voting as separate series, and on an as-converted
basis) and (ii) 500,000 shares (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, combinations,
subdivisions, recapitalizations or the like) of Series B Preferred Stock are outstanding, the
Corporation shall not (by amendment, merger, consolidation or otherwise), without first
obtaining the approval (by vote or written consent, as provided by law) of the holders of at least
seventy five percent (75%) of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock (voting as
separate series, and on an as-converted basis), cause either the Corporation or any direct or
indirect subsidiary of the Corporation (each such entity, including, without limitation, the
Corporation, shall be referred to as an “Azuro Entity”) to:

(a) consummate or agree to consummate a Liquidation Event with respect to
an Azuro Entity;

(b) alter or change the rights, preferences or privileges of the shares of
Common Stock or Preferred Stock (or any series thereof) of the Corporation or the applicable
capital stock of any other Azuro Entity, provided, however, that this restriction shall not apply to
an immaterial Azuro Entity where such alteration or change has been approved by the Board,
including a majority of the Preferred Directors;

(c) pay or declare payment of any dividend or other distribution on any shares
of capital stock of an Azuro Entity (other than dividends payable solely to another Azuro Entity)
or distribute or transfer the Proceeds of any Liquidation Event other than pursuant to the
provisions of Section 2 hereof;

(d) increase or decrease (other than by redemption or conversion) the total
number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock (or any series thereof) of the
Corporation or the applicable capital stock of any other Azuro Entity, provided, however, that
this restriction shall not apply to an immaterial Azuro Entity where such increase or decrease has
been approved by the Board, including a majority of the Preferred Directors;

(e) authorize or issue, or obligate itself to authorize or issue, any security
(including any other security convertible into or exercisable for any such security) of an Azuro
Entity (other than issuances solely to another Azuro Entity); provided, however, that this
restriction shall not apply to grants of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation (or options
therefor) pursuant to a stock option, stock purchase, equity incentive or comparable scheme or
plan for an Azuro Entity (an “Incentive Program”) to employees, officers, directors, consultants
or other persons performing services for an Azuro Entity which (i) grants are approved by (A)
the Board or (B) approved by a committee of the Board to which the granting of shares of
Common Stock of the Corporation (or options therefor) has been delegated by the Board and
with such grants to be ratified by the Board from time to time and (ii) schemes or plans are
approved by the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (667%) of the then
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (including, without limitation, any future designated series
of Preferred Stock, and voting together as a single class and not as separate series, and on an as-
converted basis);

14

USIDOCS 7337678v1
(f) redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire (or pay into or set aside for a
sinking fund for such purpose) any share or shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock of the
Corporation or the applicable capital stock of any other Azuro Entity; provided, however, that
this restriction shall not apply to the repurchase of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation
from employees, officers, directors, consultants or other persons performing services for an
Azuro Entity pursuant to agreements under which this corporation has the option to repurchase
such shares at cost upon the termination of employment or pursuant to a right of first refusal;

(g) amend, revise or repeal an Azuro Entity’s Certificate of Incorporation or
Bylaws or comparable charter documents, or any part thereof;

(h) sell the capital stock of an Azuro Entity pursuant to a public offering or
listing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (or the laws, rules or regulations of any
other jurisdiction);

(i) change the authorized number of, or method of electing, the directors of an
Azuro Entity; or

(3) adopt, amend, revise or repeal an Incentive Program.

7. Status of Converted Stock. In the event any shares of Preferred Stock
shall be converted pursuant to Section 4 hereof, the shares so converted shall be cancelled and
shall not be issuable by the Corporation. This Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation shall be appropriately amended to effect the corresponding reduction in the
Corporation’s authorized capital stock.

C. Common Stock. The rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions
granted to and imposed on the Common Stock are as set forth below in this Article [V(C).

right to one vote for each such share, and shall be entitled to notice of any stockholders’ meeting

and in such manner as may be provided by law. Subject to Section 6 of Article IV, Section B of
this Amend and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the number of authorized shares of
Common Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then
outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock of the Corporation
