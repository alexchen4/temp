4. Conversion. The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall have conversion
rights as follows (the “Serics A Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Series A Preferrec Stock shall be
convertible, at the option of the holder t' zreof, at any time after the date of issuance of such
share, at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for such stock, into such number of
fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Original

or (ii) the date specified by written consent or agreement of the holders of a majority of the then
outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock. If a closing of a QPO occurs, all outstanding
shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have been converted into shares of
Common Stock immediately prior to such closing.

6
(c) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Series A Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock, the holder shall surrender the
certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any
transfer agent for the Series A Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the Corporation at
its principal corporate office, of the election to convert the same and shall state therein the name
or names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued.
The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver to such holder of Series
A Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for
the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid and a
certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, if any, that were
not converted by such holder. Subject to the last sentence of subsection 4(b) above, such
conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the
date of such surrender of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person
or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall
be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock as of
such date. If the conversion is in connection with an underwritten offering of securities
registered pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 (other than a QPO) or an Extraordinary
Transaction, the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering Series A Preferred Stock
for conversion, be conditioed upon the closing of such offering or Extraordinary Transaction, in
which event the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock upon such conversion of the
Series A Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Series A Preferred Stock
until immediately prior to the closing of such offering or Extraordinary Transaction.

(d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Series A Preferred Stock for Certain
Dilutive Issuances. The Series A Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment from time to
time as follews:

(i) (A) _ Ifthe Corporation shall issue, after the Filing Date, any
Additional Stock (as defined in subsection 4(d)(iii)(C)) without consideration or for a
consideration per share less than the Series D-3 Conversion Price (as defined in Section IX.4(a))
in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock, the Series A Conversion
Price in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall forthwith (except as otherwise
provided in this clause (d)) be adjusted to a price determined by multiplying such Series A
Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance (assuming the conversion into
Common Stock of all outstanding Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred and Series C
Preferred Stock and not including shares issuable upon conversion of any other Convertible
Securities (as defined in subsection 4(d)iii)(B)) or any Options (as defined in subsection
4(d\iii)(A)), plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration
received by the Corporation for such issuance would purchase at such Series D-3 Conversion
Price (as defined in Section [X.4(a)) in effect immediately prior to such issuance of Additional
Stock; and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding imme:iiately prior to such issuance (assuming the conversion into Common Stock of
all outstanding Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred and Series C Preferred Stock and not
including shares issuable upon conversion of any other Convertible Securities (as defined in
subsection 4(d)iii/B)) or any Options (as defined in subsection 4(d)iii}{A)), plus the number of
shares of such Additional Stock.
(B) No adjustment of the Series A Conversion Price shall be
made in an amount less than one cent per share, provided that any adjustments which are not
reauired to be made by reason of this sentence shall be carried forward and shall be eithez taken
into account in any subsequent adjustment made prior to 3 years from the date the event giving
rise to the adjustment being carried forward, or shall be made at the end of 3 years from the date
of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward. Except to the limited extent
provided for in subsection 4(d)(ii)(D), no adjustment of such Series A Conversion Price pursuant
to this subsection 4(d) shall have the effect of increasing the Series A Conversion Price above the
Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment.

(C) Inthe case of the issuance of Common Stock for cash, the
consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting any
discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the Corporation for any
underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

(D) Inthe case of the issuance of the Common Stock for a
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be
deemed to be the fair value thereof as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation.

(ii) Issue of Securities Deemed Issue of Additional Stock.

(A) _ Ifthe Corporation at any time or from time to time after the
Filing Date shall issue any Options (as defined in subsection 4(d){iii)(A)) or Convertible

which, upon exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, would entitle the holder thereof to receive
shares of Common Stock which are specifically excepted from the definition of Additional Stock
by subsection 4(d){iii)(A) or (B)), or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of
any class of securities entitled to receive any such Options or Convertible Securities, then the
maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set forth in te instrument relating thereto
without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number)
issuable upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities and Options
therefor, the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to be
Additional Stock issued as of the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shall have been
fixed, as of the close of business on such record date.

(B) Ifthe terms of any Option or Convertible Security, ‘=
issuance of which resulted in an adjustment to the Series A Conversion Price after the Filing
Date pursuant to the terms of subsection 4(d\ii)(A) above, are revised (either automatically
pursuant the provisions contained therein or as a result of an amendment to such terms) to
provide for either (1) any increase in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the
exercise, conversion or exchange of any such Option or Convertible Security or (2) any decrease
in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion or exchange,
then, effective upon such increase or decrease becoming effective, the Series A Conversion Price
computed upon the original issue of such Option or Convertible Security (or upon the occurrence
of a record date with respect thereto) shall be readjusted to such Series A Conversion Price as
would have been obtained had such revised terms been in effect upon the original date of

8
issuance of such Option or Convertible Security. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustinent
pursuant to this clause (B) shall have the effect of increasing the Series A Conversion Price to an
amount which exceeds the lower of (i) the Series A Conversion Price on the origi:ial adjustment
date, or (ii) the Series A Conversion Price that would have resulted from any issuances of
Additional Stock between the original adjustment date and such readjustment date.

(C) If the terms of any Option or Convertible Security
(excluding Options or Convertible Securities which, upon exercise, conversion or exchange
thereof, would entitle the holder thereof to receive shares of Common Stock which are
specifically excepted from the definition of Additional Stock in subsection 4(d)(iii)(A) or (B)),
the issuance of which did not result in an adjustment to the Series A Conversion Price pursuant
to the terms of subsection 4(d){i)(A) (either because the consideration per share (determined
pursuant to subsection 4(d)(i)(C) and (D) hereof) of the shares of Additional Stock subject
thereto was equal to or greater than the applicable Series A Conversion Price then in effect, or
because such Option or Convertible Security was issued before the Filing Date), are revised after
the Filing Date (either automatically pursuant to the provisions contained therein or as a result of
an amendment to such terms, but excluding automatic revisions of conversion ratios of any
Preferred Stock pursuant to the provisions of the Preferred Stock existing on the Filing Date) to
provide for either (1) any increase in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the
exercise, conversion or exchange of any such Option or Convertible Security or (2) any decrease
in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion or exchange, then
such Option or Convertible Security, as so amended, and the shares of Additional Stock subject
thereto (determined in the manner provided in subsection 4(d)(ii)(A) above) shall be deemed to
have been issued effective upon such increase or decrease becoming effective.

(D) Upon the expiration or termination of any such Options or
any rights of conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have
been exercised or converted, the Series A Conversion Price computed upon the original issue
thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto) and any subsequent
adjustments based thereon shall, upon such expiration or termination, be recomputed as if:

(1) in the case of Convertible Securities or Options for
Common Stock, the only shares of Additional Stock issued were the shares of Common Stock, if
any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities and the consideration rece!ved therefor was the consideration actually
received by the Corporation for the issue of all such Options, whether or not exercised, plus the
consideration actually received by the Corporation upon such exercise, or for the issue of all such
Convertible Securities which were actually converted or exchanged, plus the additional
consideration, if any, actually received by the Corporation upon such conversion or exchange,
and

(2) in the case of Options for Convertible Securities,
only the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were issued at
the time of issue of such Options, and the consideration received by the Corporation for the
shares of Additional Stock deemed to have been then issued was the consideration actually
received by the Corporation for the issue of all such Options, whether or not exercised, plus the
consideration deemed to have been received by the Corporation (determined pursuant to

$
subsection 4(d)(i)(C) and (D)) upon the issue of the Convertible Securities with respect to which
such Options were actually exercised.

(E) No further adjustment in the Series A Conversion Price
shall be :nade upon the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities or shares of Common Stock
upon the exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities.

(F) Inthe case of any Options which expire by their terms not
more than thirty (30) days after the date of issue thereof, no adjustment of the Series A
Conversion Price shall be made until the expiration or exercise of all such Options, whereupon
such adjustment shall be made in the same manner provided in clause (D) above.

Preferred Stock without making a corresponding combination of the Series B Preferred Stock,
Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock, then the Series A Conversion Price in
effect immediately before that combination shall be proportionately decreased. If the
Corporation shall at any time or from time to time after the Filing Date combine the outstanding

10
shares of Common Stock, the Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately before that
combination shall be proportionately increased. If the Corporation shall at any time or from time
to time after the Filing Date effect a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred
Stock without effecting a corresponding subdivision of the Series B Preferred Stock, Series C
Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock, the Series A Conversion Price in effect
immediately before that subdivision shall be proportionately increased. Any adjustment under
this paragraph shall become effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or
combination becomes effective.

Distributions. In the event the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Filing Date

shall make or issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock
entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in additional sheres of Common
Stock, then and in each such event the Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately before
such event shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance or, in the event such a record date
shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, by multiplying the Series A
Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction:

(i) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the
close of business on such record date, and

(ii) | the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the
close of business on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in
payment of such dividend or distribution; provided, however, if such record date shall have been
fixed and such dividend is not fully paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed
therefor, the Series A Conversion Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of
business on such record date and thereafter the Series A Conversion Price shall be adjusted
pursuant to this paragraph as of the time of actual payment of such dividends or distributions;
and provided further, however, that no such adjustment shall be made if the holders of Series A
Prefirred Stock simultaneously receive (i) a dividend or other distribution of shares of Common
Stock in a number equal to the number of shares of Common Stock as they would have received
if all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock on
the date of such event or (ii) a dividend or other distribution of shares of Series A Preferred
Stock which are convertible, as of the date of such event, into such number of shares of Common
Stock as is equal to the number of shares of Common Stock as they would have received if all
outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock on the
date of such event.

(g) Adjustments to Series A Stock for Other Dividends and
Distnbutions. In the event the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Filing Date
shal] make or issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock
entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the Corporation (other
than shares of Common Stock) or in cash or other property (other than regular cash dividends
paid out of earnings or earned surplus, determined in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles), then and in each such event provision shall be made so that the holders of

11
the Series “. Preferre? Stock shall receive upon conversion thereof in addition to the number of
shares cf Common Stock receivable thereupon, the kind and amount of securities of the
Corporation, cash or other property which they would have been entitled to receive had the
Series A Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event and had
they thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to and including the conversion
date, retained such securities reccivable by them as aforesaid during such period, giving
application to all adjustments called for during such period under this paragraph with respect to
the rights of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock; provided that no such adjustment shall
be made if the holders of Series A Preferred Stock simultaneously receive a dividend or other
distribution of such securities, cash, or other property in an amount equal to the amount of such
securities, cash, or other property as they would have received if all outstanding shares of Series
A Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event.

(t. Recapitalizations, Reclassifications, Exchanges and Substitutions. If at
any time or from time to time, whether pursuant to a transaction with another entity or otherwise,

Common Stock (other than pursuant to a subdivision, combination or merger or sale of assets
transaction provided for elsewhere in subsection 3 or this subsection 4), provision shall be made
so that the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon
conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock the kind and amount of stock or otl.er securities or
property to which a holder of the Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of the Series A
Preferred Stock would have been entitled on the recapitalization, reclassification, exchange,
substitution or other change. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the
application of the provisions of this subsection 4 with respect to the rights of the holders of the
Series A Preferred Stock after such recapitalization, reclassification, exchange, substitution or
other change, to the end that the provisions of this subsection 4 (including adjustment of the
Series A Conversion Price then in effect and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of
the Series A Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event as nearly equivalent as may be
practicable.

(i) No Impairment. The Corporation will not, by amendment of its Articles
of Incorporation or through any reorganization, recapitalization, transfer of assets, consolidation,
merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to
avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder
by the Corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the
provisions of this subsection 4 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or
appropriate in order to protect the Series A Conversion Rights against impairment.

(j) No Fractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments.

(i) No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon
conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock. All shares of Common Stock (including fractions
thereof) issuable upon conversion of more than one share of Series A Preferred Stock by a holder
thereof shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the conversion would result in
the issuance of any fractional share. If, after the aforementioned aggregation, the conversion
would result in the issuance of any fractional share, the Corporation shall, ia lieu of issuing any
fractional share, pay cash equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by the Common

12
Stock’s fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation) on the date of conversion.

(ii) | Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the
Series A Conversion Price pursuant to this subsection 4, the Corporation, at its expense, shall
promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and
prepare and furnish to each holder of Series A Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such
adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or
readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder
of Series A Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate
setting forth (A) such adjustment and readjustment, (B) the Series A Conversion Price at the time
in effect, and (C) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other
property which at the time would be received upon the conversion of a share of Series A
Preferred Stock.

record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof
who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend) or other distribution, any
right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of stock of any class or any other
securities or property, or to receive any other right, the Corporation shall mail to each holder of
Series A Preferred Stock, at least 20 days prior to the date specified therein, a notice specifying
the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or
right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right.

all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Comraon Stock,

sulely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock,
such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock; and if at any time the
number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, in addition to such
other remedies as shall be available to the holder of such Preferred Stock, the Corporation will
take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient
for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite
shareholder approval of any necessary amendment to the Corporation’s Articles of Incorporation.

(m) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this subsection 4 to be

entitled, notwithstanding any provision hereof, to notice of any shareholders’ meeting in

13
accordance with the lyyluws of the Corporation, and shall be entitled to vote, together with
holders of Common Stock, with respect te any question upon which holders of Common Stock
have the right to vote, except as may be otherwise provided by applicable law. Except as
otherwise expressly provided herein or as required by law, the holders of Series A Preferred

Fractional votes shall not, however, be permitted and any fractional voting rights available on an
as-converted basis (after aggregating all shares into which shares of Series A Preferred Stock
held by each holder could be converted) shall be rounded to the nearest whole number (with one-
half being rounded upward).

6. Protective Provisions. So long as any shares of Series A Preferred Stock are
issued and outstanding, the Corporation shall not without first obtaining the approval (by vote or

Price in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall forthwith (except as otherwise
provided in this clause (d)) be adjusted to a price determined by multiplying such Series B
Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance (assuming the conversion into
Common Stock of all outstanding Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred and Series C
Preferred Stock and not including shares issuable upon conversion of any other Convertible
Securities (as defined in subsection 4(d}{iii)(B)) or any Options (as defined in subsection
4(d){iii)(A)), plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration
received by the Corporation for such issuance would purchase at such Series D-3 Conversioa
Price (as defined in Section [X.4(a)) in effect immediately prior to such issuance of Additional

outstanding immediately prior to such issuance (assuming the conversion into Common Stock of
all outstanding Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred and Series C Preferred Stock and not
including shares issuable upon conversion of any other Convertible Securities (as defined in
subsection 4(d)(iii)(B)) or any Options (as defined in subsection 4(d)(iii)(A)), plus the number of
shares of such Additional Stock.

into account in any subsequent adjustment made prior to 3 years from the date the event giving
rise to the adjustment being carried forward, or shall be made at the end of 3 years from the date
of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward. Except to the limited extent
provided for in subsection 4(d\{ii(D), no adjustment of such Series B Conversion Price pursuant
to this subsection 4(d) shall have the effect of increasing the Series B Conversion Price above the
Series B Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment.

consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting any
discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the Corporation for any
underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

17

shares of Common Stock which are specifically excepted from the definition of Additional Stock
by subsection 4(d){iii)(A) or (B)), or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of
any class of securities entitled to receive any such Options or Convertible Securities, then the
maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto
without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number)
issuable upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities and Options
therefor, the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to be
Additional Stock issued as of the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shall have been
fixed, as of the close of business on such record date.

(B) If the terms of any Option or Convertible Security, the
issuance of which resulted in an adjustment to the Series B Conversion Price after tne Filing
Date pursuant to the terms of subsection 4(d){ii)(A) above, are revised (either automaticaily
pursuant the provisions contained therein or as a result of an amendment to such terms) to
provide for either (1) any increase in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the
exercise, conversion or exchange of any such Option or Convertible Security or (2) any decrease
in the consideration payable to the Corporation upor. such exercise, conversion or exchange,
then, effective upon such increase or decrease becoming effective, the Series B Conversion Price
computed upon the original issue of such Option or Cenvertible Security (or upon the occurrence
of a record date with respect thereto) shall be readjusted to such Series B Conversion Price as
would have been obtained had such revised terms been in effect upon the original date of
issuance of such Option or Convertib!e Security. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment
pursuant to this clause (B) shall have the effect of increasing the Series B Conversion Price to an
amount which exceeds the lower of (i) the Series B Conversion Price on the original adjustment
date. or (ii) the Series B Conversion Price that would have resulted from any issuances of
Additional Stock between the original adjustment date and such readjustment date.

(excluding Options or Convertible Securities which, upon exercise, conversion or exchange
thereof, would entitle the holder thereof to receive shares of Common Stock which are
specifically excepted from the definition of Additional Stock in subsection 4(d)iii(A) or (B)),
the issuance of which did not result in an adjustment to the Series B Conversion Price pursuant
to the terms of subsection 4(d){i)(A) (either because the consideration per share (determined
pursuant to subsection 4(d){i(C) and (D) hereof) of the shares of Additional Stock subject
thereto was equal to or greater than the applicable Series B Conversion Price then in effect, or
because such Option or Convertible Security was issued before the Filing Date), are revised after

18
the Filing Date (either automatically pursuant to the provisions contained therein or as a result of
an amendment to such terms, but excluding automatic revisions of conversion ratios of any
Preferred Stock pursuant to the provisions of the Preferred Stock existing on the Filing Date) to
provide tor either (1) any increase in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the
exercise, conversion or exchange of any such Option or Convertible Security or (2) any decrease
in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion or exchange, then
such Option or Convertible Security, as so amended, and the shares of Additional Stuck subject
ti.ereto (determined in the manner provided in subsection 4(d)(ii)(A) above) shall be deemed to
have been issued effective upon such increase or decrease becoming effective.

(Db) Upon the expiration or termination of any such Options or
any rights of conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have
been exercised or converted, the Series B Conversion Price computed upon the original issue
thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto) and any subsequent
adjustments based thereon shall, upon such expiration or termination, be recomputed as if:

(1) inthe cu. of Convertible Securities or Options for
Common Stock, the only shares of Additional Stock issued were the shares of Common Stock, if
any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities and tue consideration received therefor was the consideration actually
received by the Corporation for the issue of all such Options, whether or not exercised, plus the
consideration actually received by the Corporation upon such exercise, or for the issue of all such
Convertible Securities which were actually converted or exchanged, plus the additional
consideration, if any, actually received by the Corporation upon such conversion or exchange,
and

(2) in the case of Options for Convertible Securities,
only the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were issued at
the time of issue of such Options, and the consideration received by the Corporation for the
shares of Additional Stock deemed to have been then issued was the consideration actually
received by the Corporation for the issue of all such Options, whether or not exercised, plus the
consideration deemed to have been received by the Corporation (determined pursuant to
subsection 4(d)(i)(C) and (D)) upon the issue of the Convertible Securities with respect to which
such Options were actually exercised.

(E) No further adjustment in the Series B Conversion Price
shall be made upon the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities or shares of Common Stock
upon the exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities.

(F) In the case of any Options which expire by their terms not
more than thirty (30) days after the date of issue thereof, no adjustment of the Series B
Conversion Price shall be made until the expiration or exercise of all such Options, whereupon
such adjustment shall be made in the same manner provided in clause (D) above.

shares of Common Stock which are specifically excepted from the definition of Additional Stock
by subsection 4(d)(iii)(A) or (B)), or shall fix a record date for the determination of 1:olders of
any class of securities entitled to receive any such Options or Convertible Securities, then the
maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto

provide for either (1) any increase in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the
exercise, conversion or exchange of any such Option or Convertible Security or (2) any decrease

computed upon the original issue of such Option or Cor.vertible Security (or upon the occurrence
of a record date with respect theret~) shall be readjusted to such Series C Conversion Price as
would have been obtained had such revised terms been in effect upon the original date of
issuance of such Option or Convertible Security. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment
pursuant to this clause (B) shall have the effect of increasing the Series C Conversion Price to an
amount which exceeds the lower of (i) the Series C Conversion Price on the original adjustment
date, or (ii) the Series C Conversion Price that would have resulted from any issuances of
Additional Stock between the original adjustment date and such readjustment date.

the issuance of which did not result in an adjustment to the Series C Conversion Price pursuant
to the terms of subsection 4(d){i)(A) (either because the consideration per share (determined
pursuant to subsection 4(d){i(C) and (D) hereof) of the shares of Additional Stock subject
thereto was equal to or greater than the applicable Series C Conversion Price then in effect, or
because such Option or Convertible Security was issued before the Filing Date), are revised after

28
the Filing Date (either automatically pursuant to the provisions contained therein or as a result of
an amendment to such terms, but excluding automatic revisions of conversion ratios of any
Preferred Stock pursuant to the provisions cf the Preferred Stock existing on the Filing Date) to
provide for either (1) any increase in the num:ver of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the
exercise, conversion or exchange of any such Option or Convertible Security or (2) any decrease
in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion or exchange, then
such Option or Convertible Security, as so amended, ana the shares of Additional Stock subject

have ween issued effective upon such increase or decrease becoming effective.

(D) Upon the expiration or termination of any such Options or
any rights of conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have
been exerzised or converted, the Series C Conversion Price computed upon the original issue
thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto) and any subsequent
adjustments based thereon shall, upon such expiration or termination, be recomputed as if:

(1) _ in the case of Convertible Securities or Options for
Common Stock, the only shares of Additional Stock issued were the shares of Common Stock, if
any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities and the consideration received therefor was the consideration actually
received by the Corporation for the issue of all such Options, whether or not exercised, plus the
consideration actually received by the Corporation upon such exercise, or for the issue of all such
Convertible Securities which were actually converted or exchanged, plus the additional
consideration, if any, actually received by the Corporation upon such conversion or exchange,

only the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were issued at
the time of issue of such Options, and the consideration received by the Corporation for the
shares of Additional Stock deemed to have been then issued was the consideration actually
received by the Corporation for the issue of all such Options, whether or not exercised, plus the
consideration deemed to have been received by the Corporation (determined pursuant to
subsection 4(d){i)(C) and (D)) upon the issue of the Convertible Securities with respect to which
such Options were.actually exercised.

shall be made upon the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities or shares of Common Stock
upon the exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities.

more than thirty (30) days after the date of issue thereof, no adjustment of the Series C
Conversion Price shall be made until the expiration or exercise of all such Options, whereupon
such adjustment shall be made in the same manner provided in clause (D) above.

the Series C Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event as nearly equivalent as may be
practicable.

(i) No Impairment. The Corporation will not, by amendment of its Articles
of Incorporation or through any reorganization, recapitalization, transfer of assets, consolidation,
merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to
avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder

appropriate in order to protect the Series C Conversion Rights against impairment.

(j) No Fractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments.

(i) No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon
conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock. All shares of Common Stock (including fractions
thereof) issuable upon conversion of more than one share of Series C Preferred Stock by a holder
thereof shall be aggregated for purposes of dete: mining whether the conversicn would result in
the issuance of any fractional share. If, after the aforementioned aggregation, the conversion
would result in the-issuance of any fractional share, the Corporation shall, in lieu of issuing any
fractional share, pay cash equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by the Common
Stock’s fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation) on the date of conversion.

(ii) | Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the
Series C Conversion Price pursuant to this subsection 4, the Corporation, at its expense, shall
promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and
prepare and furnish to each holdei of Series C Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such
adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or
readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder
of Series C Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate
setting forth (A) such adjustment and readjustment, (B) the Series C Conversion Price at the time
in effect, and (C) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other

32
property which at the time would be received upon the conversion of a share of Series C
Preferred Stock.

(k) Notices of Record Date. In the event of any taking by the Corporation of a
record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof
who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend) or cther distribution, any
right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of stock of any class or any other
securities or property, or to receive any other right, the Corporation shall mail to each holder of
Series C Preferred Stock, at least 20 days prior to the date specified therein, a notice specifying
the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or
right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right.

(1) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at
all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock,

solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Series C Preferred Stock,
such number of its shares of Common Stock as shali from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding shares of the Series C Preferred Stock; and if at any time the
number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Series C Preferred Stock, in addition to such
other remedies as shall be available to the holder of such Preferred Stock, the Corporation will
take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient
for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite
shareholder approval of any necessary amendment to the Corporation’s Articles of Incorporation.

(m) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this subsection 4 to be
given to the holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall be deemed given if deposited in
the United States mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to each holder of record at his address
appearing on the books of the Corporation.

the right to one vote for each share of “ommon Stock into which such Series C Preferred Stock
could then be converted, and with respect to such vote, such holder shall have full voting rights
and powers equal to the voting rights and powers of the holders of Common Stock, and shall be
entitled, notwithstanding any provision hereof, to notice of any shareholders’ meeting in
accordance with the bylaws of the Corporation, and shall be entitled to vote, together with
holders of Common Stock, with respect to any question upon which holders of Common Stock
have the right to vote, except as may be otherwise provided by applicable law. Except as
otherwise expressly provided herein or as required by law, the holders of Series C Preferred
Stock and the holders of Common Stock shall vote together and not as separate classes.
Fractional votes shall not, however, be permitted and any fractional voting rights available on an
as-converted basis (after aggregating all shares into which shares of Series C Preferred Stock
held by each holder could be converted) shall be rounded to the nearest whole number (with one-
half being rounded upward).

6. Protective Provisions, So long as any shares of Series C Preferred Stock are
issued and outstanding, the Corporation shall not without first obtaining the approval (by vote or

33
written consent, as provided by law) of the holders of at least a majority of the then issued and
outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock:

(a) alter or change the rights, preferences or privileges of the shares of Series

the Original Series C Purchase Price.

7. Status of Converted Stock. In the event any shares of Series C Preferred Stock
shall be converted pursuant to subsection 4 hereof, the shares so converted shall be canceled and
shall not be issuable by the Corporation. The Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation shall
be appropriately amended to effect the corresponding reduction in the Corporation’s authorized
capital stock.

8. Repurchase of Shares. In connection with repurchases by the Corporation of its
Common Stock pursuant to repurchase rights contained in certain employment, option and other
similar agreements approved by the Board of Directors (under which the Corporation has the
option to repurchase shares of Common Stock from certain employees, officers, directors and
consultants upon the occurrence of certain events, such as termination of employment), Sections
502 and 503 of the California Corporations Code shall not apply in whole or in part with respect
to such repurchases.

the Series D-2 Preferred Stock and the Series D-3 Preferred Stockh. With respect to the
distribution of assets upon a Liquidation Event (as defined in Section IV.3(a)) or any
Extraordinary Transaction that is deemed to be a Liquidation Event pursuant to Section
IV.3(c)(i), the Series D-1! Preferred Stock shall rank senior to the Junior Stock and on a
parity with the Series D-2 Preferred Stock and the Series D-3 Preferred Stock.

2. Dividend Provisions.

(a) The holders of shares of Series D Preferred Stock shall be entitled
to receive cumulative dividends, out of any assets legally available therefor, prior and in
preference to any declaration or payment of any dividend (payable other than in Common
Stock or other securities and rights convertible into or entitling the holder thereof to
receive, directly or indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock of the Corporation) on
any Junior Stock of the Corporation, at the rate of $3.22545 per share per annum in the
case of the Series D-] Preferred Stock and Series D-2 Preferred Stock and at a rate of
$0.3232061 per share per annum in the case of the Series D-3 Preferred Stock (each as
adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations (excluding the
sale of Series D Preferred Stock) and the like with respect to such shares), which
dividends shall accrue daily in arrears from the date om which such share of Series D
Preferred Stock was issued and be compounded quarterly, whether or not such dividends
are declared by the Board of Directors or paid (the “Series D Dividends”). If the amount
of any dividends to be distributed among the holders of Series D Preferred Stock as
dividends pursuant to this subsection 2(a) is insufficient to permit the payment to the
holders of Series D Preferred Stock of all of the accrued but unpaid Series D Dividends,
then the funds of the Corporation available for distribution shall be distributed pro rata
among the holders of Series D Preferred Stock in proportion to the full Series D
Dividends to which each such holder is entitled.

(b) Unless the Series D Dividends (as set forth in Section 2(a)) shall
have been paid in full or declared and a sum sufficient for the full payment thereof set
apart: (i) no dividend whatsoever (other than a dividend payable solely in Common
Stock or other securities and rights convertible into or entitling the holder thereof to
receive, directly or indirectly, additional snares of Common Stock) shali be paid or
declared, and no distribution shall be made, on any Junior Stock, and (ii) no shares of
Junior Stock shall be purchased, redeemed, or acquired by the Corporation and no funds
shall be paid into or vet aside or made available for a sinking fund for the purchase,
redemption, or ‘acquisition thereof; provided, however, that this restriction shall not apply
to the repurchase of shares of Junior Stock that is unanimously approved by the Board of
Directors of the Corporation; and provided, further, that this restriction shall not apply to
the repurchase of shares of Common Stock held by employees, officers, directors and
consultants pursuant to any employn:ent, option or other similar agreement approved by
the Board of Directors under which the Corporation has the option to repurchase shares

35
of Common Stock upon the occurrence of certain events, such as termination of
employment.

(c) In addition to the Series D Dividends, the holders of Series D
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive dividends out of funds legally available
therefor at such times and in such amounts as the Board of Directors may determine in its
sole discretion; provided, however, that no such dividend may be declared or paid on any
shares of Series D Preferred Stock unless at the same time a dividend is declared or paid
on all outstanding shares of Common Stock, and vice versa, with holders of Series D
Preferred Stock sharing in such dividends as if they constituted a single class of stock,
and with each holder of shares of Series D Preferred Stock entitled to receive such
dividends based on the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of
Series D Preferred Stock are then convertible in accordance with subsection 4(a) below
(assuming for purposes of calculating such number, that all outstanding shares of Series
D-2 Preferred Stock had been first converted into shares of Series D-1 Preferred Stock in
accordance with Section VIII.4(a)). Nothing in this subsection 2(c) shall in any way
limit, impair or affect the rights of the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock to receive
the Series D Dividends and the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock shall be entitled to

paid on any outstanding shares of Common Stock.

or any Extraordinary Transaction that is deemed to be a Liquidation Event pursuant to
Section IV.3(c){i), the holders of Series D-1 Preferred Stock, Senes D-2 Preferred Stock
and Series D-3 Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive prior and in preference to any
distribution of any of the assets of the Corporation to the holders of any Junior Stock by
reason of their ownership thereof, an amount per share equal to the sum of (i) (A) in the
case of the Series D-1 Preferred Stock, $53.75751 (the “Original Series D-1 Issue
Price”), (B) in the case of the Series D-2 Preferred Stock, $53.75751 (the “Original
Series D-2 Issue Price”), and (C) in the case of the Series D-3 Preferred Stock,
$5.3867678 (the “Original Series D-3 Issue Price”) (in each case, as adjusted for any
stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations (excluding the sale of Series D
Preferred Stock) and the like with respect to such shares) and (ii) an amount equal to any
accrued but unpaid dividends on such share (subsections (i) and (ii) are collectively
referred to as the “Series D Base Amount”). If upon the occurrence of such event, the
assets and funds distributed among the holders of Series D Preferred Stock are
insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full Aggregate Series D Base
Amounts, then the entire assets and funds of the Corporation legally available for
distribution shall be distributed pro rata among the holders of Series D Preferred Stock in
proportion to the full Aggregate Series D Base Amounts to which each such holder is
entitled.

(vb) After the payment of the full Aggregate Series D Base Amounts as
set forth in subsection 3(a) above, the assets of the Corporation legally available for
distribution, if any, shall be distributed to the holders of Junior Preferred Stock pursuant

Common Stock held by each, determined on an as-if-converted basis (assuming
conversion of all such Series D Preferred Stock (including the conversion into Common
Stock of shares of Series D-1 Preferred Stock issuable upon conversion of shares of
Series D-2 Preferred Stock) into Common Stock pursuant to the terms hereof) (such
amount, together with the Aggregate Series D Base Amounts, the “Series D Preference
Amount”).

(c) In the event of an Extraordinary Transaction pursuant to Sections
IV.3(c)(i)(A)(2), IV.3(c)(i)(B), IV.3(c)(i)(C) or TV.3(c)(i)(D), if the Corporation does not
effect a dissolution of the Corporation within sixty (60) days after such Extraordinary
Transaction, then (i) the Corporation shall deliver a written notice to each holder of
Series D Preferred Stock no later than the 60" day after the Extraordinary Transaction
advising such holders of their right (and the requirements to be met to secure such right)
pursuant to the terms of the following clause (ii) to require the redemption of such shares
of Series D Preferred Stock, and (ii) if the holders of at least a majority of the voting
power of the then outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock so request in a written
instrument delivered to the Corporation not later than seventy-five (75) days after such
Extraordinary Transaction, the Corporation shall use the consideration received by the
Corporation in such Extraordinary Transaction (net of any liabilities associated with the
assets sold or technology licensed, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors
of the Corporation, and appropriations for reserves that the Board of Directors in good
faith may deem necessary for the payment of liabilities, obligations and expenses of the
Corporation), to the extent legally available therefor (the “Net Proceeds”), to redeem, on
the 90" day after such Company Sale (the “Liquidation Redemption Date”), all
outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock in accordance with the relative priorities

The provisions of subsections 6(c) thruugh 6(g) below shall apply, with such necessary
changes in the details thereof as are necessitated by the context, to the redemption of the
Series D Preferred Stock pursuant to this subsection 3(c). Prior to the disiribution or
redemption provided for in this subsection 3(c), the Corporation shall not expend or
dissipate the consideration received for such Extraordinary Transaction, except to
discharge expenses incurred in connection with such Extraordinary Transaction or
winding up of the Corporation’s business.

4. Conversion. The holders of the Series D-1 Preferred Stock shal! have
conversion rights as rollows (the “Series D-1 Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Series D-1 Preferred Stock shall
be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of
such share, at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for such stock, into such
number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by
dividing the applicable Series D Base Amount by the Series D-! Conversion Price (as

37
defined in this subsection 4(a)) in effect on the date that the certificate for such Series D-
1 Preferred Stock is surrendered for conversion. The conversion price per share of Series
D-1 Preferred Stock as of the Filing Date shall be $5.3867678 (the “Series D-1
Conversion Price”); provided, however, that the Series D-1 Conversion Price for the
Series D-1 Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in this subsection 4
after the Filing Date.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Series D-! Preferred Stock
shall automatically be converted into the number of shares of Common Stock determined
pursuant to subsection 4(a) above upon the earlier of (i) a QPO or (ii) the date specified
by written consent or agreement of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding
shares of Series D-1 Preferred Stock. Ifa closing of a QPO occurs, all outstanding shares
of Series D-1 Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have been converted into shares of
Common Stock immediately prior to such closing (the “Series D-1 QPO Conversion
Time”).

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Series D-1
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock, the
holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office
of the Corporation or of any cransfer agent for the Series D-1 Preferred Stock, and shall
give written notice to the Corporation at its principal corporate office, of the election to
convert the same and shall state therein the name or names in which the certificate or
certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued. The Corporation shall, as soon
as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver to such holder of Series D-1 Preferred Stock,
or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number
of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid and a
certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Series D-1] Preferred Stock, if any,
that were not converted by such holder. Subject to the last sentence of subsection 4(b)
above, such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the
close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Series D-1 Preferred Stock
to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common
Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder
or holders of such shares of Common Stock as of such date. If the conversion is in
connection with an underwritten offering of securities registered pursuant to the
Securities Act of 1933 (other than a QPO) or an Extraordinary Trans .iion, the
conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering Series D-1 Preferred Stock for
conversion, be conditioned upon the ciosing of such offering or Extraordinary
Transaction, in which event the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock upon
such conversion of the Series D-1 Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted
such Series D-1 Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such offering or
Extraordinary Transaction.

(d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Series D-1 Preferred Stock for
Certain Dilutive Issuances. The Series D-1 Conversion Price sha!l be subject to
adjustment from time to time as follows:

38
(i) (A) _ Ifthe Corporation shall issue, after the Filing Date,
any Additional Stock (as defined in subsection 4(d)(iii)(C)) without consideration or for a
consideration per share less than the Series D-3 Conversion Price (as defined in Section
IX.4(a)) in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock, the Series
D-1 Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall forthwith
(except as otherwise provided in this clause (d)) be adjusted to a price determined by
multiplying such Series D-1 Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall
be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such
issuance (assuming the conversion into Common Stock of all outstanding Series A
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred and Series C Preferred Stock and not including shares
issuable upon conversion of any other Convertible Securities (as defined in subsection
4(d)(iii)(B)) or any Options (as defined in subsection 4(d){iii)(A)), plus the number of
shares of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for
such issuance would purchase at such Series D-3 Conversion Price (as defined in Section
IX.4(a)) in effect immediately prior to such issuance of Additional Stock; and the
denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to such issuance (assuming the conversion into Common Stock of all
outstanding Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred and Series C Preferred Stock
and not including shares issuable upon conversion of any other Convertible Securities (as
defined in subsection 4(d)(iii)(B)) or any Options (as defined in subsection 4(d)(iii)(A)),
plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock.

(B) No adjustment of the Series D-1 Conversion Price
shall be made in an amount less than one cent per share, provided that any adjustments
which are not required to be made by reason of this sentence shall be carried forward and
shall be either taken into account in any subsequent adjustment made prior to 3 years
from the date the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward, or shall be
made at the end of 3 years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being
carried forward. Except to the limited extent provided for in subsection 4(d){ii)(D), no
adjustment of such Series D-1 Conversion Price pursuant to this subsection 4(d) shall
have the effect of increasing the Series D-1 Conversion Price above the Series D-!
Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment.

(C) Inthe case of the issuance of Common Stock for
cash, the consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before
deducting any discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the
Feporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale
thereof.

(D) Inthe case of the issuance of the Common Stock for
a consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall
be deemed to be the fair value thereof as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors of the Corporation.

39

(A) _ Ifthe Corporation at any time or from time to time
after the Filing Date shall issue any Options (as defined in subsection 4(d)(iii)(A)) or

Convertivle Securities which, upon exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, would
entitle the holder thereof to receive shares of Common Stock which are specifically
excepted from the definition of Additional Stock by subsection 4(d)(iii)(A) or (B)), or
shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to
receive any such Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of shares
of Common Stock (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto without regard to any
provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon
the exercise of such Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities and Options
therefor, the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to
be Additional Stock issued as of the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shall
have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date.

(B) _ Ifthe terms of any Option or Convertible Security,
the issuance of which resulted in an adjustment to the Series D-1 Conversion Price after
the Filing Date pursuant to the terms of subsection 4(d)(ii)(A) above, are revised (either
automatically pursuant the provisions contained therein or as a result of en amendment to
such terms) to provide for either (1) any increase in the number of shares of Common
Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any such Option or
Convertible Security or (2) any decrease in the consideration payable to the Corporation
upon such exercise, conversion or exchange, then, effective upon such increase or
decrease becoming effective, the Series D-1 Conversion Price computed upon the
original issue of such Option or Convertible Security (or upon the occurrence of a record
date with respect thereto) shall be readjusted to such Series D-1 Conversion Price as
would have been obtained had such revised terms been in effect upon the original date of
issuance of such Option or Convertible Security. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
adjustment pursuant to this clause (B) shall have the effect of increasing the Series D-1
Conversion Price to an amount which exceeds the lower of (i) the Series D-1 Conversion
Price on the original adjustment date, or (ii) the Series D-1 Conversion Price that would
have resulted from any issuances of Additional Stock between the original adjustment
date and such readjustment date.

(C) If the terms of any Option or Convertible Security
(excluding Options or Convertible Securities which, upon exercise, conversion or
exchange thereof, would entitle the holder thereof to receive shares of Common Stock
which are specifically excepted from the definition of Additional Stock in subsection
4(d)iii(A) or (B)), the issuance of which did not result in an adjustment to the Series D-
1 Conversion Price pursuant to the terms of subsection 4(d)(iA) (either because the
consideration per share (deterinined pursuant to subsection 4(d){i)(C) and (D) hereof) of
the shares of Additional Stock subject thereto was equal to or greater than the a,:plicable
Series D-! Conversion Price then in effect, or because such Option or Convertible
Security was issued before the Filing Date), are re .:sed after the Filing Date (either
automatically pursuant to the provisions contained therein or as a result of an amendment

40
to such terms, but excluding automatic revisions of conversion ratios of any Preferred
Stock pursuant to the provisions of the Preferred Stock existing on the Filing Date) to
provide for either (1) any increase in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable
upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any such Option or Convertible Security or
(2) any decrease in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon such exercise,
conversion or exchange, then such Option or Convertible Security, as so amended, and
the shares of Additional Stock subject thereto (determined in the manner provided in
subsection 4(d)(ii)(A) above) shall be deemed to have been issued effective upon such
increase cr decrease becoming effective.

(D) | Upon the expiration or termination of any such
Options or any rights of conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which
shall not have been exercised or converted, the Series D-1 Conversion Price computed
upon the original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect
thereto) and any subsequent adjustments based thereon shall, upon such expiration or
termination, be recomputed as if:

(1) in the case of Convertible Securities or
Options for Common Stock, the only shares of Additional Stock issued were the shares of
Common Stock, if any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities and the consideration received
therefor was the consideration actually received by the Corpcration for the issue of all
such Options, whether or not exercised, r'us the consideration actually received by the

were actually converted o: exchanged, plus the additional consideration, if any, actually
received by the Corporation upon such conversion or exchange, and

(2) in the case of Options for Convertible
Securities, only the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise
thereof were issued at the time of issue of such Options, and the consideration received
by the Corporation for the shares of Additional Stock deemed to have been then issued
was the consideration actually received by the Corporation for the issue of all such
Options, whether or not exercised, plus the consideration deemed to have been received
by the Corporation (determined pursuant to subsection 4(d)(i)(C) and (D)) upon the issue
of the Convertible Securities with respect to which such Options were actually exercised.

(E) No further adjustment in the Series D-1 Conversion
Price shall be made upon the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities or shares of
Common Stock upon the exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities.

(F) In the case of any Options which expire by their
terms not more than thirty (30) days after the date of issue thereof, no adjustment of the
Series D-1 Conversion Price shall be made until the expiration or exercise of all such
Options, whereupon such adjustment shall be made in the same manner provided in

decreased. If the Corporation shall at any time or from time to time after the Filing Date
combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Series D-1 Conversion Price in
effect immediately before that combination shall be proportionately increased. If the

such record date, by multiplying the Series D-! Conversion Price then in effect by a
fraction:

(i) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares

Filing Date shall make or issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of
Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in securities
of the Corporation (other than shares of Common Stock) or in cash or other property
(other than regular cash dividends paid out of earnings or earned surplus, determined in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles), then and in each such event
provision shall be made so that the holders of the Series D-1 Preferred Stock shall receive
upon conversion thereof in addition to the number of shares of Common Stock receivable
thereupon, the kind and amount of securities of the Corporation, cash or other property
which they wou!d have been entitled to receive had the Series D-1 Preferred Stock been
converted into Common Stock on the date of such event and had they thereafter, during
the period from the date of such event to and including the conversion date, retained such
securities receivable by them as aforesaid during such period, giving application to all

outstanding shares of Series D-1 Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock
on the date of such event.

(h) Recapitalizations, Reclassifications, Exchanges and Substitutions.
If at any time or from time to time, whether pursuant to a transaction with another entity

other change of the Common Stock (other than pursuant to a subdivision, combination or
merger or sale of assets transaction provided for elsewhere in subsection 3 or this

other change, to the end that the provisions of this subsection 4 (including adjustment of
the Series D-1 Conversion Price then in effect and the number of shares issuable upon
conversion of the Series D-1 Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event as
nearly equivalent as may be practicable.

(i) No Fractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments.

(i) No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon
conversion of the Series D-1 Preferred Stock. All shares of Common Stock (including
fractions thereof) issuable upon conversion of more than one share of Series D-1!
Preferred Stock by a holder thereof shall be aggregated for purposes of determining
whether the conversion would result in the issuance of any fractional share. If, after the
aforementioned aggregation, the conversion would result in the issuance of any factional
share, the Corporation shall, in lieu of issuing any fractional share, pay cash equal to the
product of such fraction multiplied by the Common Stock’s fair market value (as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation) on the date of
conversion.

the Series D-1 Conversion Price pursuant to this subsection 4, the Corporation, at its
expense, shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the
terms hereof and prepare and furnish to each holder of Series D-1 Preferred Stock a
certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts
upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon the
written request at any time of any holder of Series D-1 Preferred Stock, furnish or cause
to be furnished'to such holder a like certificate setting forth (A) such adjustment and

44
readjustment, (B) the Series D-1 Conversion Price at the time in effect, and (C) the
number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at
the time would be received upon the conversion of a share of Series D-1] Preferred Stock
(assuming for purposes of calculating such number, that all outstanding shares of Series
D-2 Preferred Stock had been first converted into shares of Series D-1 Preferred Stock in
accordance with Section VIII.4(a).

(j) Notices of Record Date. In the event of any taking by the
Corporation of a record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of
determining the holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a
cash dividend) or other distribution, any right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise
acquire any shares of stock of any class or any other securities or property, or to receive
any other right, the Corporation shall mail to each holder of Series D-1 Preferred Stock,

D-1 Preferred Stock (including any shares of D-1 Preferred Stock issuable upon the
conversion of all outstanding shares of Series D-2 Preferred Stock in accordance with
Section VIII.4(a)); and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of
Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding
shares of the Series D-1 Preferred Stock (including any shares of D-1 Preferred Stock
issuable upon the conversion of all outstanding shares of Series D-2 Preferred Stock in
accordance with Section VIII.4(a)), in addition to such other remedies as shall be
available to the holder of such Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate
action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but
unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for
such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the
requisite shareholder approval of any necessary amendment to the Corporation’s Articles
of Incorporation.

(1) Notices. Any notice required bv the provisions of this subsection 4

May 3, 2007, the holder(s) of at least a majority of the then outstanding shares of

Series D Preferred Stock may elect to have ail (but not less than all) of the outstanding
shares of Series D Preferred Stock redeemed. In such event, the Corporation shall

Stock redeemed pursuant to this subsection 5(a) and such election shall bind all holders
of Series D Preferred Stock. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
(i) each holder of shares of Series D-1 Preferred Stock shall have the right to elect to give

contained in this Section 5(a) with respect to the shares of Series D-1 Preferred Stock
held by such holder and (ii) each holder of shares of Series D-3 Preferred Stock shall
have the right to elect to give effect to the Series D-3 Conversion Rights instead of giving
effect to the provisions contained in this Section 5(a) with respect to the shares of Series
D-3 Preferred Stock held by such holder.

(b) Redemption Price. The price for each share of Series D Preferred
Stock redeemed pursuant to this Section 5 shall be an amount equal to the Series D

available to redeem shares of Series D Preferred Stock on the Series D Redemption Date

reasonably within its control, to remove promptly any impediments to its ability to
redeem the total number of shares of Series D Preferred Stock required to be so
redeemed, including, without limitation, (A) to the extent permissible under applicable
law, reducing the stated capital of the Corporation to create sufficient surplus to make
such redemption and (B) incurring any indebtedness necessary to make such redemption,
and (ii) in any event, use any funds that are legally available to redeem the maximum
possible number of such shares from the holders of such shares to be redeemed in
proportion to the respective number of such shares that otherwise would have been
redeemed if all such shares had been redeemed in full. At any time thereafter when
additional funds of the Corporation are legally available to redeem such shares of Series
D Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall immediately use such funds to redeem the
balance of the shares that the Corporation became obligated to redeem on the Series D
Redemption Date (but which it has not yet redeemed) at such Series D Redemption Price.

redeemed on the Series D Redemption Date for any reason, all such unredeemed shares

daily in arrears and to be compounded quarterly; provided, however, that in no event
shall such interest exceed the maximum permitted rate of interest under applicab!e law
(the “Maximum Permitted Rate”). In the event that fulfillment of any provision hereof
results in such rate of interest being in excess of the Maximum Permitted Rate, the
amount of interest required to be paid hereunder shal! automatically be reduced to
eliminate such excess; provided, however, that any subsequent increase in the Maximum
Permitted Rate shall be retroactively effective to the applicable Series D Redemption
Date to the extent permitted by law.

Preferred Stock are not redeemed on the Series D Redemption Date for any reason, the
number of Directors constituting the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall

of the holders of all other securities and classes of capital stock of the Corporation, shall
be entitled to elect the number of Directors prescribed in this Section 5(e), and each share
of Series D-1 Preferred Stock and Series D-3 Preferred Stock, voting together as a single

Directors of the Corporation at the time of a special meeting of the holders of Series D
Preferred Stock to elect such additional Directors shall continue, notwithstanding the
election at such meeting of the additional Directors that such holders are entitled to elect,

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Series D-3 Preferred Stock shall
be convertible, at the option of ine holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of
such share, at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for such stock, into such
number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by
dividing the applicable Series D Base Amount by the Series D-3 Conversion Price (as
defined in this subsection 4(a)) in effect on the date that the certificate for such Series D-

54
3 Preferred Stock is surrendered for conversion. The conversion price per share of Series
D-3 Preferred Stock as of the Filing Date shall be $5.3867678 (the “Series N-3
Conversion Price”); provided, however, that the Series D-3 Conversion Price for the
Series D-3 Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in this subsection 4
after the Filing Date.

(b) | Automatic Conversion. Each share of Series D-3 Preferred Stock
shall automatically be converted into the number of shares of Common Stock determined
pursuant to subsection 4(a) above upon the earlier of (i) a QPO or (ii) the date specified
by written consent or agreement of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding
shares of Series D-3 Preferred Stock. If a closing of a QPO occurs, all outstanning shares
of Series D-3 Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have been converted into shaics of
Common Stock immediately prior to such closing.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Series D-3
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock, the
holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office
of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for the Series D-3 Preferred Stock, and shall
give written notice to the Corporation at its principal corporate office, of the election to
convert the same and shall state therein the name or names in which the certificate or
certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued. The Corporation shall, as soon
as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver to such holder of Series D-3 Preferred Stock,
or to the nominee or ncininees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number
of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid and a
certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Series D-3 Preferred Stock, if any,

above, such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the
close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Series D-3 Preferred Stock
to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common
Stock issuable upon such conversion shali be treated for all purposes as the record holder
or holders of such shares of Common Stock as of such date. If the conversion is in
connection with an underwritten offering of securities registered pursuant to the
Securities Act of 1933 (other than a QPO) or an Extraordinary Transaction, the
conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering Series D-3 Preferred Stock for
conversion, be conditioned upon the closing of such offering or Extraordinary
Transaction, in which event the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock upon
such conversion of the Series D-3 Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted
such Series D-3 Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of sach offering or
Extraordinary Transaction.

(d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Series D-3 Preferred Stock for

Certain Dilutive Issuances. The Series D-3 Conversion Price shall be subject to
adjustment from time to time as follows:

(i) (A) _ Ifthe Corporation shall issue, after the Filing Date,
any Additional Stock (as defined in subsection 4(d\iii)(C)) without consideration or for a
consideration per share less than the Series D-3 Conversion Price in effect immediately

55
prior to the issuance of such Additionai Stock, the Series D-3 Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to each such issuance shall forthwith (except as otherwise provided in
this clause (d}) be adjusted to a price determined by multiplying such Series D-3
Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance (assuming the conversion
into Common Stock of all outstanding Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred and
Series C Preferred Stock and not including shares issuable upon conversion of any other
Convertible Securities (as defined in subsection 4(d)(iii)(B)) or any Options (as defined
in subsection 4(d)(iii)(A)), plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the
aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for such issuance would purchase at
such Series D-3 Conversion Price in effect immediateiy prior to such issuance of
Additional Stock; and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance (assuming the conversion
into Common Stock of all outstanding Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred and
Series C Preferred Stock and not including shares issuable upon conversion of any other
Convertible Securities (as defined in subsection 4(d)(iii)(B)) or any Options (as defined
in subsection 4(d)(iii)(A)), plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock.

(B) No adjustment of the Series D-3 Conversion Price
shall be made in an amount less than one cent per share, provided that any adjustments
which are not required to be made by reason of this sentence shall be carried forward and
shall be vither taken into account in any subsequent adjustment made prior to 3 years
from the date the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward, or shall be
made at the end of 3 years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being
carried forward. Except to the limited extent provided for in subsection 4(d)(ii)(D), no
adjustment of such Series D-3 Conversion Price pursuant to this subsection 4(d) shall
have the effect of increasing the Series D-3 Conversion Price above the Series D-3
Conversion Price in effect immediatels prior to such adjustment.

(C) inthe case of the issuance of Common Stock for
cash, the consideration shall be dee a¢ j to be the amount of cash paid therefor before
deducting any discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the
Corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale
thereof.

(D) Inthe case of the issuance of the Common Stock for
a consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall
be deemed to be the fair value thereof as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors of the Corporation.

(ii) Issue of Securities Deemed Issue of Additional Stock.

(A) _ Ifthe Corporation at any time or from time to time
after the Filing Date shal! issue any Options (as defined in subsection 4(d)(iii)(A;) or
Convertible Securities (as defined in subsection 4(d)(iii/B)) (excluding Options or
Convertible Securities which, upon exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, would
entitle the holder thereof to receive shares of Common Stock which are specifically

56
excepted from the definition of Additional Stock by subsection 4(d)(iii)(A) or (B)), or
shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled tc
receive any such Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of shares
of Common Stock (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto without regard to any
provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon
the exercisc of such Options or, in the case of Convertibie Securities and Options
therefor, the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to
be Additional Stock issued as of the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shall
have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date.

(B) Ifthe terms of any Option or Convertible Security,
the issuance of which resulted in an adjustment to the Series D-3 Conversion Price after
the Filing Date pursuant to the terms of subsection 4(d){ii)(A) above, are revised (either
automatically pursuant the provisions contained therein or as a result of an amendment to
such terms) to provide for either (1) any increase in the number of shares of Common
Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any such Option or
Convertible Security or (2) any decrease in the consideration payable to the Corporation
upon such exercise, conversion or exchange, then, effective upon such increase or
decrease becoming effective, the Series D-3 Conversion Price computed upon the
original issue of such Option or Convertible Security (or upon the occurrence of a record
date with respect thereto) shall be readjusted to such Series D-3 Conversion Price as
would have been obtained had such revised terms been in effect upon the original date of
issuance of such Option or Convertible Security. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
adjustment pursuant to this clause (B) shall have the effect of increasing the Series D-?
Conversion Price to an amount which exceeds the lower of (i) the Series D-3 Conversion
Price on the original adjustment date, or (ii) the Series D-3 Conversion Price that would
have resulted from any issuances of Additional Stock between the original adjustment
date and such readjustment date.

(C) If the terms of any Option or Convertible Security
(excluding Options or Convertible Securities which, upon exercise, conversion or
exchange thereof, would entitle the holder thereof to receive shares of Common Stock
which are specifically excepted from the definition of Additional Stock in subsection
4(d)(iii}(A) or (B)), the issuance of which did not result in an adjustment to the Series D-
3 Conversion Price pursuant to the terms of subsection 4(d){i){A) (either because the
consideration per share (determined pursuant to subsection 4(d){i)(C) and (D) hereof) of
the shares of Additional Stock subject thereto was equal to or greater than the applicable
Series D-3 Conversion Price then in effect, or because such Option or Convertible
Security was issued before the Filing Date), are revised after the Filing Date (either
automatically pursuant to the provisions contained therein or as a result of an amendment
to such terms, but excluding automatic revisions of conversion ratios of any Preferred
Stock pursuant to the provisions of the Preferred Stock existing on the Filing Date) to
provide for either (1) any increase in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable
upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any such Option or Convertible Security or
(2) any decreace in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon such exercise,
conversion or exchange, then such Option or Convertible Security, as so amended, and
the shares of Additional Stock subject thereto (determined in the manner provided in

57
subsection 4(d)(ii)(A) above) shall be deemed to have been issued effective upon such
increase or decrease becoming effective.

(D) Upon the expiration or termination of any such
Options or any rights of conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities ‘which
shall not have been exercised or converted, the Series D-3 Conversion Price compuied
upon the original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect
thereto) and any subsequent adjustments based thereon shall, upon such expiration or
termination, be recomputed as if:

(1) in the case of Convertible Securities or
Options for Common Stock, the only shares of Additional Stock issued were the shares of
Common Stock, if any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities and the consideration received
therefor was the consideration actually received by the Corporation for the issue of all
such Options, whether or not exercised, plus the consideration actually received by the
Corporation upon such exercise, or for the issue of all such Convertible Securities which
were actually converted or exchanged, plus the additional consideration, if any, actually
received by the Corporation upon such conversion or exchange, and

(2) in the case of Options for Convertible
Securities, only the Convertible Securities, if ary, actually issued upon the exercise
thereof were issued at the time of issue of such Options, and the consideration received
by the Corporation for the shares of Additional Stock deemed to have been then issued
was the consideration actually received by the Corporation for the issue of all such
Options, whether or not exercised, plus the consideration deemed to have been received
by the Corporation (determined pursuant to subsection 4(d)(i)(C) and (D)) upon the issue
of the Convertible Securities with respect to which such Options were actually exercised.

(E) No further adjustment in the Series D-3 Conversion
Price shall be made upon the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities or shares of
Common Stock upon the exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities.

(F) In the case of any Options which expire by their
terms not more than thirty (30) days after the date of issue thereof, no adjustment of the
Series D-3 Conversion Price shall be made until the expiration or exercise of all such
Options, whereupon such adjustment shall be made in the same manner provided in
clause (D) above.

Combinations. If the Corporation shall at any time or from time to time after the Filing

Date effect a subdivision of the outstanding Common Stock, the Series D-3 Conversion
Price in effect immediately before that subdivision shall be proportionately decreased. If

outstanding shares of Series D-3 Preferred Stock without making a corresponding
combination of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Serius C Preferred
Stock, Series D-1 Preferred Stock and Series D-2 Preferred Stock, then the Series D-3
Conversion Price in effect immediately before that combina:ion shall be proportionately
decreased. If the Corporation shall at any time or from time to time after the Filing Date
combine the outstanding shares of Common Stcck, the Series D-3 Conversion Price in
effect immediately before that combination shall be proportionately increased. If the
Corporation shall at anv time or from time to time after the Filing Date effect a
subdivision of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock without effecting a
corresponding subdivision of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock,
Series C Preferred Stock, Series D-1 Preferred Stock and Series D-2 Preferred Stock, the
Series D-3 Cor:version Price in effect immediately before that subdivision shall be
proportionately increased. Any adjustment under this paragraph shall become effective at

Filing Date shal! make or issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of
Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in additional
shares of Common Stock, then and in each such event the Series D-3 Conversion Price in

59
effect immediately before such event shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance
or, in the event such a record date shall have been fixed, as of th:e close of business on
such record date, by multiplying the Series D-3 Conversion Price then in effect by a
fractior’

(i) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares
of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance
or the close of business on such record date, and

(ii) | the denominator of which shall be the total number of
shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such
issuance or the close of business on such record date plus the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution; provided, however,
if such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend is not fully paid or if such
distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the Series D-3 Conversion Price
shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record date and
thereafter the Series D-3 Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this paragraph as
of the time of actual payment of such dividends or distributions; and provided further,
however, that no such adjustment shall be made if the holders of Series D-3 Preferred
Stock simultaneously receive (i) a dividend or other distribution of shares of Common
Stock in a number equal to the number of shares of Common Stock as they would have
received if all outstanding shares of Series D-3 Preferred Stock had been converted into
Common Stock on the date of such event or (ii) a dividend or other distribution of shares
of Series D-3 Preferred Stock which are convertible, as of the date of such event, into
such number of shares of Common Stock as is equal to the number of shares of Common
Stock as they would have received if all outstanding shares of Series D-3 Preferred Stock
had been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event.

(g) | Adjustments to Series D-3 Preferred Stock for Other Divicends
and Distributions. In the event the Corporaticn at any time or from time to time after the
Filing Date shall make or issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of
Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in securities
of the Corporation (other than shares of Common Stock) or in cash or other property
(other than regular cash dividends paid out of earnings or earned surplus, determined in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles), then and in each such event
provision shall be made so that the holders of the Series D-3 Preferred Stock shall receive
upon conversion thereof in addition to the number of shares of Common Stock receivable
thereupon, the kind and amount of securities of the Corporation, cash or other property
which they would have been entitled to receive had the Series D-3 Preferred Stock been
converted into Common Stock on the date of such event and had they thereafter, during
the period from the date of such event to and including the conversion date, retained such
securities receivable by them as aforesaid during such period, giving application to all
adjustments called for during such period under this paragraph with respect to the rights
of the holders of the Series D-3 Preferred Stock; provided that no such adjustment shall
be made if the holders of Series D-3 Preferred Stock simultaneously receive a dividend or
other distribution of such securities, cash, or other property in an amount equal to the
amount of such s<curities, cash, or other property as they would have received if al!

60
outstanding shares of Series D-3 Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock
on the date of such event.

(h)  Recapitalizations, Reclassifications, Exchanges and Substitutions.
If at any time or from time to time, whether pursuant to a transaction with another entity

other change of the Common Stock (other than pursuant to a subdivision, combination or
merger or sale of assets transaction provided for elsewhere in subsection 3 or this
subsection 4), provision shall be made so that the holders of the Series D-3 Preferred
Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of the Series D-3 Preferred
Stock the kind and amount of stock or other securities or property to which a holder of
the Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of the Series D-3 Preferred Stock would
have been entitled on the recapitalization, reclassification, exchange, substitution or other
change. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the
provisions of this subsection 4 with respect to the rights of the holders of the Series D-3
Preferred Stock after such recapitalization, reclassification, exchange, substitution or
other change, to the end that the provisions of this subsection 4 (including adjustment of
the Series D-3 Conversion Price then in effect and the number of shares issuable upon
conversion of the Series D-3 Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event as
nearly equivalent as may be practicable.

(i) No Fractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments.

(i) No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon
conversion of the Series D-3 Preferred Stock. All shares of Common Stock (including
fractions thereof) issuable upon conversion of more than one share of Series D-3
Preferred Stock by a holder thereof shall b> aggregated for purposes of determining
whether the conversion would result in the issuance of any fractional share. If, after the
aforementioned aggregation, the conversion would result in the issuance of any fractional
share, the Corporation shall, in lieu of issuing any fractional share, pay cash equal to the
product of such fraction multiplied by the Common Stock’s fair market value (as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation) on the date of
conversion.

(ii) | Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of
the Series D-3 Conversion Price pursuant to this subsection 4, the Corporution, at its

to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (A) such adjustment and
readjustment, (B) the Series D-3 Conversion Price at the time in effect, and (C) the
number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at
the time would be received upon the conversion of a share of Series D-3 Preferred Stock.

Corporation of a record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of
determining the holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a
cash dividend) or other distribution, any right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise
acquire any shares of stock of any class or any other securities or property, or to receive
any other right, the Corporation shall mail to each holder of Series D-3 Preferred Stock,
at least 20 days prior to the date specified therein, a notice specifying the date on which

Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the
Series D-3 Preferred Stock, such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from
time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of al! outstanding shares of the Series
D-3 Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of
Common Stock shall not be sufficient iv effect the conversion of all then outstanding
shares of the Series D-3 Preferred Stock, in addition to such other remedies as shall be
available to the holder of such Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate
action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but
unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for
such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the
requisite shareholder approval of any necessary amendment to the Corporation’s Articles
