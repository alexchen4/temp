Preferred Stock will continue to be outstanding on the same terms and conditions as set forth

restrictions on free marketability covered by (B) below:

the Board of Directors of the Corporation in the good faith exercise of their reasonable business
judgment; provided that, if the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding Voting Preferred
Stock (voting on an as-converted basis) object to such valuation, then the value shall be the fair
market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Corporation and the holders of not less than
a majority of the outstanding shares of Voting Preferred Stock; and, provided further, that, if the
Board of Directors of the Corporation and the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding
shares of Voting Preferred Stock are unable to reach an agreement, then by independent
appraisal by an investment bank hired and paid by the Corporation, but reasonably acceptable to
the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Voting Preferred Stock, voting
together as a single class.

(B) The method of valuation of securities subject to investment letter
or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of a
shareholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount
from the fair market value determined as above in (A) (1), (2) or (3) to reflect the approximate
fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Corporation and the holders of not less
than a majority of the outstanding shares of Voting Preferred Stock, voting together as a single
class; and, provided further, that, if the Corporation and the holders of at least a majority of the

payable to the stockholders of the Corporation is placed into escrow and/or is payable to the
stockholders of the Corporation subject to the achievement of future milestones or similar

such consideration that is not placed into escrow and not subject to the achievement of future
milestones or similar contingencies (the “Initial Consideration’) shall be allocated among the
holders of capital stock of the Corporation in accordance with Section J(a) as if the Initial
Consideration were the only consideration payable in connection with such Deemed Liquidation
Event and (ii) any additional consideration that becomes payable to the stockholders of the
Corporation upon release from escrow or the achievement of milestones or similar contingencies
shall be allocated among the holders of capital stock of the Corporation in accordance with
Section I(a) after taking into account all previous payments of consideration as part of the same
transaction

(f) In the event of a Deemed Liquidation Event referred to in Section I(c)(2), if the
Corporation does not effect a dissolution of the Corporation under the DGCL within 90 days
after such Deemed Liquidation Event, then (i) the Corporation shall send a written notice to each
holder of Preferred Stock no later than the 90th day after the Deemed Liquidation Event advising
such holder of such holder’s right (and the requirements to be met to secure such right) pursuant
to the terms of the following clause (ii) to require the redemption of such shares of Preferred
Stock, and (iii) if the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding shares of Voting
Preferred Stock (voting on an as-converted basis) so request in a written instrument delivered to
the Corporation not later than 120 days after such Deemed Liquidation Event, the Corporation
shall use the consideration received by the Corporation for such Deemed Liquidation Event (net

good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation), together with any other assets of the
Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders (the “Available Proceeds’), to the
extent legally available therefor, on the 150th day after such Deemed Liquidation Event, to
redeem all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock at a price per share equal to the amounts that
would have been payable pursuant to Section I(a). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
of a redemption pursuant to the preceding sentence, if the Available Proceeds are not sufficient
to redeem all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall first redeem a portion
of shares of Preferred Stock in accordance with the liquidation preferences set forth in Section
I(a) and to the fullest extent of such Available Proceeds, and shall redeem the remaining shares
to have been redeemed as soon as practicable after the Corporation has funds legally available
therefor. Prior to the distribution or redemption provided for in this Section I(f), the Corporation
shall not expend or dissipate the consideration received for such Deemed Liquidation Event,

Closing Notice” with respect to a Second Closing to be consummated pursuant to in accordance
with all of the requirements of the Purchase Agreement; and

(B) _ the Corporation does not receive from any such holder (either
alone or together with such holder’s Affiliated Group of Holders (as defined below)) which are
accredited investors, as defined in Regulation D under the Securities Act, on or prior to such
Second Closing the full amount of such holder’s required investment amount as set forth in such
Second Closing Notice;

then, notwithstanding any other provision of this Certificate of Incorporation, each share of the
then outstanding Series C Preferred Stock held by such holder and the other members of such
holder’s Affiliated Group of Holders as of the delivery of the Second Closing Notice shall,
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into shares
of Common Stock at a ratio of one share of Common Stock for every ten shares of Series C
Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any Recapitalization Events), effective as of the completion of
such Second Closing, and all rights of such holder(s) of such shares as a holder of Series C
Preferred Stock shall immediately upon such Second Closing cease and terminate with respect to
the shares so converted (including without limitation any rights to declared but unpaid dividends
or by reason of antidilution adjustments made prior to the Second Closing, which shall be
forfeited immediately upon the Second Closing). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
Section III(a), no holder of Series C Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert its shares of
Series C Preferred Stock into Common Stock between the date that a Second Closing Notice is
delivered to such holder and the date that the Second Closing is held.

As used herein, “Affiliated Group of Holders” means a holder of Series C Preferred Stock,
together with each of its affiliates, with “affiliates,” for purposes of this sentence, having the
same meaning as set forth in Rule 405 of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the

11
Securities Act and, in the case of a venture capital fund shall include any other funds under
common management with such fund.

(iii) In the event that any holder of Series C Preferred Stock (either alone or
together with such holder’s Affiliated Group of Holders) fails to purchase from the Corporation
such holder’s pro rata share (based on the number of shares of Preferred Stock owned by such
holder relative to the number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding) of any Applicable
Financing Securities (as defined below) issued and sold in an Applicable Financing (as defined
below) (such holder and each member of such holder’s Affiliated Group of Holders being
referred to herein as a “Nonparticipating Series C Holder’) then, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Certificate of Incorporation, each share of the then outstanding Preferred Stock
held by each Nonparticipating Series C Holder as of the initial closing of the Applicable
Financing (as defined below) shall, automatically and without any action on the part of such
Nonparticipating Holder, be converted into shares of Common Stock at a ratio of one share of
Common Stock for every one share of Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any Recapitalization
Events), effective as of the initial closing of such Applicable Financing, and ail rights of each
Nonparticipating Series C Holder as a holder of Preferred Stock shall immediately upon such
initial closing cease and terminate with respect to the shares so converted (including without
limitation any rights to declared but unpaid dividends or by reason of antidilution adjustments
made prior to such Applicable Financing, which shall be forfeited immediately upon the initial
closing thereof). The provisions of this Section 3(d)(il1) may be waived by the holders of at least
a majority of the then outstanding Voting Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, As used
herein, “Applicable Financing Securities” means any shares of capital stock of the Corporation
or any debt securities of the Corporation convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital
stock of the Corporation and “Applicable Financing” means a financing of the Corporation
consummated at any time after July 18, 2012 in which new cash is raised from investors through
the issuance and sale of Applicable Financing Securities, whether or not such investors are then
holders of any debt or equity securities of the Corporation, except for (i) the consummation of
the Second Closing under the Purchase Agreement; (ii) any financing involving the issuance and
sale of shares of capital stock at an effective per-share price that is greater than the Original
Issuance Price for a share of Series C Preferred Stock (as adjusted for Recapitalization Events)
and (iii) any financing involving the issuance and sale of debt securities that are, as of the date of
issuance, convertible into or exchangeable for a predetermined class or series of shares of capital
stock of the Corporation at a fixed per-share conversion or exchange price (as opposed to, for
example, being convertible into or exchangeable for securities that are to be authorized and at a
price to be fixed in connection with a future financing) that is greater than the Original Issuance
Price for a share of Series C Preferred Stock (as adjusted for Recapitalization Events).

(e) Neo fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of the
Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would otherwise be entitled,
the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the then effective applicable
Conversion Price.

(f) Upon the occurrence of an event specified in Section III(d), the Preferred Stock
shall be converted automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and
whether or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its

12
transfer agent for the Preferred Stock; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be
obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such
conversion unless certificates evidencing such shares of the Preferred Stock being converted are
either delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent, or the holder notifies the Corporation or
its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen, or destroyed and executes an
agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred
by it in connection therewith and, if the Corporation so elects, provides an appropriate indemnity
bond. Upon the automatic conversion of the Preferred Stock pursuant to Section III(d), the
holders of such Preferred Stock shall surrender the certificates representing such shares at the
office of the Corporation or of its transfer agent. Thereupon, there shall be issued and delivered
to such holder, promptly at such office and in his name as shown on such surrendered certificate
or certificates, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which
the shares of the Preferred Stock surrendered were convertible on the date on which such
automatic conversion occurred. From and after the date of the event that causes the automatic
conversion, all rights of the holder with respect to the Preferred Stock so converted shall
terminate, except only the right of such holder, upon the surrender of such holder’s certificate or
certificates therefor, to receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock issuable
upon conversion thereof.

(g) Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into full
shares of Common Stock (except as provided in Section III(d)), such holder shall surrender the
certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of its transfer
agent for the Preferred Stock and shall give written notice to the Corporation at such office that
the holder elects to convert the same and shall state therein the holder’s name or the name or
names of the holder’s nominee in which the holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares
of Common Stock to be issued. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue
and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to the holder’s nominee, a
certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which the holder shall be
entitled as aforesaid, together with cash in lieu of any fraction of a share. Except as set forth in
Section IJ(d)(i1), such conversion shall be deemed to have been made on the date of such
surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted and notice as herein provided, and the
person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion shall
be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on
such date or, if such date is a weekend or legal holiday, the next succeeding business day. From
and after such date, all rights of the holder with respect to the Preferred Stock so converted shall
terminate.

2 Preferred Stock issued by the Corporation on December 30, 2009, as amended from time to

after July 18, 2012 shall issue any Options or Convertible Securities or shall fix a record date for
the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive any such Options or
Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of shares (as set forth in the instrument
relating thereto without regard to any provisions contained therein for a subsequent adjustment
of such number) of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case of
Convertible Securities and Options therefor, the exercise of such Options and conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to be Additional Shares of Common

14
Stock issued as of the time of such issue of such Options or Convertible Securities or, in case
such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, provided
that Additional Shares of Common Stock shall not be deemed to have been issued unless the
consideration per share (determined pursuant to Section III(h)(iv)) of such Additional Shares of
Common Stock would be less than the Conversion Price with respect to the Voting Preferred
Stock in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such issue, or such record date, as the case
may be, and provided further that in any such case in which Additional Shares of Common Stock
are deemed to be issued:

(A) _ no further adjustment in the Conversion Price shall be made upon
the subsequent issue of Options or Convertible Securities or shares of Common Stock upon the
exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities;

(B) if such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms provide,
with the passage of time or otherwise, for any increase or decrease in the consideration payable
to the Corporation, or increase or decrease in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable,
upon the exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, the Conversion Price computed upon the
original issuance thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and any
subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon any such increase or decrease becoming
effective, be recomputed to reflect such increase or decrease insofar as it affects the rights of
exercise under such Options or the rights of conversion or exchange under such Convertible
Securities;

(C) upon the expiration of any such Options or any rights of
conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities that shall not have been exercised, the
Conversion Price computed upon the original issuance thereof (or upon the occurrence of a
record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon
such expiration, be recomputed as if:

(i) in the case of Options or Convertible Securities, the
only Additional Shares of Common Stock issued were the shares of Common Stock, if any,
actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities and the consideration received therefor was the consideration actually
received by the Corporation for the issue of all such Options, plus the consideration actually
received by the Corporation upon such exercise, or the consideration actually received by the
Corporation for the issue of all such Convertible Securities that were actually converted or
exchanged, plus the additional consideration, if any, actually received by the Corporation upon
such conversion or exchange; and

(ii) in the case of Options for Convertible Securities,
only the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were issued at
the time of issue of such Options, and the consideration received by the Corporation for the
Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been then issued was the consideration
actually received by the Corporation for the issue of all such Options, whether or not exercised,
plus the consideration deemed to have been received by the Corporation (determined pursuant to
Section IIT(h)(iv)) upon the issue of the Convertible Securities with respect to which such
Options were actually exercised;

15
(D) no readjustment pursuant to clause (B) or (C) above shall have the
effect of increasing the Conversion Price to an amount that exceeds the lower of (i) such
Conversion Price on the original adjustment date, or (ii) the Conversion Price that would have
resulted from any actual issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock between the original
adjustment date and such readjustment date;

(E) _ inthe case of any Options that expire by their terms not more than
30 days after the date of issue thereof, no adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made until
the expiration or exercise of all such Options, whereupon such adjustment shall be made in the
same manner provided in clause (C) above; and

(F) — if such record date shall have been fixed and such Options or
Convertible Securities are not issued on the date fixed therefor, the adjustment previously made
in the Conversion Price that became effective on such record date shall be canceled as of the
Close of business on such record date, and thereafter the Conversion Price shall be adjusted
pursuant to this Section I[I(h)(ii) as of the actual date of their issuance.

(2) In the event the Corporation at any time or from time to time after
July 18, 2012 shall declare or pay any dividend or make any other distribution on the Common
Stock payable in Common Stock or effect a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common
Stock (by reclassification or otherwise other than by payment of a dividend in Common Stock),
then and in any such event, Additional Shares of Common Stock shall be deemed to have been
issued:

(A) in the case of any such dividend or distribution, immediately after
the close of business on the record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities
entitled to receive such dividend or distribution, or

(B) _ inthe case of any such subdivision, when such corporate action
becomes effective.

If such record date shall have been fixed and no part of such dividend or distribution shall have
been paid or made on the date fixed therefor, the adjustment previously made in the Conversion
Price that became effective on such record date shall be canceled as of the close of business on
such record date, and thereafter the Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this

Section ITI(h)(ii) as of the time of actual payment of such dividend or making of such
distribution.

(iii) In the event the Corporation shall issue Additional Shares of Common
Stock (including, without limitation, Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued
pursuant to Section IfI(h)(ii)), without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the
Conversion Price for the Voting Preferred Stock in effect on the date of and immediately prior to
such issuance (a “Dilutive Issuance”), then and in such event, the Conversion Price for the
Voting Preferred Stock (but not the Conversion Price for the Series A-2 Preferred Stock, which
shall in no event be adjusted in connection with a Dilutive Issuance) shall be reduced,
concurrently with such Dilutive Issuance, to a price (calculated to the nearest tenth of a cent)
determined by multiplying such Conversion Price for the Voting Preferred Stock by a fraction,

16
the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to such Dilutive Issuance plus the number of shares of Common Stock which
the aggregate consideration received or deemed to have been received by the Corporation for the
total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued or deemed to be issued would
purchase at such Conversion Price and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares
of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Dilutive Issuance plus the number of
such Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued or deemed to be issued. For the purpose of
this Section HI(h){iti), all shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of shares of
Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to a Dilutive Issuance and the exercise and/or
conversion of any other outstanding Convertible Securities (excluding convertible debt with no
fixed conversion price) and all outstanding Options shall be deemed to be outstanding.

(iv) For purposes of this Section III(h), the consideration received by the
Corporation for the issue of any Additional Shares of Common Stock shall be computed as
follows:

(1) — Such consideration shall:

(A) _ insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the aggregate
amounts of cash received by the Corporation excluding amounts paid or payable for accrued.
interest or accrued dividends;

(B) _ insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be computed at
the fair value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors of the Corporation; and

(C) in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock are issued
together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for consideration that
covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in
clauses (A) and (B) above, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation.

(2) The consideration per share received by the Corporation for
Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued pursuant to Section
III(h)Gi)(1), relating to Options and Convertible Securities, shall be determined by dividing
(A) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Corporation as consideration for the
issuance of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of
additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any
provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration) payable to the
Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such
Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, by (B) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set forth in the
instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent
adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities.

17
(v) (1) Inthe event the Corporation shall issue Additional Shares of
Common Stock pursuant to Section II(h){ii)(2) in a stock dividend, stock distribution or
subdivision, such Additional Shares of Common Stock shall be deemed to have been issued for
no consideration.

(2) In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be
combined or consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of
Common Stock, the applicable Conversion Price with respect to each series of Preferred Stock in
effect immediately prior to such combination or consolidation shall, concurrently with the
effectiveness of such combination or consolidation, be proportionately increased.

(vi) | No adjustment in the number of shares of Common Stock into which the
Preferred Stock is convertible shall be made, by adjustment in the Conversion Price in respect of
the issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock, unless the consideration per share for an
Additional Share of Common Stock issued or deemed to be issued by the Corporation is less than
the applicable Conversion Price in effect on the date of, and immediately prior to, the issuance of
such Additional Share.

(vit) Ifat any time or from time to time there shall be a recapitalization of the
Common Stock (but not the Preferred Stock) (other than a transaction provided for elsewhere in
this Section III or in Section I), provision shall be made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock
shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of the Preferred Stock the number of
shares of stock or other securities or property of the Corporation or otherwise, to which a holder
of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled on such
recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the
provisions of this Section III with respect to the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock after
the recapitalization to the end that the provisions of this Section III (including adjustment of the
Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock then in effect and the number of shares
purchasable upon conversion of each series of Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that
event as nearly equivalent as shall be reasonably practicable.

(viii) The provisions of this Section II](h) may be waived as to the Series A-1
Preferred Stock upon the vote or written consent of the holders of a majority of the voting power
of such Series A-1 Preferred Stock; the provisions of this Section II(h) may be waived as to the
Series B Preferred Stock upon the vote or written consent of the holders of a majority of the
voting power of such Series B Preferred Stock; and the provisions of this Section JII(h) may be
waived as to the Series C Preferred Stock by the Requisite Series C Holders.

(i) Except for an amendment approved in accordance with Section II, the
Corporation shall not, by amendment of this Certificate of Incorporation or through any
reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issuance or sale of securities
or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the
terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Corporation but shall at all times in good
faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Section III and in the taking of all such
action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holders
of the Preferred Stock set forth herein against impairment.

18
(j) Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the Conversion Price
pursuant to this Section III, the Corporation at its expense shal! promptly compute such
adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to each holder of the
affected series of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and
showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The
Corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock, furnish
or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and
readjustments, (ii) the Conversion Price at the time in effect, and (iii) the number of shares of
Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received
upon the conversion of each share of Preferred Stock.

(k) In the event of any taking by the Corporation of a record of the holders of any
class or series of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof who are entitled to _
receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend that is the same as cash dividends paid in
previous quarters) or other distribution, the Corporation shall mail to each holder of each series
of Preferred Stock that is convertible into Common Stock, at least 10 days prior to such record
date, a notice specifying the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such
dividend or distribution.

(1) The Corporation shall reserve and keep available out of its authorized but
unissued Common Stock such number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be
sufficient to effect conversion of the Preferred Stock.

(m) The Corporation shall pay any issue or transfer taxes payable in connection with
the conversion of the Preferred Stock into Common Stock, provided, however, that the
Corporation shall not be required to pay any tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer to
a name other than that of the holder of the Preferred Stock, and no issuance or delivery need be
made unless the Corporation has been paid the amount of such tax or it has been established to
the Corporation’s satisfaction that the tax has been paid.

IV. Dividends.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section IV or in a certificate of designations
filed pursuant to the DGCL with respect to any series of Preferred Stock, the holders of shares of
Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to receive dividends.

(b) ‘The holders of shares of the Voting Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive
dividends, out of any assets legally available therefor, prior and in preference to any declaration
or payment of any dividend (payable other than in Common Stock or other securities and rights
convertible into or entitling the holder thereof to receive, directly or indirectly, additional shares
of Common Stock of the Corporation) on the Common Stock, at the applicable Dividend Rate
(as defined below), payable when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors. Such dividends
shall not be cumulative. “Dividend Rate” shall mean $.80 per annum for each share of Series B
Preferred Stock and Series A-1 Preferred Stock and shall mean $1.20 per annum for each share
of Series C Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any Recapitalization Event). All dividend payments
pursuant to this Section IV(b) shall be made to the holders of Voting Preferred Stock pro rata.

19
No dividends shall accrue or be payable with respect to the shares of the Series A-2 Preferred
Stock.

(c) When and as dividends are declared payable in cash or property, other than shares
of the Corporation’s capital stock, with respect to shares of Common Stock, the Corporation
shall declare at the same time and pay to each holder of shares of Voting Preferred Stock a
dividend equal to the dividend that would have been payable to such holder if the shares of
Voting Preferred Stock held by such holder had been converted into Common Stock on the
record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such dividend.

(d) —_ No distributions shall be declared or paid on any Common Stock of the
Corporation during any fiscal year of the Corporation until dividends in the amounts set forth in
Sections [V(b) and (c) have been paid to, or declared and set apart upon, all outstanding shares of
Voting Preferred Stock during that fiscal year. .

(e) Except as otherwise set forth in Section I(g), in the event the Corporation shall
declare a distribution payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by
the Corporation or other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not
referred to in Section II(h)(ii), in each case as permitted hereunder, and such distribution does
not constitute a Liquidation Event or a Deemed Liquidation Event as set forth in Section I, then,
in each such case for the purpose of this Section IV, the holders of the Voting Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any such distribution as though they were the holders
of the number of shares of Common Stock into which their shares of Voting Preferred Stock are
convertible as of the record date fixed for the determination of the holders of Common Stock
entitled to receive such distribution.

V. Redemption. The Preferred Stock shall not be redeemable.

liability is provided by applicable laws, (i) for any breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to the
Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve
intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the DGCL, or
(iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. If the
DGCL is amended to further eliminate or limit the personal liability of directors, then the
liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent
permitted by the DGCL as so amended.

In the event that a director of the Corporation who is also a partner or employee of an
entity that is a holder of Preferred Stock and that is in the business of investing and reinvesting in
other entities, or an employee of an entity that manages such an entity (each, a “Fund’), acquires
knowledge of a potential transaction or matter in such person’s capacity as a partner or employee
of the Fund or the manager or general partner of the Fund and that may be a corporate
opportunity for both the Corporation and such Fund (a “Corporate Opportunity”), then (i) such
Corporate Opportunity shall belong to such Fund, (ii) such director shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, have fully satisfied and fulfilled his fiduciary duty to the Corporation and its
stockholders with respect to such Corporate Opportunity, and (iii) the Corporation, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, waives any claim that such Corporate Opportunity constituted a
corporate opportunity that should have been presented to the Corporation or any of its affiliates;

nothing herein or otherwise shall limit the Corporation’s right to pursue or consummate any
transaction related to any Corporate Opportunity even if originated by any director or any Fund.

Any amendment, repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article
Seventh by the stockholders of the Corporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection

21
of a director of the Corporation existing at the time of, or increase the liability of any director of
the Corporation with respect to any acts or omissions of such director occurring prior to, such
repeal or modification.

subject to the rights of the holders of Preferred Stock, if any, to approve them, to authorize and
cause to be executed mortgages and liens, without limit as to the amount, upon the property and
