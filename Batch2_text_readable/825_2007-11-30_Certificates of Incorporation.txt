such shares of Common Stock as of such date. If the conversion is in connection with an underwritten
offering of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act the conversion may, at the option of any
holder tendering such Series A Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the

immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate

claim has been received by the Company; or (ii) a claim under this Article for

paid to Indemnitee for any reason other than those set forth in subparagraphs 5.2(a), 5.2(b), and
5.2(c) of Section 5.2 of this Article (for example, because indemnification is held to be against
public policy even though otherwise permitted under Section 5.2) then in respect of any
proceeding in which the Company is jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such
proceeding), the Company shal] contribute to the amount of loss paid or payable by Indemnitee in
such proportion as is appropriate to reflect: the relative benefits received by the Company on the
one hand and the Indemnitee on the other hand from the transaction from which such proceeding
arose, and the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Indemnitee on the other
hand in connection with the events which resulted in such loss, as well as any other relevant
equitable consideration, The relative benefits received by and fault of the Company on the one
hand and the Indemnitee on the other shall be determined by a court of appropriate jurisdiction
(which may be the same court in which the proceeding took place) with reference to, among other
things, the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or
prevent the circumstances resulting in such loss. The Company agrees that it would not be just
and equitable if a contribution pursuant to this Article was determined by pro rata allocation or

_ any other method of allocation which does not take account of the foregoing equitable

considerations.

Exceptions, Any other provision herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company shall not
be obligated pursuant to the terms of these Articles to indemnify or advance expenses to
Indemniteé with respect to any proceeding: (i) initiated voluntarily by Indemnitee and not by way
of defense, unless brought to establish or enforce a right to indemnification under these Articles
or any other statute or law or as otherwise required under the statute; (ii) instituted by Indemnitee
to enforce or interpret this Article, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that each of the
material assertions made by Indemnitee in such proceeding was not made in good faith or was
frivolous; (iii) for which any of the expenses or liabilities. for indemnification is being sought

(b) Applicable Conversion Rate. The conversion rate in effect at any time
(the “Applicable Conversion Rate”} for any share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be the quotient

share, determined as hereinafter provided, in effect on the date the certificate is surrendered for

would purchase at the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance, and (y) the
denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Outstanding Common Stock immediately prior to
such issuance plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock so issued. For purposes of the
foregoing calculation, the term “Outstanding Common Stock” shall mean the number of shares of
Common Stock actually issued and outstanding at the time of determination plus the number of shares of

Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents without payment of any consideration by such holder for
the additional shares of Common Stock or the Common Stock Equivalents (including the additional
shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof), then, as of such record date (or
the date of such dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no record date is fixed), the Conversion Price

expenses in advance of a final disposition of the proceeding must furnish the Company,

claim has been received by the Company; or (ii) a claim under this Article for

time thereafter bring suit against the Company to recover the unpaid amount of the claim,

indemnification or reimbursement or advancement of expenses to the Indemnitee is
proper in the circumstances, nor (ii) an actual determination by the Company that the
Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or to the reimbursement or advancement of
expenses, shall be a defense to the proceeding or create a presumption that the
Indemnitee is not so entitled,

5.6.5 Nonexclusivity of Rights. The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses
incurred in defending a Proceeding in advance of its final disposition granted in this
Article shal] not be exclusive of any other right which any Indemnitee may have or
hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of this Article or the bylaws, agreement,
vote of shareholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise. The Company shall have the
express right to grant additional indemnity without seeking further approval or
satisfaction by the shareholders. Al] applicable indemnity provisions and any applicable
law shall be interpreted and applied so as to provide an Indemnitee with the broadest but
nonduplicative indemnity to which he or she is entitled,

Contribution. If the indemnification provided in Section 5.2 of this Article is not available to be
paid to Indemnitee for any reason other than those set forth in subparagraphs 5.2(a), 5.2(b), and
5.2(c) of Section 5.2 of this Article (for example, because indemnification is held to be against
public policy even though otherwise permitted under Section 5.2) then in respect of any
proceeding in which the Company is jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such
proceeding), the Company shall contribute to the amount of loss paid or payable by Indemnitee in
such proportion as is appropriate to reflect: the relative benefits received by the Company on the
one hand and the Indemnitee on the other hand from the transaction from which such proceeding
arose, and the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Indemnitee on the other
hand in connection with the events which resulted in such loss, as well as any other relevant
equitable consideration. The relative benefits received by and fault of the Company on the one
hand and the Indemnitee on the other shall be determined by a court of appropriate jurisdiction
(which may be the same court in which the proceeding took place) with reference to, among other
things, the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or
prevent the circumstances resulting in such loss. The Company agrees that it would not be just
and equitable if a contribution pursuant to this Article was determined by pro rata allocation or
any other method of allocation which does not take account of the foregoing equitable
considerations.

Exceptions. Any other provision herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company shal] not
be obligated pursuant to the terms of these Articles to indemnify or advance expenses to
Indemnitee with respect to any proceeding: (i) initiated voluntarily by Indemnitee and not by way
of defense, unless brought to establish or enforce a right to indemnification under these Articles
or any other statute or law or as otherwise required under the statute; (ii) instituted by Indemnitee
to enforce or interpret this Article, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that each of the
material assertions made by Indemnitee in such proceeding was not made in good faith or was
frivolous; (iii) for which any of the expenses or liabilities for indemnification is being sought

applicable law as then in effect from paying such indemnification and/or advancement of
expenses,
