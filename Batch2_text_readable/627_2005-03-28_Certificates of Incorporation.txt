Corporation's capital stock is permitted to participate with Series D Junior Stock in the
distribution of any assets remaining after the holders of such class or series of capital stock (of
each series then outstanding) have been paid their liquidation preference, if any, then the holders
of the Series D-2 Preferred Stock shall also be permitted to participate in such distribution in

PN G9S37T00
proportion to the number of shares of Common Stock, determined on an as-converted basis, held
by such holders. If upon occurrence of such event the assets and property thus distributed among
the holders of the Series D-2 Preferred Stock and the Series D Parity Stock, if any, is insufficient
to permit the payment to such holders of the full preferential amount, then the entire assets and
vroperty of the Corporation legally available for distribution shall, subject to the prior payment

of shares of Series D-2 Preferred Stock to be converted. The “Series D-2 Conversion Price” for

exercise of such options or, in the case of convertible securities and options therefor, the
conversion or exchange of such convertible securities or exercisc of such options, shall be

i) in the case of convertible securities
or options for Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common issucd
were the shares of Common Stock, if any, actually issued upon the exercise of
such options or the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities and the

IN G S306
consideration received therefor was the consideration actually received by the
Corporation for the issue of such exercised options plus the consideration actually
received by the Corporation upon such exercise or for the issue of all such
convertible securities which were actually converted or exchanged, plus the
additional consideration, if any, actually received by the Corporation upon such
conversion or exchange, and

ii) in the case of options for convertible
securities, only the convertible securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise
thereor were issucd at the time of issue of such options, and the consideration
received by the Corporation for the Additional Shares of Commion deemed to
have been then issued was the consideration actually received by the Corporation

of Additional Shares of Common. In the event the Corporation issues or is deemed to issue
Additional Shares of Common without consideration or for consideration per share less than the
applicable Series D-2 Conversion Price in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such
issue, then and in such event, the Series D-2 Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently
with such issue (the “Series D-2 Weighted Average Antidilution”), to a price (calculated to the
nearest cent) determined by multiplying the Series D-2 Conversion Price by a fraction, the
numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
before such issue plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration
received by the Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of Common so issued
would purchase at such Series D-2 Conversion Price, and the denominator of which shall be the
number of shares of Common Stock vutstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number
of such Additionai Shares of Coinmon so issued; and provided further, that for the purposes of
this paragraph 5(c)(iv), all shares uf Common Stock issuable upon exercise, conversion or
exchange of outstanding options, preferred stock (including without limitation Series D-2
Preferred Stock and Series D Parity Stock) and other convertible securities, as the case may be,

deemed issued, such Additional Shares of Common shall be deemed to be outstanding.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the holders of shares in a future class or series of the
Corporation’s capital stock have a conversion price adjustment upon the issuance of Additional
Shares of Common such that the conversion price applicable to such shares of capital stock is
equal io the quotient of the aggregate consideration received for the Additional Shares of
Common divided by the number of Additional Shares of Common (“Ratchet Antidilution’),

fe re Rees)

adjusted for such Ratchet Antidilution rights as to any Additional Shares of Common rather than
the Series D-2 Weighted Average Antidilution rights described above.

(b} combined or consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of
Common Stock or (c) changed into a different number of shares of any other class or classes of
stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise, the holders of the shares
of Series D-2 Preferred Stock shall receive upon conversion, the stock and/or securities to which
the holder would have been entitled had the holder held, at the time of said split, subdivision,
conibination, consolidation, reorganizatiun or reclassification, the number of shares of Common

event the Corporation at any time after the date of the first issuance of the Series D-2 Preferred

holders of the shares of Series D-2 Preferred Stock shall receive upon conversion, in addition to
the number of shares of Common Stock receivable thereupon, the stock or securities to which the
holder would have been entitled had the holder held, at the time of said dividend or other
distribution, the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Series D-2 Preferred Stock
could have converted immediately prior to such event, and had such holders thereafter during the
period from the date of such cvent to and including the date of conversion, retained such stock or
securities receivable by such holders as aforesaid during such period, subject to all other
adjustments called for during such period under this paragraph 5 with respect to the rights of the
holders of the Series D-2 Preferred Stock.

(2) Options and _ Convertible Securities. The

options or convertible securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of
additionai consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto,
without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent
adjustment of such consideration) payable to the Corporation upon the
exercise of such options or the conversion or exchange of such convertible
securities, or in the case of options for convertible securities, the exercise
of such options for convertible sccurities and the conversion or exchange
of such convertible securities by

(y) the maximum number of shares of Common

immediately prior to such subdivision shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such
subdivision, be proportionately decreased. In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock
shall be combined (by reclassification or otherwise) into a lesser number of shares of Common
Stock, the Series D-2 Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such combination shall,
concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination, be proportionately increased.
