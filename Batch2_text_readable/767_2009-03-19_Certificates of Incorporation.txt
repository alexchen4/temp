the applicable Conversion Price shall not be so reduced at such time if the amount of such
reduction would be an amount less than $0.001, but any such amount shall be carried forward
and a reduction with respect thereto shall be made at the time of and together with any
subsequent reduction which, together with such amount and any amounts so carried forward,
shall aggregate $0.001 or more.

(f) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this Section 4.2, the
consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional Shares of Common
Stock shall be computed as follows:

(1) Cash and Property. Such consideration shall:

(i) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
aggregate of cash received by the Corporation, excluding amounts paid or payable for accrued
interest or accrucd dividends;

(ii) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair market value thereof at the time of such issue, as reasonably determined in
good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation; and

(iii) in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock
are issued together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for
consideration which covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed
as provided in clauses (i) and (ii) above, as reasonably determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors of the Corporation.

(2) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per

share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been
issued pursuant to Section 4.2(c) relating to Options and Convertible Securities shall be
determined by dividing:

(i) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by
the Corporation as consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the
minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating
thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such
consideration until such subsequent adjustment occurs) payable to the Corporation upon the
exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the
-13-

case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options for Convertible
Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, by

(ii) | the maximum number of shares of Common Stock
(as set forth in instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for
a subsequent adjustment of such number until such subsequent adjustment occurs) issuable upon
the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities.

(g) Adjustment for Stock Splits, Stock Dividends, Subdivisions,
Combinations or Consolidation of Common Stock. In the event the outstanding shares of
Common Stock shall be split, subdivided, combined or consolidated, by reclassification or
otherwise, into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, and/or in the event that
the Corporation shall issue shares of Common Stock by way of a stock dividend or other
distribution to the holders of Common Stock, the Conversion Price for each series of Preferred
Stock in effect immediately prior to such split, subdivision, stock dividend, distribution
combination or consolidation shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such split, subdivision,
stock dividend, distribution combination or consolidation, be increased or decreased
proportionately.

(h) Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. In the cvent the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall make or issue, or

fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive a dividend
or other distribution (other than a distribution in liquidation or other distribution otherwise
provided for herein) with respect to the Common Stock payable in securities of the Corporation
other than shares of Common Stock, then and in each such event provision shall be made so that
the holders of Preferred Stock shall receive upon conversion thereof in addition to the number of
shares of Common Stock receivable thereupon, the amount of securities of the Corporation that
they would have received had their Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock on the
date of such event and had they thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to and
including the Conversion Date, as defined in Section 4.4(a), retained such securities receivable
by them as aforesaid during such period, giving application to all adjustments called for during
such period under this Section 4 with respect to the nights of the holders of Preferred Stock.

(i) Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange or Substitution. If the
Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same
or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock or other securities or property,
whether by capital reorganization, reclassification, or otherwise (other than a subdivision or
combination of shares or stock dividend provided for above, or a reorganization, merger,
consolidation, or sale of assets provided for below), then and in each such event the holder of
each such share of Preferred Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such share into the
kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property receivable upon such
reorganization, reclassification, or other change, by holders of the number of shares of Common
Stock into which such shares of Preferred Stock might have been converted immediately prior to
such reorganization, reclassification, or change, all subject to further adjustment as provided
herein.
-14-

4.3. Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued
upon conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would
otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to the product of such fraction
multiplied by the then effective Conversion Price for the applicable series of Preferred Stock.

4.4 Mechanics of Conversion.

(a) In order for a holder of any series of Preferred Stock to convert shares
of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall give wntten notice to the
Corporation that such holder elects to convert shares of Preferred Stock and shall surrender the
certificate or certificates for such shares of Preferred Stock, at the office of the transfer agent for
the Preferred Stock (or at the principal office of the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its
own transfer agent), together with written notice that such holder elects to convert all or any
number of the shares of the Preferred Stock represented by such certificate or certificates. Such
notice shall state such holder’s name or the names of the nominees in which such holder wishes
the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued and the number of shares
of Preferred Stock to be converted. If required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for
conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer,
in form reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or his
or its attorney duly authorized in writing. The date of receipt of such certificates and notice by
the transfer agent (or by the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent) shall
be the conversion date (the “Conversion Date”) and the conversion shall be deemed effective as
of the close of business on the Conversion Date in accordance with paragraph (d) below. The
Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after the Conversion Date, issue and deliver to such
holder of Preferred Stock, or to his or its nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of
shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled, together with cash in lieu of any
fraction of a share in an amount equal to the same fraction of the market price per share of the
Common Stock (as determined in a reasonable manner prescribed by the Board of Directors of
the Corporation) at the close of business on the Conversion Date. The determination as to
whether or not any fractional shares are issuable shall be based upon the aggregate number of
shares of Preferred Stock being converted at any one time by a holder thereof, not upon each
share of Preferred Stock being converted.

(b) The Corporation shall at all times when any series of Preferred Stock
is outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued stock, for the
purpose of effecting the conversion of the Preferred Stock, such number of its duly authorized
shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock. Before taking any action that would cause an adjustment
reducing the Conversion Price below the then-existing par value of the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon conversion of Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall take any corporate action that
may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Corporation may validly and
legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion
Price.

(c) Upon any such conversion, no adjustment to the Conversion Price for
any series of Preferred Stock shall be made for any declared and unpaid dividends on such series
-15-

of Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion or on the Common Stock delivered upon
conversion.

(d) All shares of Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion as herein
provided shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares,
including the rights, if any, to receive notices, to vote and to dividends shall immediately cease
and terminate at the close of business on the Conversion Date (except only the right of the
holders thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor and to receive unpaid
dividends declared prior to conversion). Any shares of Preferred Stock so converted shall be
retired and canceled and shall not be reissued, and the Corporation from time to time shall take
appropriate action to reduce the authorized Preferred Stock accordingly.

45 Certificates as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4,
the Corporation at its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in
accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to cach holder of each series of Preferred Stock
affected by such adjustment or readjustment a certificate setting forth such adjustment or
readjustment and showing in reasonable detail the facts upon which such adjustment or
readjustment is based. The Corporation shall upon the reasonable written request of any holder
of any series of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder as soon as
practicable a similar certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and readjustments, (ii) the
Conversion Price then in effect for such series of Preferred Stock, and (iii) the number of shares
of Common Stock and the amount if any, of other property that would then be received upon the
conversion of Preferred Stock.

4.6 Merger or Salc of Assets. If at any time or from time to time there shall be
a Disposition, as defined in Section 2.3, then, as a part thereof, provision shall be made so that
the holders of the Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of the
Preferred Stock the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the Corporation,
or of the successor corporation resulting from such Disposition, to which a holder of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion would have been entitled on such Disposition. In any such case,
appropriate adjustment (as reasonably determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation) shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 4.6 with respect to
the rights and interest thereafter of the holders of the Preferred Stock after the Disposition to
ensure that the provisions of this Section 4.6 (including adjustment of the Conversion Price then
in effect and the number of shares or other securities or property acquirable upon conversion of
each series of Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after the Disposition in as nearly equivalent a
manner as may be practicable. Each holder of Preferred Stock, upon the occurrence of a
Disposition, shall have the option of electing treatment under either this Section 4.6 or (unless
the holders of at least 60% of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock,
voting as a single class on an as-converted basis, elect that the Disposition not be treated as a
liquidation pursuant to Section 2.3) Section 2.3, notice of which election shall be submitted in
writing to the Corporation at its principal offices no later than ten days after the effective date of
such Disposition.

4.7 Notice of Record Date. In the event that any of the following occurs:

(a) the Corporation declares a dividend upon its Common Stock or makes
any other distribution on its Common Stock payable in Common Stock or other securities of the
Corporation;

(b) the Corporation subdivides or combines its outstanding shares of
Common Stock;

(c) there occurs any reclassification of the Common Stock of the
Corporation (other than a subdivision or combination of its outstanding shares of Common Stock

Corporation into or with another corporation, or of the sale or other conveyance of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Corporation; or

(d) the involuntary or voluntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of
the Corporation;

Corporation or such transfer agent, at least ten days prior to the record date specified in (1) below
or twenty days before the date specified in (2) below, a notice stating the following information:

(1) the record date of such dividend, distribution, subdivision
or combination, or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of Common
Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distribution, subdivision, or combination are to be
determined, or

(2) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation,
merger, sale or other conveyance, liquidation, dissolution or winding-up is expected to become
effective, and the date, as of which it is expected that holders of Common Stock of record shall
be entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable
upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale or other conveyance, liquidation,
dissolution or winding-up.

4.8 Mandatory Conversion of Preferred Stock.

(a) Mandatory Conversion. All outstanding shares of Preferred Stock
shal] be automatically converted into shares of Common Stock at the then effective Conversion

Stock issuable upon such conversion, notwithstanding that the certificates representing such
shares of any series of Preferred Stock shall not have been surrendered at the office of the
Corporation, that notice from the Corporation shall not have been received by any holder of

or performed hereunder by the Corporation but will at all times in good faith assist in the
carrying out of all the provisions of this Section 4 and in the taking of all such action as may be
necessary or appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holders of the Preferred

The Corporation hereby renounces any interest or expectancy of the Corporation or any
of its subsidiaries in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any Excluded
Opportunity. For purposes of this Article X, an “Excluded Opportunity” shall mean any

otherwise comes into the possession of, (i) any director of the Corporation who is not an
employee of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, or (it) any holder of Preferred Stock or
affiliate of any such holder or any partner, member, director, stockholder, employee or agent of
any such holder or affiliate (including any representative or affiliate of such holders of Preferred
Stock serving on the Board of Directors or the board of directors or similar governing body of
any subsidiary of the Company), other than someone who is an employee of the Corporation or
any of its subsidiaries (collectively, “Covered Persons’’).

Without limiting the foregoing, the Corporation on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries
(i) acknowledges that the Covered Persons are in the business of making investments in, and
have or may have investments in, other businesses similar to and that may compete with the
businesses of the Corporation und its subsidiaries (‘Competing Businesses”) and (ii) agrees that

such Covered Person serving on or observing meetings of the Board or the board of directors or
other governing body of any subsidiary of the Corporation or otherwise, no Covered Person shall

subsidiaries, making investments in or having relationships with Competing Businesscs, or
otherwise engaging in good faith in any commercial activity; and none of the Corporation, any of

the Corporation or its subsidiaries even if such opportunity is of a character that, if presented to
the Corporation or such subsidiary, could be taken by the Corporation or any subsidiary thereof,
and each Covered Person shall continue to have the right for its own respective account or to
recommend to others any such particular investment opportunity.
