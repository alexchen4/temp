corporate reorganization, in which the stockholders of the Corporation immediately prior
to such consolidation, merger or reorganization, do not hold at least a majority of the
resulting or surviving corporation’s voting power immediately after such consolidation,
merger or reorganization (solely in respect of their equity interests in the Corporation),
(ii) the sale, lease, exclusive license or other disposition of all or substantially all of the
assets of the Corporation or (iii) a Sale of Voting Control (each, a “Change of Control
Transaction”) shall be deemed to be a Liquidation Event, unless the holders of at least a
majority of the Preferred Stock, consenting or voting, as the case may be, together as a
single class, determine otherwise; provided, however, that the initial issuance and sale of
up to 48,438,780 shares of Series D Preferred Stock to certain investors on or about April
2007 shall not be deemed to be a Liquidation Event or a Change of Contro! Transaction.
In the event of a Change of Control Transaction, each holder of Preferred Stock shall take
all actions as may be required to distribute the liquidation proceeds in accordance with
the provisions herein stated. “Sale of Voting Control” means the transfer by the

stock of the Corporation in connection with a financing transaction shall not be deemed a
"Sale of Voting Control”.

distributed under this Section 2 in a form other than cash, the fair market value of such
assets shall be determined in good faith by the Corporation and the holders of not less

OHS West:260232909.4 6
16001-1
than a majority of the shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding. Any securities shall be
valued as follows:

— i) Securities not subject to investment letter or other
similar restrictions on free marketability covered by (ii) below:

(A) _ If traded on a securities exchange or through the
Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”), the value shall be deemed to be the average of the
closing prices of the securities on such exchange or Nasdaq over the 10 day period
ending three days prior to the closing;

(B) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall
be deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable)
over the 30 day period ending three days prior to the closing; and

(C) If there is no active public market, the value shall be
the fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(ii) The method of valuation of securities subject to
investment letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions
arising solely by virtue of a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall
be to make an appropriate discount from the market value determined as above in (i)
(A), (B) or (C) to reflect the approximate fair market value thereof, as determined in
good faith by the Board of Directors.

(iii) | The Corporation shall give each holder of record of
Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred, Stock Series C Preferred Stock and
Series D Preferred Stock written notice of the transaction which, if effected, will
constitute a Liquidation Event or Change of Control Transaction not later than 20 days
prior to the stockholders’ meeting called to approve such transaction, or 20 days prior
to the closing of such transaction, whichever is earlier, and shall also notify such
holders in writing of the final approval of such transaction. The first notice shall
describe the material terms and conditions of the pending transaction and the
provisions of this Section 2(e). The Corporation shall thereafter give such holders
prompt notice of any material changes in the terms of the pending transaction. The
transaction shall in no event take place sooner than 20 days after the Corporation has
given the first notice or sooner than 10 days after the Corporation has given notice of
any material changes in the terms of such transaction. In the event the requirements of
this Section 2(e) are not complied with, the Corporation shall forthwith either:

(A) cause such closing to be postponed until such time
as the requirements of this Section 2(e) have been complied with; or

(B) cancel such transaction, in which event the rights,
preferences and privileges of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock,
Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock shall continue in effect in
accordance with the terms of this Certificate of Incorporation, as the same may be
amended from time to time.

3. Conversion.

(a) Conversion of Series D Preferred Stock. The holders of Series D
Preferred Stock shall have the following conversion rights (the “Series D Conversion

Rights”):

(i) Right to Convert. Each share of Series D Preferred
Stock shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time and from
time to time, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common
Stock as is determined by dividing the Original Series D Issue Price (as adjusted for
any stock splits, stock dividends, reverse stock splits, stock combinations and other
similar capitalization changes) by the Series D Conversion Price (as defined below) in
effect at the time of conversion. The conversion price of Series D Preferred Stock (the
“Series D Conversion Price’) shall initially be $1.3419 per share. The Series D
Conversion Price, and the rate at which shares of Series D Preferred Stock may be
converted into shares of Common Stock, shall be subject to adjustment as provided
below.

(ii) | Automatic Conversion. All shares of Series D Preferred
Stock then outstanding shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock,
at the then effective Series D Conversion Price, upon (A) the vote or consent in
writing of (1) holders of at least a two-thirds (2/3) of the shares of Preferred Stock then
outstanding (the “Majority Preferred Stockholders”) and (2) holders of at least a two-
thirds (2/3) of the shares of Series D Preferred Stock then outstanding that all of the
Preferred Stock shall be converted into shares of Common Stock, or (B) upon the
closing of the sale of shares of Common Stock in a firm commitment underwritten
public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the.“‘Securities Act”), in which (1) the public offering price per
share is at least three (3) times the Original Series D Issue Price (as adjusted for any
stock splits, stock dividends, reverse stock splits, stock combinations and other similar
capitalization changes), and (II) the net cash proceeds to the Corporation (after
deduction of underwriting discount, commissions and expenses of sale) are at least

$25,000,000 (a “Qualified Public Offering”).

(iii) | Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common
Stock shall be issued upon conversion of Series D Preferred Stock. In lieu of any
fractional shares to which a holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall
pay cash in an amount equal to the product (calculated to the nearest cent) of such
fraction and the fair market value of one share of Common Stock as determined in
good faith by the Board of Directors. Whether or not fractional shares are issuable
upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of
Series D Preferred Stock that the holder is then converting into Common Stock and the
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such shares of
Series D Preferred Stock.

OHS West:260232909.4 g
16001-1
(iv) Mechanics of Conversion.

(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B) below, in
order for a holder of Series D Preferred Stock to convert shares of Series D Preferred
Stock into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the certificate or
certificates representing such shares of Series D Preferred Stock, at the office of the
transfer agent for the Series D Preferred Stock (or at the principal office of the
Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent), together with written
notice that such holder elects to convert all or any portion of the shares of the Series D
Preferred Stock represented by such certificate or certificates. Such notice shall state
such holder’s name or the names of the nominees in which such holder wishes the —
certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued. If required by the
Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by
a written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation,
duly executed by the registered holder or such holder’s attorney duly authorized in
writing. The date of receipt of such certificates and notice by the transfer agent (or by the
Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent) shall be the conversion
date (“Series D. Conversion Date”). If the conversion is in connection with an
underwritten offering of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act that is not a
Qualified Public Offering, the conversion may at the option of any holder tendering
Series D Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the
underwriter of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering, in which event the
person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of
Series D Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Series D Preferred
Stock until immediately prior to the closing of the sale of securities. The Corporation
shall, as soon as practicable after the Series D Conversion Date, issue and deliver to the
holder of such Series D Preferred Stock, or to such holder’s nominees, a certificate or
certificates representing the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled upon conversion of such Series D Preferred Stock, together with cash in lieu of
any fractional share.

(B) In the event of a conversion pursuant to
Section 3(a)(ii) above, the outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock shall be
converted automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and
whether or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation
or its transfer agents. Such automatic conversion shall be deemed to have been made on
the effective date of the applicable vote or written consent or immediately prior to the
closing of the Qualified Public Offering, as the case may be, and the person or persons
entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be
treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock
on such date, which date shall be the “Series D Automatic Conversion Date.”
Immediately upon such automatic conversion, all shares of Series D Preferred Stock shall
no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares,
including the rights, if any, to receive notices and to vote, shall immediately cease and
terminate, except only the right of the holders thereof, upon surrender of their certificate
or certificates therefor, to receive certificates representing the number of shares of
Common Stock into which such Series D Preferred Stock has been converted, together

OHS West:260232909.4 9
16001-1
with cash in lieu of any fractional share, as provided in Section 3(a)(iii) above. In the
event that the automatic conversion of Series D Preferred Stock is pursuant to the vote or
consent of the Majority Preferred Stockholders that all of the Preferred Stock be
converted into shares of Common Stock, the Majority Preferred Stockholders shall give
written notice to the Corporation and to each other holder of Preferred Stock (the
“Majority Preferred Conversion Notice”) promptly following the vote or consent, as
applicable, that all of the Preferred Stock, including shares of Series D Preferred Stock,
shall be converted to Common Stock. In the event that the automatic conversion of
Series D Preferred Stock is in connection with a Qualified Public Offering, the
Corporation shall give the holders of Series D Preferred Stock reasonable notice of, but in
no event less than 45 business days prior to, the closing of the Qualified Public Offering.
Promptly following the date on which the Majority Preferred Stockholders give the
Majority Preferred Conversion Notice or at the closing of the Qualified Public Offering,
as the case may be, each holder of Series D Preferred Stock shall surrender to the
Corporation or its transfer agent the certificate(s) representing such holder’s Series D
Preferred Stock together with a notice that states such holder’s name or the names of the
nominees in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of
Common Stock to be issued. If so required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered
for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by written instrument or instruments of
transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or
such holder’s attorney duly authorized in writing. The Corporation shall not be obligated
to issue certificates representing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such
automatic conversion unless and until the certificates representing such shares of Series D
Preferred Stock are either delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent as provided
above, or the holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificate or
certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to
the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection
with such certificates, including an indemnity bond in such amount as the Corporation
deems appropriate in its discretion. As soon as practicable following the Series D
Automatic Conversion Date and the surrender by the holder of the certificate or
certificates representing Series D Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall cause to be
issued and delivered to such holder, or to such holder’s nominees, a certificate or
certificates representing the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled upon conversion of such Series D Preferred Stock, together with cash in lieu of
any fractional share.

(C) . The Corporation shail at all times when shares of
Series D Preferred Stock are outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized
but unissued stock, for the purpose of effecting the conversion of Series D Preferred
Stock, such number of its duly authorized shares of Common Stock as shall from time to
time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of Series D Preferred
Stock in shares of Common Stock. Before taking any action which would cause an
adjustment reducing the Series D Conversion Price below the then par value of the shares
of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of Series D Preferred Stock, the Corporation
will take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in
order that the Corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable
shares of Common Stock at such adjusted Series D Conversion Price.

OHS West:260232909.4 10
1601-1
(b) Conversion of Series C Preferred Stock. The holders of Series C
Preferred Stock shall have the following conversion rights (the “Series C Conversion

Rights”):

(i) Right to Convert. Each share of Series C Preferred
Stock shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time and from
time to time, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common
Stock as is determined by dividing the Original Series C Issue Price (as adjusted for
any stock splits, stock dividends, reverse stock splits, stock combinations and other
similar capitalization changes) by the Series C Conversion Price (as defined below) in
effect at the time of conversion. The conversion price of Series C Preferred Stock (the
“Series C Conversion Price”) shall initially be $1.0735 per share. The Series C
Conversion Price, and the rate at which shares of Series C Preferred Stock may be
converted into shares of Common Stock, shall be subject to adjustment as provided
below.

(ii) | Automatic Conversion. All shares of Series C Preferred
Stock then outstanding shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock,
at the then effective Series C Conversion Price, upon (A) the vote or consent in writing
of holders of the Majority Preferred Stockholders that all of the Preferred Stock shall
be converted into shares of Common Stock, or (B) upon the closing of a Qualified
Public Offering.

(iii) | Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common
Stock shall be issued upon conversion of Series C Preferred Stock. In lieu of any
fractional shares to which a holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall
pay cash in an amount equal to the product (calculated to the nearest cent) of such
fraction and the fair market value of one share of Common Stock as determined in
good faith by the Board of Directors. Whether or not fractional shares are issuable
upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of
Series C Preferred Stock that the holder is then converting into Common Stock and the
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such shares of
Series C Preferred Stock.

(iv) Mechanics of Conversion.

(A) | Except as provided in subparagraph (B) below, in
order for a holder of Series C Preferred Stock to convert shares of Series C Preferred
Stock into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the certificate or
certificates representing such shares of Series C Preferred Stock, at the office of the
transfer agent for the SeriesC Preferred Stock (or at the principal office of the
Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent), together with written
notice that such holder elects to convert all or any portion of the shares of the Series C
Preferred Stock represented by such certificate or certificates. Such notice shall state
such holder’s name or the names of the nominees in which such holder wishes the
certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued. If required by the
Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by

OHS West:260232909.4 11
16001-1
a written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation,
duly executed by the registered holder or such holder’s attorney duly authorized in
writing. The date of receipt of such certificates and notice by the transfer agent (or by the
Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent) shall be the conversion
date (“Series C Conversion Date”). If the conversion is in connection with an
underwritten offering of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act that is not a
Qualified Public Offering, the conversion may at the option of any holder tendering
Series C Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the
underwriter of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering, in which event the
person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of
Series C Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Series C Preferred
Stock until immediately prior to the closing of the sale of securities. The Corporation
shall, as soon as practicable after the Series C Conversion Date, issue and deliver to the
holder of such Series C Preferred Stock, or to such-holder’s nominees, a certificate or
certificates representing the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled upon conversion of such Series C Preferred Stock, together with cash in lieu of
any fractional share.

(B) In the event of a conversion pursuant to
Section 3(b)(ii) above, the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall be
converted automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and
whether or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation
or its transfer agents. Such automatic conversion shall be deemed to have been made on
the effective date of the applicable vote or written consent or immediately prior to the
closing of the Qualified Public Offering, as the case may be, and the person or persons
entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be
treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock
on such date, which date shall be the “Series C Automatic Conversion Date.”
Immediately upon such automatic conversion, all shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall
no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares,
including the rights, if any, to receive notices and to vote, shall immediately cease and
terminate, except only the right of the holders thereof, upon surrender of their certificate
or certificates therefor, to receive certificates representing the number of shares of
Common Stock into which such Series C Preferred Stock has been converted, together
with cash in lieu of any fractional share, as provided in Section 3(b)(iii) above. In the
event that the automatic conversion of Series C Preferred Stock is pursuant to the vote or
consent of the Majority Preferred Stockholders that all of the Preferred Stock be
converted into shares of Common Stock, the Majority Preferred Stockholders shall give
the Majority Preferred Conversion Notice to the Corporation and to each other holder of
Preferred Stock promptly following the vote or consent, as applicable, that all of the
Preferred Stock, including shares of Series C Preferred Stock, shall be converted to
Common Stock. In the event that the automatic conversion of Series C Preferred Stock is
in connection with a Qualified Public Offering, the Corporation shall give the holders of
Series C Preferred Stock reasonable notice of, but in no event less than 45 business days
prior to, the closing of the Qualified Public Offering. Promptly following the date on
which the Majority Preferred Stockholders give the Majority Preferred Conversion
Notice or at the closing of the Qualified Public Offering, as the case may be, each holder

OHS West:260232909.4 12
16001-1
of Series C Preferred Stock shall surrender to the Corporation or its transfer agent the
certificate(s) representing such holder’s Series C Preferred Stock together with a notice
that states such holder’s name or the names of the nominees in which such holder wishes
the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued. If so required by
the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or
accompanied by written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the
Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or such holder’s attorney duly
authorized in writing. The Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates
representing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such automatic conversion
unless and until the certificates representing such shares of Series C Preferred Stock are
either delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent as provided above, or the holder
notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificate or certificates have been
lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to
indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such
certificates, including an indemnity bond in such amount as the Corporation deems
appropriate in its discretion. As soon as practicable following the Series C Automatic
Conversion Date and the surrender by the holder of the certificate or certificates
representing Series C Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall cause to be issued and
delivered to such holder, or to such holder’s nominees, a certificate or certificates
representing the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
upon conversion of such Series C Preferred Stock, together with cash in lieu of any
fractional share.

(C) | The Corporation shall at all times when shares of
Series C Preferred Stock are outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized
but unissued stock, for the purpose of effecting the conversion of Series C Preferred
Stock, such number of its duly authorized shares of Common Stock as shall from time to
time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of Series C Preferred
Stock in shares of Common Stock. Before taking any action which would cause an
adjustment reducing the Series C Conversion Price below the then par value of the shares
of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of Series C Preferred Stock, the Corporation
will take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in
order that the Corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable
shares of Common Stock at such adjusted Series C Conversion Price.

(c) Conversion of Series B Preferred Stock. The holders of Series B
Preferred Stock shall have the following conversion rights (the “Series B Conversion

Rights”):

(i) Right to Convert. Each share of SeriesB Preferred
Stock shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time and from
time to time, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common
Stock as is determined by dividing the Original Series B Issue Price (as adjusted for
any stock splits, stock dividends, reverse stock splits, stock combinations and other
similar capitalization changes) by the Series B Conversion Price (as defined below) in
effect at the time of conversion. The conversion price of Series B Preferred Stock (the
“Series B_ Conversion Price’’) shall initially be $0.85 per share. The Series B

OHS West:260232909.4 13
16001-1
Conversion Price, and the rate at which shares of Series B Preferred Stock may be
converted into shares of Common Stock, shall be subject to adjustment as provided
below.

(ii) | Automatic Conversion. All shares of Series B Preferred
Stock then outstanding shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock,
at the then effective Series B Conversion Price, upon (A) the vote or consent in writing
of the Majority Preferred Stockholders that all of the Preferred Stock shall be
converted into shares of Common Stock, or (B) upon the closing of a Qualified Public
Offering.

(iii) | Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common
Stock shall be issued upon conversion of Series B Preferred Stock. In lieu of any
fractional shares to which a holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall
pay cash in an amount equal to the product (calculated to the nearest cent) of such
fraction and the fair market value of one share of Common Stock as determined in
good faith by the Board of Directors. Whether or not fractional shares are issuable
upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of
Series B Preferred Stock that the holder is then converting into Common Stock and the
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such shares of
Series B Preferred Stock.

(iv) | Mechanics of Conversion.

(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B) below, in
order for a holder of Series B Preferred Stock to convert shares of Series B Preferred

transfer agent for the Series B Preferred Stock (or at the principal office of the
Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent), together with written
notice that such holder elects to convert all or any portion of the shares of the Series B
Preferred Stock represented by such certificate or certificates. Such notice shall state
such holder’s name or the names of the nominees in which such holder wishes the
certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued. If required by the
Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by
a written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation,
duly executed by the registered holder or such holder’s attorney duly authorized in

determined by multiplying such SeriesD Conversion Price by a fraction, (x) the
numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding

Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of such
Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued; provided that for the purposes of this
Section 3(e)(iv), all shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of outstanding

immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares of Common Stock which
the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for the total number of
Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued would purchase at such Series B
Conversion Price or Series C Conversion Price, as applicable, and (y) the denominator
of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to such issuance plus the number of such Additional Shares of Common Stock so
issued; provided that for the purposes of this Section 3(e){iv), all shares of Common

of cash received by the Corporation after deducting any underwriting or similar
concessions, commissions or compensation paid or allowed by the Corporation,
excluding amounts paid or payable for accrued interest or accrued dividends;

(il) insofar as it consists of property other than
cash, be the fair market value thereof at the time of such issuance, as determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors; and

(1 in the event Additional Shares of Common
Stock are issued together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation
for consideration which covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received,
computed as provided in clauses (I) and (II) above, as determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors.

(B) Options and Convertible Securities. The
consideration per share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common
Stock deemed to have been issued pursuant to Section 3(e)(ili) above, relating to Options
and Convertible Securities, shall be determined by dividing:

(x) the total amount, if any, received or
receivable by the Corporation as consideration for the issuance of such Options or
Convertible Securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration
(as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained
therein designed to protect against dilution) payable to the Corporation upon the exercise
of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the
case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options for Convertible
Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, by

(y) the maximum number of shares of Common
Stock (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto without regard to any provision
contained therein designed to protect against dilution) issuable upon the exercise of such

the outstanding shares of Common Stock, each of the Series A Conversion Price, the
Series B Conversion Price, the Series C Conversion Price and the Series D Conversion

OHS West:260232909.4 24

with the effectiveness of such subdivision or combination.

(g) Adjustment for Common Stock Dividends and Distributions. If the

issue a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock, then

shall be decreased concurrently with the issuance of such dividend or distribution, by
multiplying the Series A Conversion Price then in effect, the Series B Conversion Price
then in effect, the Series C Conversion Price then in effect and the Series D Conversion
Price then in effect, respectively, by a fraction: (x) the numerator of which shall be the
total number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
time of such issuance, and (y) the denominator of which shall be the total number of
shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such
issuance plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such
dividend or distribution.

(h) Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. In the event
the Corporation at any time, or from time to time, after the Original Issue Date shall make
or issue a dividend or other distribution payable in property or securities of the
Corporation other than shares of Common Stock (and other than as otherwise adjusted in

converted into Common Stock immediately preceding the record date for the

substitution or other similar event (other than pursuant to subsections (f), (g) and (h)
above or a Change of Control Transaction which, pursuant to Article IV, Division B,
Section 2(f), is deemed to be a Liquidation Event), each holder of Series A Preferred
Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock
shall thereafter receive upon conversion of such Series A Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock or Series D Preferred Stock, in lieu of the
number of shares of Common Stock which such holder would otherwise have been
entitled to receive, the number of shares of such other class or classes of stock which a
holder of the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of the
shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred

OHS West:260232909.4 25
16001-1
