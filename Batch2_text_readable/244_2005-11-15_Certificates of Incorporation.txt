“Change in Control.”

(g) In the event of such a Change in Control, if the consideration received by the
Company or its stockholders is other than cash, the value of such non-cash consideration shall be deemed
its fair market value as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors as of the date of such Change
in Control. Any securities shall be valued as follows:

(i) Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar restrictions
on free marketability covered by Subsection D.4(g)(ii) below:

National Market, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on
such quotation system over the thirty (30) day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing;

(B) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the thirty (30)
day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing, and

market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Board of Directors and the holders of at least 70% of

power of all then outstanding shares of such Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class on an as-
converted basis and not as a separate series).

of Preferred Stock, then such holders shall not receive any amounts under such sections as holders of
Preferred Stock but shall be treated, for the purposes of determining such holders’ rights under such
sections only, as though such holders held, in addition to any shares of Common Stock then actually held
by such holders, such number of shares of Common Stock that such holders would hold if such holders
had then converted such holders’ shares of Preferred Stock into Common Stock, effective immediately
prior to such liquidation event, at the then applicable Conversion Rate for each series of Preferred Stock.

fixed for redemption unless the Company shall default in the payment of the redemption price, in which
case the right of conversion with respect to such shares shall continue unless and until such redemption
price is paid in full.

(b) Mechanics of Optional Conversions. Before any holder of Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to convert shares of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, the holder shall
surrender the certificate or certificates therefor at the office of the Company or of any transfer agent for
the Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the Company at such office that the holder elects to
convert the same. Such notice shall state the number of shares of Preferred Stock being converted and
shall state therein the holder's name or the name or names of the holder's nominees in which the holder
wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued. On the date of conversion,
all rights with respect to the Preferred Stock so converted shall terminate, except any of the rights of the
holder thereof, upon surrender of the holder's certificate or certificates therefor, to receive certificates for
the number of shares of Common Stock into which such Preferred Stock has been converted and cash in
an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends on, and aty and all other amounts owing with
respect to, the shares of Preferred Stock being converted to and including the time of conversion. If so
required by the Company, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by
written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Company, duly executed by the
registered holder or by the holders’ attorney duly authorized in writing. Upon the optional conversion of
the Preferred Stock, all shares of Preferred Stock being converted by any holder thereof shall be
aggregated for the purpose of determining the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder
shall be entitled, and no fractional share of Common Stock shall be issued. In lieu of any fractional share
to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the Company shall pay cash equal to such fraction

10
FROM CORPORATION TRUST WILM TEAM #2 (TUE) 14. 15°05 14:42/8T. 14:37/NO. 4865796374 P 12

multiplied by the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of conversion, as reasonably
determined by the Board of Directors in good faith. The Company shall, promptly after surrender of the
certificate or certificates for conversion, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock,
or to the holder's nominee or nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common
Stock to which the holder shall be entitled as aforesaid, together with cash in lieu of any fraction of a
share and cash in an amount equal to all dividends declared but unpaid thereon and any and all other
amounts owing with respect thereto at such time. Unless otherwise specified by the holder in the written
notice of conversion, such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close
of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person
or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion shall be treated for
all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date.

(c) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be
converted into shares of Common Stock at the Applicable Conversion Price then in effect, as the case
may be, upon the occurrence of either of the following:

(i) at any time upon the affirmative election of the holders of at least
seventy-five percent (75%) of the outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock (voting together as if a single
class on an as-converted basis and not as separate series), or

(ii) immediately upon the closing of the Company’s first firm
commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, covering the offer and sale of Common Stock for the account of the
Company at a price equal to or greater than three times (3x) the Original Issue Price for the Series D
Preferred Stock (as adjusted as provided herein) with aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of at least
$40 million before expenses (“Qualified Public Offering”).

(d) Mechanics of Automatic Conversions. Upon the occurrence of an event
specified in Section 6(c), the shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically without any
further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates representing such shares
are surrendered to the Company or its transfer agent; provided, however, that all holders of shares of
Preferred Stock being converted shall be given written notice of the occurrence of the event specified in
Section 6(c) triggering such conversion, including the date such event occurred (the “Mandatory
Conversion Date”), and the Company shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion unless certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred
Stock being converted are either delivered to the Company or its transfer agent, or the holder notifies the
Company or any transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen, or destroyed and executes an
agreement satisfactory to the Company to indemnify the Company from any loss meurred by it in
connection therewith. On the Mandatory Conversion Daie, all rights with respect to the shares of
Preferred Stock so converted shall terminate, except any of the rights of the holder thereof, upon
surrender of the holder's certificate or certificates therefor, to receive certificates for the number of shares
of Common Stock into which such Preferred Stock has been converted, together with cash in an amount
equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends on, and any and all other amounts owing with respect to, the
shares of Preferred Stock converted to and including the time of conversion. Upon the automatic
conversion of the shares of Preferred Stock, the holders of such shares shall surrender the certificates
representing such shares at the office of the Company or of its transfer agent. If 30 required by the
Company, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by written instrument

or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Company, duly executed by the registered holder or
by the holders’ attorney duly authorized in writing. Upon surrender of such certificates there shall be
issued and delivered to such holder, or to such holder’s nominee or nominees promptly at such office, a

11

certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Preferred
Stock surrendered were convertible on the date on which such automatic conversion occurred, together
with cash in an amount equal to all dividends declared but unpaid on, and any and all other amounts
owing with respect to, the shares of Preferred Stock converted to and including the time of conversion.
Upon the automatic conversion of the Preferred Stock, all shares of Preferred Stock being converted by
any holder thereof shall be aggregated for the purpose of determining the number of shares of Common
Stock to which such holder shall be entitled, and no fractional share of Common Stock shall be issued. In
lieu of any fractional share to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the Company shall pay cash
equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair market value of the Common Stock on the Mandatory
Conversion Date, as reasonably determined by the Board of Directors in good faith.

upon the original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and any

(1) In the case of Convertible Securities or
Options for Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common Stock issued were the shares of
Common Stock, if any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange
of such Convertible Securities and the consideration received therefor was the consideration actually
received by the Company for the issue of all such Options, whether or not exercised, plus the
consideration actually received by the Company upon such exercise, or for the issue of all such
Convertible Securities which were actually converted or exchanged, plus the additional consideration, if
any, actually received by the Company upon such conversion or exchange; and

(2) in the case of Options for Convertible
Securities only the Converlible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were issued at
the time of issue of such Options, and the consideration received by the Company for the Additional
Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been then issued was the consideration actually received by the

Stock on the original adjustment date, or (ii) the applicable Conversion Price of any such series of
Preferred Stock that would have resulted from any issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock

securities entitled to receive such dividend or distribution, or

business on the date immediately prior to the date upon which such corporate action becomes effective.

sale, then, forthwith upon such issue or sale, the applicable Conversion Price of a series of Preferred
Stock shall be reduced concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest hundredth of a
cent) determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of
shares which the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for the total number of Additional
Shares of Common so issued would purchase at such Conversion Price, and the denominator of which

number of such Additional Shares of Common so issued. For the purposes of this Subsection D.6(e)(iv),
all shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock and the
exercise and/or conversion of any other outstanding Convertible Securities and all outstanding Options
shall be deemed to be outstanding

Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any adjustment in Conversion Prices
hereunder, in the event that the percentage decrease in the Series A Conversion Price or Series B
Conversion Price is greater than the percentage decrease in the Series C Conversion Price, then the Series
A Conversion Price or the Series B Conversion Price, as applicable, shall instead be adjusted by an
amount equal to the percentage decrease in the Series C Conversion Price.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this Subsection
D.6(e), the consideration received by the Company for the issue (or deemed issue) of any Additional
Shares of Common Stock shall be computed as follows:

computed at the fair value thereof at the time of such issuc, as detcrmined in good faith by the Board of
Directors; and

(II]) in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock
are issued together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Company for consideration which
covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in clauses (A) and

(B) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per
share received by the Company for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued

pursuant to Subsection 6(e)(ii)(A), relating to Options and Convertible Securities, shall be determined by

of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional
consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained
therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration) payable to the Company upon the exercise of
such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for
Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, by (y) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set

the effectiveness of such deemed issuance, be proportionately decreased.

(B) Combinations or Consolidations, In the event the
outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined or consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise,
into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, the applicable Conversion Price of each series of
Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such combination or consolidation shall, concurrently with
the effectiveness of such combination or consolidation, be proportionately increased.

(f) Adjustments for Certain Dividends and Distributions. {n the event that at any
time or from time to time on or after the Filing Date the Company shall make or issue, or fix a record date
for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution
payable in securities of the Company other than shares of Common Stock or securities the issuance of
which are deemed to be issuances of Common Stock under Subsection D.6(e)(iii), then and in each such
event provision shall be made so that the holders of Preferred Stock of such series shall receive upon
conversion thereof in addition to the number of shares of Common Stock receivable thereupon, the
amount of securities of the Company that they would have received had their Preferred Stock been
converted into Common Stock immediately prior to such event and had they thereafter, during the period
from the date of such event to and including the conversion date, retained such securities receivable by
them as aforesaid during such period, giving application during such period to all adjustments called for
herein.

and (iii) the number of shares of Commion Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the
time would be received upon the conversion of each share of Preferred Stock.
