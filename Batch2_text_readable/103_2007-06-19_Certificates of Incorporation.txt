Corporation or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, into that number of fully-paid, nonassessable
shares of Common Stock determined by dividing the Original Issue Price for the relevant Series by the
Conversion Price for such series, The number of shares of Common Stock into which each share of
Preferred Stock of a series may be converted is hereinafter referred to as the “Conversfon Rafe” for cach
such series. Upon any decrease or increase in the Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock, as
described in this Section 4, the Conversion Rate for such series shall he appropriately increased or
decreased,

Automatic Conversion. Bach share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be
converted into fully-paid, non-assessable shares of Common Stock at the then effective Conversion Rate
for such share (i) immediately prior to the closing of a firm commitment underwritten initial public
offering pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the “Securities Aer”), covering the offer and sale of the Corporation's Common Stock, provided that the
offering price per share is not less than $12.75 (as adjusted for Recapitalizations) and the aggregate gross
proceeds to the Corporation are not less than $35,000,000 {a “Qualified IPO”), or Gi) upon the receipt by
the Corporation of a written request for such conversion from the holders of at least 80% of the Series C

specified in such requests (each of the events referred to in (i) and (ii) are referred to herein as an
“Automatic Conversion Event’).

(sc) Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of Common Stock shail be
issued upon conversion of Preferred Stock, In lien of any fractional shares to which the holder would
otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the then fair
market value of a share of Common Stock as determined by the Board of Directors. For such purpose, all
shares of Preferred Stock held by cach holder of Preferred Stock shall be aggregated, and any resulting
fractional share of Common Stock shall be paid in cash. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to convert the same into ful] shares of Common Stock, and to receive certificates therefor, he
shall either (A) surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the
Corporation or of any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock or (B) notify the Corporation or its transfer

-5-
SV 246761549 4
certificates, and shall give written notice to the Corporation at such office that he elects to convert the
same; provided, however, that on the date of an Automatic Conversion Bvent, the outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares
and whether or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its
transfer agent; provided further, however, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates
evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such Automatic Conversion Event unless either
the certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are delivered to the Corporation or its transfer
agent as provided above, or the halder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates
have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to
indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates. On the date
of the occurrence of an Automatic Conversion Event, each holder of record of shares of Preferred Stock
shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion,
notwithstanding that the certificates representing such shares of Preferred Stock shall not have been
surrendered at the office of the Corporation, that notice from the Corporation shall not have been received

by any holder of record of shares of Preferred Stock, or that the certificates evidencing such shares of

Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered to such holder.

The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after such delivery, or after such agreement and
indemnification, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which he shall be entitled as aforesaid and a
check payable to the holder in the amount of any cash amounts payable as the result of a conversion into
fractional shares of Common Stock, plus any declared and unpaid dividends on the converted Preferred
Stock. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on
the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons
entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for ail
purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date; provided,
however, that if the conversion is in connection with an underwritten offer of seourities registered
pursuant to the Securities Act or a merger, sale, financing, or liquidation of the Corporation or other
event, the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering Preferred Stock for conversion, be
conditioned upon the closing of such transaction or upon the occurrence of such event, in which case the
person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of the Preferred Stock.
shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such
transaction or the occurrence of such event.

respect thereto);

(3) no readjustment pursuant to clause (2) above shall have the
effect of increasing the Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock to an amount above the
Conversion Price that would have resulted from any other issuances of Additional Shares of Common and
any other adjustments provided for herein between the original adjustment date and such readjustment

issue of such Options, and the consideration recelved by the Corporation for the Additional Shares of
Common deemed to have been then issued was the consideration actually received by the Corporation for
the issue of such exercised Options, plus the consideration deemed to have been received by the
Corporation (determined pursuant to Section 4(d)(iv)) upon the issue of the Convertible Securities with

number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of
shares which the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for the total number of Additional
Shares of Common so issued would purchase at such Conversion Price, and the denominator of which
