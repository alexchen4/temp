B. Rights, Preferences _and Restrictions of Preferred Stock. The rights,
preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to and imposed on the Preferred Stock are as set
forth below in this Article IV(B).

1. Dividend Provisions.

(a) The holders of shares of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive
dividends, out of any assets legally available therefor, prior and in preference to any declaration
or payment of any dividend (payable other than in Common Stock or other securities and rights
convertible into or entitling the holder thereof to receive, directly or indirectly, additional shares
of Common Stock of this corporation) on the Common Stock of this corporation, at the
applicable Dividend Rate (as defined below), payable when, as and if declared by the Board of
Directors. Such dividends shall not be cumulative. For purposes of this subsection 1(a),
“Dividend Rate” shall mean $0.026667 per annum for each share of Series A Preferred Stock,
$0.158151 per annum for each share of Series B Preferred Stock and $0.24832 per annum for
each share of Series C Preferred Stock (each as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends,
combinations, subdivisions, recapitalizations or the like with respect to such series of Preferred
Stock).

(b) After payment of such dividends, any additional dividends or distributions
shall be distributed among all holders of Common Stock and Preferred Stock in proportion to the
number of shares of Common Stock that would be held by each such holder if all shares of
Preferred Stock were converted to Common Stock at the then effective conversion rate.

2. Liquidation Preference.

(a) In the event of any Liquidation Event (as defined below), either voluntary
or involuntary, the holders of each series of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, on a pari
passu basis and prior and in preference to any distribution of the assets of this corporation and

‘ the proceeds of such Liquidation Event (collectively, the Proceeds”) to the holders of Common
Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount per share equal to the sum of the
applicable Original Issue Price (as defined below) for such series of Preferred Stock, plus
declared but unpaid dividends on such share. If, upon the occurrence of such event, the Proceeds
thus distributed among the holders of the Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit the
payment to such holders of the full aforesaid preferential amounts, then the entire Proceeds
legally available for distribution shall be distributed ratably among the holders of the Preferred
Stock in proportion to the full preferential amount that each such holder is otherwise entitled to
receive under this subsection (a). For purposes of this Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, “Original Issue Price” shall mean $0.33334 per share for each share of the Series
A Preferred Stock, $1.97689 per share for each of share of Series B Preferred Stock and $3.104

GDSVF&EN837231.6 2
per share for each of share of Series C Preferred Stock (each as adjusted for any stock splits,
stock dividends, combinations, subdivisions, recapitalizations or the like with respect to such
series of Preferred Stock).

(b) Upon completion of the distribution required by subsection (a) of this
Section 2, all of the remaining Proceeds available for distribution to stockholders shall be
distributed among the holders of Common Stock pro rata based on the number of shares of
Common Stock held by each.

{c) Notwithstanding the above, for purposes of determining the amount each
holder of shares of Preferred Stock is entitled to receive with respect to a Liquidation Event, each
such holder of shares of a series of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have converted
(regardless of whether such holder actually converted) such holder’s shares of such series of
Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock immediately prior to the Liquidation Event if, as a
result of an actual conversion, such holder would receive, in the aggregate, an amount greater
than the amount that would be distributed to such holder if such holder did not convert such
holder’s shares of such series of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock. If any such
holder shall be deemed to have converted shares of Preferred Stock into Common Stock pursuant
to this paragraph, then such holder shall not be entitled to receive any distribution that would
otherwise be made to holders of Preferred Stock that have not converted (or have not been
deemed to have converted) into shares of Common Stock.

(I) @ For purposes of this Section 2, a “Liquidation Event” shall be
deemed to be occasioned by or to include (A) the closing of the sale, transfer or other
disposition, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of this
corporation’s assets, (B) the consummation of the merger or consolidation of this corporation, in
one transaction, or a series of related transactions, with or into another entity (except a merger or
consolidation in which the holders of capital stock of this corporation immediately prior to such
merger or consolidation continue to hold at least a majority of the voting power of the capital
stock of this corporation or the surviving or acquiring entity), (C) the closing of the transfer
(whether by merger, consolidation or in any other manner), in one transaction or a series of
related transactions to which this corporation is a party, to a person or group of affiliated persons
(other than an underwriter of this corporation’s securities), of this corporation’s securities if,
after such closing, such person or group of affiliated persons would hold 50% or more of the
outstanding voting stock of this corporation (or the surviving or acquiring entity), (D) the grant
of an exclusive and irrevocable license of the Company’s intellectual property to a third party or
(E) a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of this corporation; provided, however, that a
transaction shall not constitute a Liquidation Event if its sole purpose is to change the state of
this corporation’s incorporation, to create a holding company that will be owned in substantially
the same proportions by the persons who held this corporation’s securities immediately prior to
such transaction, or consolidate this corporation with a wholly owned subsidiary.
Notwithstanding the prior sentence, the sale of shares of capital stock in a financing transaction
in which this corporation is the surviving corporation shall not be deemed a “Liquidation Event.”

(ii) | In any Liquidation Event, if Proceeds received by this corporation
or its stockholders is other than cash, its value will be deemed its fair market value! (determined

GDSVF&H837231.6 3
by a majority of the Board of Directors, including the Series A Director (as defined below) and
the Series C Director (as defined below)). Any securities shall be valued as follows:

(A) Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar
restrictions on free marketability covered by (B) below:

(1) If traded on a securities exchange or through the
Nasdaq National Market, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the
securities on such exchange or system over the twenty (20) trading-day period ending three (3)
trading days prior to the closing of the Liquidation Event;

(2) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall
be deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the
twenty (20) trading-day period ending three (3) trading days prior to the closing of the
Liquidation Event; and

(3)  Ifthere is no active public market, the value shall be
the fair value thereof, as mutually determined by this corporation and the holders of a majority of
the voting power of all then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock.

(B) The method of valuation of securities subject to investment
letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of
a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount
from the market value determined as above in (A) (1), (2) or (3) to reflect the approximate fair
market value thereof, as mutually determined by this corporation and the holders of a majority of
the voting power of all then outstanding shares of such Preferred Stock.

(iii) In the event the requirements of this Section2 are not complied
with, this corporation shall forthwith either:

(A) cause the closing of such Liquidation Event to be
postponed until such time as the requirements of this Section 2 have been complied with; or

(B) cancel such transaction, in which event the rights,
preferences and privileges of the holders of the Preferred Stock shall revert to and be the same as
such rights, preferences and privileges existing immediately prior to the date of the first notice
referred to in subsection 2(d)(iv) hereof.

(iv) This corporation shall give each holder of record of Preferred
Stock written notice of such impending Liquidation Event not later than twenty (20) days prior to
the stockholders’ meeting called to approve such transaction, or twenty (20) days prior to the
closing of such transaction, whichever is earlier, and shall also notify such holders in writing of
the final approval of such transaction. The first of such notices shall describe the material terms
and conditions of the impending transaction and the provisions of this Section 2, and this
corporation shall thereafter give such holders prompt notice of any material changes. The
transaction shall in no event take place sooner than twenty (20) days after this corporation has
given the first notice proyided for herein or sooner than ten (10) days after this corporation has
given notice of any material changes provided for herein; provided, however, that subject to

GDSVF&HN837231.6 4
compliance with the General Corporation Law such periods may be shortened or waived upon
the written consent of the holders of Preferred Stock that represent a majority of the voting
power of all then outstanding shares of such Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class
and not as separate series, and on an as-converted basis).

3, Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion
tights as follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share, at the office
of this corporation or any transfer agent for such stock, into such number of fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the applicable Original
Issue Price for such series by the applicable Conversion Price for such series (the conversion rate
for a series of Preferred Stock into Common Stock is referred to herein as the “Conversion Rate”
for such series), determined as hereafter provided, in effect on the date the certificate is
surrendered for conversion. The initial Conversion Price per share for each series of Preferred
Stock shall be the Original Issue Price applicable to such series; provided, however, that the
Conversion Price for the Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in subsection
3(d).

(b) Automatic Conversion.

(i) Each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall automatically be
converted into shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Rate at the time in effect for such
Series A Preferred Stock immediately upon the date specified by written consent or agreement of
the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock (voting
together as a single class).

(ii) | Each share of Series B Preferred Stock shall automatically be
converted into shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Rate at the time in effect for such
Series B Preferred Stock immediately upon the date specified by written consent or agreement of
the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock (voting
together as a single class).

(iii) Each share of Series C Preferred Stock shall automatically be
converted into shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Rate at the time in effect for such
Series C Preferred Stock immediately upon the date specified by written consent or agreement of
the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock (voting

together as a single class).

(iv) Notwithstanding Sections 3(b)(i), 3(b)(ii) and 3(b){iii) above, each
share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the

GDSVF&H\837231.6 5
recapitalizations or the like) and $25,000,000 in the aggregate (before deduction of underwriters
commissions and expenses) (a “Qualified Public Offering’) or (y) the date specified by written
consent or agreement of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Preferred
Stock (voting together as a single class and not as separate series, and on an as-converted basis)
(provided, however, that with respect to a conversion pursuant to subsection (y): (1) the written
consent of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock (voting as a separate
class) will be required to cause a conversion in connection with any Liquidation Event in which
holders of Series B Preferred Stock would receive proceeds in such Liquidation Event of less
than $3.95378 for each share of Series B Preferred Stock then held by them (as adjusted for stock
splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations and the like), and (2) the written consent of a majority of
the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock (voting as a separate class) will be required to
cause a conversion in connection with any Liquidation Event in which holders of Series C

share of Series C Preferred Stock then held by them (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends,
recapitalizations and the like).

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to voluntarily convert the same into shares of Common Stock, he or she shall surrender
the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of this corporation or of any
transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to this corporation at its
principal corporate office, of the election to convert the same and shall state therein the name or
names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued. This
corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder
of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for
the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid. Such
conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the
date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons
entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated
for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock as of such date.
If the conversion is in connection with an underwritten offering of securities registered pursuant
to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the conversion may, at the option of any holder
tendering Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters
of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering, in which event the persons entitled to receive
the Common Stock upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have
converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities.
If the conversion is in connection with Automatic Conversion provisions of subsection 4(b)(ii)
above, such conversion shall be deemed to have been made on the conversion date described in
the stockholder consent approving such conversion, and the persons entitled to receive shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record
holders of such shares of Common Stock as of such date.

(d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock for Certain Dilutive
Issuances, Splits and Combinations. The Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock shall be
subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

below) without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Conversion Price
applicable to a series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such .
Additional Stock, the Conversion Price for such series in effect immediately prior to each such
issuance shall forthwith (except as otherwise provided in this clause (i)) be adjusted to a price
determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be
the number of shares of Common Stock Outstanding (as defined below) immediately prior to
such issuance plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration
received by this corporation for such issuance would purchase at such Conversion Price; and the
denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock Outstanding (as defined
below) immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock.

(A) No adjustment of the Conversion Price for the Preferred
Stock shall be made in an amount less than $0.001 per share, provided that any adjustments that
are not required to be made by reason of this sentence shall be carried forward and shall be either
taken into account in any subsequent adjustment made prior to three (3) years from the date of
the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward, or shall be made at the end of three
(3) years from the date of the’event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward. Except
to the limited extent provided for in subsections (D)(3) and (D)(4), no adjustment of such
Conversion Price pursuant to this subsection 3(d)(i) shall have the effect of increasing the
Conversion Price above the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment.

(B) In the case of the issuance of Additional Stock for cash, the
consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting any
reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by this
corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

(C) In the case of the issuance of the Additional Stock for a
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be
deemed to be the fair value thereof as determined by the Board of Directors irrespective of any

to subscribe for Common Stock, securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for

a consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in subsections
3(d)(i)(C) and (d)(i)(D)), if any, received by this corporation upon the issuance of such options
or rights plus the minimum exercise price provided in such options or rights (without taking into
account potential antidilution adjustments) for the Common Stock covered thereby.

rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Conversion Price of the

time after the Filing Date fix a record date for the effectuation of a split or subdivision of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock or the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled
to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock or other
securities or rights convertible into, or entitling the holder thereof to receive directly or
indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock (hereinafter referred to as “Common Stock
Equivalents”) without payment of any consideration by such holder for the additional shares of
Common Stock or the Common Stock Equivalents (including the additional shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof), then, as of such record date (or the date of
such dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no record date is fixed), the Conversion Price of
the Preferred Stock shall be appropriately decreased so that the number of shares of Common
Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shal] be increased in proportion to such
increase of the aggregate of shares of Common Stock outstanding and those issuable with respect
to such Common Stock Equivalents.

(iv) If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any time
after the Filing Date is decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of Common Stock,
then, following the record date of such combination, the Conversion Price for the Preferred Stock
shall be appropriately increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on
conversion of each share of such series shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in
outstanding shares.

(e) Other Distributions. In the event this corporation shall declare a
distribution payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by this
corporation or other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred

recapitalization of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision, combination or merger or sale

made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon
conversion of the Preferred Stock the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of
this corporation or otherwise, to which a holder of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion
would have been entitled on such recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall
be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 3 with respect to the rights of the
holders of the Preferred Stock after the recapitalization to the end that the provisions of this
Section 3 (including adjustment of the Conversion Price then in effect and the number of shares
purchasable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event as nearly
equivalently as may be practicable.

GDS VF&H\837231.6
(g) No Fractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments.

share or shares of the Preferred Stock and the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock to
be issued to particular stockholders, shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share and the
corporation shall pay in cash the fair market value of any fractional shares as of the time when
entitlement to receive such fractions is determined. Whether or not fractional shares would be
issuable upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of
Preferred Stock the holder is at the time converting into Common Stock and the number of
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion.

; (ii) | Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the
Conversion Price of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 3, this corporation, at its expense,
shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and
prepare and furnish to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment
or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is
based. This corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of Preferred
Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (A) such
adjustment and readjustment, (B) the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock at the
time in effect, and (C) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other
property that at the time would be received upon the conversion of a share of Preferred Stock.

record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof
who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend) or other distribution or to
receive any other right, this corporation shall mail to each holder of Preferred Stock, at least
twenty (20) days prior to the date specified therein, a notice specifying the date on which any
such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or right, and the amount
and character of such dividend, distribution or right.

(i) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. This corporation shall at
all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock,
solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock, such
number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, in addition to such other remedies as shall
be available to the holder of such Preferred Stock, this corporation will take such corporate

of such series of Preferred Stock.

4, Voting Rights.

(a) General Voting Rights. The holder of each share of Preferred Stock shall
have the right to one vote for each share of Common Stock into which such Preferred Stock

accordance with the Bylaws of this corporation, and except as provided in subsection 4(b) below
with respect to the election of directors by the separate class vote of the holders of Common
Stock, shall be entitled to vote, together with holders of Common Stock, with respect to any
question upon which holders of Common Stock have the right to vote. Fractional votes shall not,
however, be permitted and any fractional voting rights available on an as-converted basis (after
aggregating all shares into which shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder could be
converted) shall be rounded to the nearest whole number (with one-half being rounded upward).

(b) Voting for the Election of Directors. As long as a majority of the shares of
Series A Preferred Stock originally issued remain outstanding, the holders of such shares of
Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to elect one (1) director of this corporation at any
election of directors (the “Series A Director”). As long as a majority of the shares of Series C
Preferred Stock originally issued remain outstanding, the holders of such shares of Series C
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to elect one (1) director of this corporation at any election of
directors (the “Series C Director”). The holders of outstanding Common Stock shall be entitled

Corporation Law, any vacancy, including newly created directorships resulting from any
increase in the authorized number of directors or amendment of this Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, and vacancies created by removal or resignation of a director, may
be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, though less than a quorum, or by a sole
remaining director, and the directors so chosen shall hold office until the next annual election
and until their successors are duly elected and shall qualify, unless sooner displaced; provided,
however, that where such vacancy occurs among the directors elected by the holders of a class or
series of stock, the holders of shares of such class or series may override the Board's action to fill
such vacancy by (i) voting for their own designee to fill such vacancy at a meeting of the
Company’s stockholders or (ii) written consent, if the consenting stockholders hold a sufficient
number of shares to elect their designee at a meeting of the stockholders. Any director may be
removed during his or-her term of office, either with or without cause, by, and only by, the

GDS VF&HN\83723 1.6 12
affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of the class or series of stock entitled to elect such
director or directors, given either at a special meeting of such stockholders duly called for that
purpose or pursuant to a written consent of stockholders, and any vacancy thereby created may
be filled by the holders of that class or series of stock represented at the meeting or pursuant to
written consent.
