Directors, out of any assets at the time legally available therefor, at the Dividend Rate specified tor
such series of Preferred Stock, payable in preference and priority to any declaration or payment of
any Distribution on Common Stock of the Corporation in such calendar year. No Distributions shall
be made with respect to the Common Stock until all declared dividends on the Preferred Stock have
been paid or set aside for payment to the Preferred Stock holders. Payment of any dividends to the
holders of the Preferred Stock shall be on a pro rata, pari passu basis in proportion to the Dividend
Rate specified for such series of Preferred Stock. The right to receive dividends on shares of
Preferred Stock shall not be cumulative, and no right to such dividends shall accrue to holders of
Preferred Stock by reason of the fact that dividends on said shares are not declared or paid tn any
calendar year.
(b) Additional Dividends. After the payment or setting aside for payment of the
dividends described in Section 2(a), any additional dividends (other than dividends on Common
Stock payable solely in Common Stock) declared or paid in any fiscal year shall be declared or paid
among the holders of the Preferred Stock and Common Stock then outstanding in proportion to the
greatest whole number of shares of Common Stock which would be held by each such holder if all

(c} Non-Cash Distributions. Whenever a Distribution provided for in this

including the consent of the majority of the Preferred Directors (as defined in paragraph 5(d)).

(d) Consent to Certain Distributions. As authorized by Section 402.5(c) of the
California Corporations Code, if Section 502 or Section 503 of the California Corporations Code is
applicable to a payment made by the Corporation, then such applicable section or sections shall not
apply if such payment is a payment made by the Corporation in connection with (i) repurchases of
Common Stock issued to or held by employees, officers, directors or consultants of the Corporation
or its subsidiarics at cost upon termination of their employment or services pursuant to agreements
providing for the right of said repurchase, (11) repurchases of Common Stock issued to or held by
employees, officers, directors or consultants of the Corporation or its subsidiaries pursuant to rights
of first refusal contained in agreements providing for such right or (11) any other repurchase or
redemption of Common Stock or Preferred Stock approved by the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock.

3, Liguidation Rights.

(a) Liquidation Preference. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation, cither voluntary or involuntary, the holders of the Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to receive, on a pari passu basis and prior and in preference to any Distribution of
any of the assets of the Corporation to the holders of the Common Stock by reason of their
ownership of such stock, an amount per share for each share of Preferred Stock held by them equal
to the sum of (i) the Liquidation Preference specified for such share of Preferred Stock and (11) all
declared but unpaid dividends (if any) on such share of Preferred Stock. If upon the liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the assets of the Corporation legally available for
distribution to the holders of the Preferred Stock are insufficient to permit the payment to such
holders of the full amounts specified in this Section 3{a), then the entire assets of the Corporation
legally available for distribution shall be distributed with equal priority and pro rata among the
holders of the Preferred Stock in proportion to the full amounts they would otherwise be entitled to
receive pursuant to this Section 3{a).

(b) Remaining Assets. After the payment to the holders of Preferred Stock of the
full preferential amounts specified above, the entire remaining assets of the Corporation !cgally
available for distribution by the Corporation shall be distributed with equal priority and pro rata
among the holders of the Preferred Stock and Common Stock in proportion to the number of shares

4.
of Common Stock held by them, with the shares of Preferred Stock being treated for this purpose as
if they had been converted to shares of Common Stock at the then applicable Conversion Rate.

(c) Treatment of Preferred Stock in any Distribution. Notwithstanding anything
in this Section 3 to the contrary, if upon any Liquidation Transaction (as defined below) a holder of
Preferred Stock would receive a greater Distribution by converting such holder’s shares of Preferred
Stock into Common Stock than such holder would be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3(a) or
3(b) as a holder of Preferred Stock, then such holder shall not receive any amounts under such
subscctions as a holder of Preferred Stock, but shall be treated, for the purposes of determining such
holder’s rights under Sections 3(a) or 3(b) only, as though such holder held, in addition to any shares
of Common Stock then actually held by such holder, such number of shares of Common stock that
such holder would hold if such holder had then converted such holder’s shares of Preferred Stock
into Common Stock, effective immediately prior to the Liquidation Transaction, at the then
applicable Conversion Rate (as defined below). For the avoidance of doubt, however, in no event
shall any holder of Preferred Stock be entitled to convert its shares of Preferred Stock in order to
participate in any Distribution, or series of Distributions, as shares of Common Stock, without first
foregoing participation in the Distribution, or series of Distributions, as shares of Preferred Stock.

(d) Reorganization. For purposes of this Section 3, a liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation shall be decmed to be occasioned by, or to include, (1) the acquisition
of the Corporation by another entity by means of any transaction or series of related transactions
(including, without limitation, any stock acquisition, reorganization, merger or consolidation but
excluding any sale of stock for capital raising purposes) other than a transaction or scries of
transactions in which the holders of the voting securities of the Corporation outstanding immediately
prior to such transaction continue to retain (either by such voting securities remaining outstanding or
by such voting securities being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity), without one
or more holder’s ownership relative to the other holders increasing or decreasing materially after
such transaction or series of transactions, as a result of shares in the Corporation held by such
holders prior to such transaction, at least fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power represented by
the voting securities of the Corporation or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such
transaction or series of transactions; (ii) a sale, lease, assignment, transfer or other conveyance of, or
the grant of an irrevocable and exclusive license to, all or substantially all of the assets of the
Corporation, including, without limitation, an exclusive license to the Company’s source code for its
primary product offerings in one or a series of transactions; or (iil) any liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, (each such transaction, a
“Liquidation Transaction”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holders of a majority of the then
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock may waive the treatment of a Liquidation Transaction as a
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation.

(ec) Valuation of Non-Cash Consideration. If any assets of the Corporation
distributed to stockholders in connection with any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the
Corporation are other than cash, then the value of such assets shall be their fair market value as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, including the consent of a majority of the
Preferred Directors; provided, however, that any publicly-traded securities to be distributed to

-5-
stockholders in a liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation shall be valued as
follows:

(i) If the securities are then traded on a national securities
exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market (or a similar national quotation system), then the value of the
securities shal! be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange
or system over the ten (10) trading day period ending five (5) trading days prior to the Distribution:

(ii) if the securities are actively traded over-the-counter, then the
value of the securities shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid prices of the securities
over the ten (10) trading day period ending five (5) trading days prior to the Distribution.

In the event of a merger or other acquisition of the Corporation by another entity, the
Distribution date shall be deemed to be the date such transaction closes.

For the purposes of this subsection 3(e), “trading day” shall mean any day which the
exchange or system on which the securities to be distributed are traded is open and “closing prices”
or “closing bid prices” shall be deemed to be: (i) for securities traded primarily on the New York
Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market, the last reported trade
price or sale price, as the case may be, at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on that day and (11) for
securities listed or traded on other exchanges, markets and systems, the market price as of the end of
the regular hours trading period that is generally accepted as such for such exchange, market or
system. If, after the date hereof, the benchmark times generally accepted in the securities industry
for determining the market price of a stock as of a given trading day shall change from those set
forth above, the fair market value shall be determined as of such other generally accepted benchmark
times.

4. Conversion. The holders of Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as follows
(the “Conversion Rights’):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the
option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share at the office of the
Corporation or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, into that number of fully-paid,
nonassessable shares of Common Stock determined by dividing the Original Issue Price for the
relevant series of Preferred Stock by the Conversion Price for such scries. (The number of shares of
Common Stock into which each share of Preferred Stock may be converted is hereinafter referred to
as the “Conversion Rate’’.) Upon any decrease or increase in the Conversion Price specified for the
relevant series of Preferred Stock, as described in this Section 4, the Conversion Rate for such series
shall be appropriately increased or decreased.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be
converted into fully-paid, non-assessable shares of Common Stock at the then effective Conversion
Rate specified for such series of Preferred Stock (1) immediately prior to the closing ofa firm
commitment underwritten initial public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement filed
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act’’), covering the offer and sale of

-6-
the Corporation’s Common Stock, provided that the aggregate gross proceeds to the Corporation are
not less than $30,000,000 (before deduction of underwriters commissions and expenses) (a
“Qualified Offering”), or (11) upon the receipt by the Corporation of a written request for such
conversion from the holders of a majority of the Preferred Stock then outstanding, or, if later, the
effective date for conversion specified in such requests (each of the events referred to in (i) and (11)
are referred to herein as an ‘“‘Automatic Conversion Event”).

{c) Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be
issued upon conversion of the Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder
would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the
then fair market value of a share of Common Stock as determined by the Board of Directors. For
such purpose, all shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder of Preferred Stock shall be
aggregated, and any resulting fractional share of Common Stock shall be paid in cash. Before any
holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into full shares of Common Stock, and
to receive certificates therefor, he shall either (i) surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly
endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock or
(ii) notify the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or
destroyed and execute an agreement reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the
Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates, and shall give written
notice to the Corporation at such office that he elects to convert the same; provided, however, that on
the date of an Automatic Conversion Event, the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be
converted automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not
the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent;
provided further, however, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing
the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such Automatic Conversion Event unless either the
certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are delivered to the Corporation or its transfer
agent as provided above, or the holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such
certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement reasonably satisfactory to
the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such
certificates. On the date of the occurrence of an Automatic Conversion Event, each holder of record
of shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion, notwithstanding that the certificates representing such shares of
Preferred Stock shall not have been surrendered at the office of the Corporation, that notice from the
Corporation shall not have been received by any holder of record of shares of Preferred Stock, or
that the certificates evidencing such shares of Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered to
such holder.

The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after such delivery, or after such agreement and
indemnification, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as
aforesaid and a check payable to the holder in the amount of any cash amounts payable as the result
of a conversion into fractional shares of Common Stock, plus any declared and unpaid dividends on
the relevant series of converted Preferred Stock. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been
made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of

-7-
Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common
Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders
of such shares of Common Stock on such date; provided, however, that if the conversion is in
connection with an underwritten offer of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act or a
merger, sale, financing, or liquidation of the Corporation or other Liquidation Transaction, the
conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned
upon the closing of such transaction or upon the occurrence of such event, in which case the
person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of Preferred Stock
shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of
such transaction or the occurrence of such event.

(d) Adjustments to Conversion Price for Diluting Issues.

(1) Special Definition. For purposes of this paragraph 4(d),
“Additional Shares of Common” shall mean all shares of Common Stock issued (or, pursuant to
paragraph 4(d)(iii), deemed to be issued) by the Corporation after the Effective Date, other than
issuances or deemed issuances of:

(1) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable to officers,
directors and employees of, or consultants to, the Corporation pursuant to stock grants, option plans,
purchase plans or other employee stock incentive programs or arrangements approved by the Board
of Directors, including the consent of a majority of the Preferred Directors (as defined 1n Section
5(d) below), or upon cxercise of options or warrants granted to such parties pursuant to any such
plan or arrangement;

(2) shares of Common Stock issued upon the exercise or
conversion of Options or Convertible Securities outstanding as of the Effective Date;

(3) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable as a

pursuant to paragraph 4(c), 4(f) or 4(g) hereof;

(4) shares of Common Stock issued in a Qualified
Offering;

(5) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable pursuant to
the acquisition of another corporation by the Corporation by merger, purchase of stock, purchase of
substantially all of the assets or other reorganization or to a joint venture agreement, provided that
such issuances are approved by the Board of Directors, including the consent of a majority of the
Preferred Directors;

(6) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable to banks,
equipment lessors or other financial institutions pursuant to a debt financing or commercial Icasing
transaction that is not effected primarily for capital raising purposes and that is approved by the
Board of Directors, including the consent of a majority of the Preferred Directors,

-8-
(7) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable in
connection with any settlement of any action, suit, proceeding or litigation approved by the Board of
Directors, including the consent of a majority of the Preferred Directors;

(8) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable in
connection with sponsored research, collaboration, technology license, development, OEM,
marketing or other similar strategic agreements or strategic partnerships approved by the Board of
Directors, including the consent of a majority of the Preferred Directors; and

(9) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable to suppliers
or third party service providers in connection with the provision of goods or services pursuant to
transactions approved by the Board of Directors, including the consent of a majority of a majority of
the Preferred Directors.

(ii) Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common. In the event
the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Effective Date shall issue any Options or
Convertible Securities or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of
securities entitled to receive any such Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum number
of shares (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto without regard to any provisions contained
therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of
such Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities, the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities or, in the case of Options for Convertible Sccurities, the exercise of such
Options and the conversion or exchange of the underlying securities, shall be deemed to have been
issued as of the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close
of business on such record date, provided that in any such case in which shares are deemed to be
issued:

(1) no further adjustment in the Conversion Price specified
for the relevant series of Preferred Stock shall be made upon the subsequent issue of Convertible
Securities or shares of Common Stock in connection with the exercise of such Options or conversion
or exchange of such Convertible Securities;

(2) if such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms
provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any change in the consideration payable to the
Corporation or in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or
exchange thereof (other than a change pursuant to the anti-dilution provisions of such Options or
Convertible Securities such as this Section 4(d) or pursuant to Recapitalization provisions of such
Options or Convertible Securities such as Sections 4(e), 4(f) and 4(g) hercof), the Conversion Price
specified for the relevant series of Preferred Stock and any subsequent adjustments based thereon
shall be recomputed to reflect such change as if such change had been in effect as of the original
issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of the record date with respect thereto);

(3) no readjustment pursuant to clause (2) above shal] have
the effect of increasing the Conversion Price specified for the relevant series of Preferred Stock to an
amount above the Conversion Price for such series that would have resulted from any other

-9-
issuances of Additional Shares of Common and any other adjustments provided for herein between
the original adjustment date and such readjustment date;

(4) upon the expiration of any such Options or any rights of
conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have been exercised, the
Conversion Price specified for the relevant series of Preferred Stock computed upon the original
issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto) and any subsequent
adjustments based thereon shall, upon such expiration, be recomputed as if:

(a) in the case of Convertible Securities or Options for
Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common issued were the shares of Common Stock, if
any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities and the consideration received therefor was the consideration actually
received by the Corporation for the issue of such exercised Options plus the consideration actually
received by the Corporation upon such exercise or for the issue of all such Convertible Securities
which were actually converted or exchanged, plus the additional consideration, if any, actually
received by the Corporation upon such conversion or exchange, and

(b) in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, only the
Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were issued at the time of
issue of such Options, and the consideration received by the Corporation for the Additional Shares of
Common deemed to have been then issued was the consideration actually received by the
Corporation for the issue of such exercised Options, plus the consideration decmed to have been
received by the Corporation (determined pursuant to Section 4(d)(iv)) upon the issue of the
Convertible Securities with respect to which such Options were actually exercised; and

(5) if such record date shall have been fixed and such
Options or Convertible Securitics are not issued on the date fixed therefor, the adjustment previously
made in the Conversion Price specified for the relevant series of Preferred Stock which became
effective on such record date shall be canceled as of the close of business on such record date, and
thereafter such Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this paragraph 4(d)(11) as of the actual
date of their issuance.

(ili) Adjustment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional
Shares of Common. In the event this Corporation shal! issue Additional Shares of Common
(including Additional Shares of Common deemed to be issued pursuant to paragraph 4(d)(1i))
without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the applicable Conversion Price
specified for the relevant serics of Preferred Stock in effect on the date of and immediately prior to
such issue, then, such Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price
(calculated to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the
numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior
to such issue plus the number of shares which the aggregate consideration received by the
Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of Common so issued would purchase at such
Conversion Price, and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of such Additional Shares of Common

-10-
so issued. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Conversion Price specified for the relevant series of
Preferred Stock shall not be reduced at such time if the amount of such reduction would be less than
$0.01, but any such amount shall be carried forward, and a reduction will be made with respect to
such amount at the time of, and together with, any subsequent reduction which, together with such
amount and any other amounts so carried forward, equal $0.01 or more in the aggregate. For the
purposes of this Subsection 4(d)(iii), all shares of outstanding Common Stock, as well as all shares
of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock and the
exercise and/or conversion of any other outstanding Convertible Securities and all outstanding
Options shall be deemed to be outstanding.

(iv) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this
subsection 4(d), the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue (or deemed issue) of any
Additional Shares of Common shall be computed as follows:

(1) Cash and Property. Such consideration shall:

(a) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the aggregate
amount of cash received by the Corporation before deducting any reasonable discounts,
commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the Corporation for any underwriting or
otherwise in connection with such issuance;

(b) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair market value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors, including the consent of a majority of the Preferred Directors; and

(c) in the event Additional Shares of Common are issued
together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for consideration which
covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in clauses (a)
and (b) above, as reasonably determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, including the
consent of a majority of the Preferred Directors.

(2) Options and Convertible Securities. Whe consideration
per share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common deemed to have been issued
pursuant to paragraph 4(d)(ii) shall be determined by dividing

(x) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Corporation as
consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the minimum aggregate
amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to
any provision containcd therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration) payable to the
Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options for
Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securitics by

(y) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set forth in the
instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent

-}1-
adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities.

(ec) Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of Common Stock. In the
event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided (by stock split, by payment of a

stock dividend or otherwise) into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion
Price of each series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall,
concurrently with the effectiveness of such subdivision, be proportionately decreased. In the event
the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined (by reclassification or otherwise) into a
lesser number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock in
effect immediately prior to such combination shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such
combination, be proportionately increased.

(f} Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of Preferred Stock. In the
event the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock or any series of Preferred Stock shall be subdivided

(by stock split, by payment of a stock dividend or otherwise), into a greater number of shares of
Preferred Stock, the Dividend Rate, Original Issue Price and Liquidation Preference of the affected
series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall, concurrently with the
effectiveness of such subdivision, be proportionately decreased. In the event the outstanding shares
of Preferred Stock or any series of Preferred Stock shall be combined (by reclassification or
otherwise) into a lesser number of shares of Preferred Stock, the Dividend Rate, Original Issue Price
and Liquidation Preference of the affected series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to
such combination shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination, be proportionately
increased.

(g) Adjustments for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. If the Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock or a series of Preferred Stock shall be changed

into the same or a different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock, whether by
capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of
shares provided for above or pursuant to a Liquidation Transaction), then, in any such event, in licu
of the number of shares of Common Stock which the holders would otherwise have been entitled to
receive, each holder of the affected series of Preferred Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert
such shares of Preferred Stock into a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock which a
holder of the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of such scrics of
Preferred Stock immediately before that change would have been entitled to receive in such
reorganization or reclassification, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein with respect to
such other shares.

(h) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of a Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation at its expense shall
promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish
to each holder of the affected series of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or
readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based.

-12-
or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and
readjustments, (ii) the Conversion Price at the time in effect for such Preferred Stock and (iii) the
number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time
would be received upon the conversion of such Preferred Stock.

(1) Waiver of Adjustment of Conversion Price. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary in this Section 4, any downward adjustment of the Conversion Price of any series of

outstanding shares of such series of Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, either before or after
the issuance causing such adjustment.

(j) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at all
times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock solely

for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of Preferred Stock, such number of its
shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of
its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such
number of shares as shall be sufticient for such purpose.

incorporation or through any reorganization, recapitalization, transfer of assets, consolidation,

the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the
Corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this
Section 4 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect
the conversion rights of the holders of Preferred Stock against impairment. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Section 4(k) shall prohibit the Corporation from amending its Certificate
of Incorporation in accordance with applicable law and with the requisite consent of its stockholders
and the Board of Directors.
