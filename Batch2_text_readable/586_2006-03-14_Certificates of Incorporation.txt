5. CONVERSION RIGHTS.

The holders of the Serics Preferred shall have the following nghts with respect to the
conversion of the Serics Preferred into shares of Common Stock (the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Optional Conversion. Subject to and in compliance with the
provisions of this Section 5, any shares of Series Preferred may, at the option of the holder, be
converted at any time into fully-paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock. The number
of shares of Common Stock to which a holder of Series Preferred shall be entitled upon
conversion shall be the product obtained by multiplying the applicable ‘“‘Scrics Preferred
Conversion Rate” then in effect (determined as provided in Section 5(b) below) by the number of
shares of Series Preferred being converted.

(b) Series Preferred Conversion Rate. The conversion rate in effect
at any time for conversion of the Series Preferred (the “Series Preferred Conversion Rate”) shall
be the quotient obtained by dividing the applicable Original Issue Price of the Series Preferred by
the applicable ‘Series Preferred Conversion Price,” calculated as provided in subsection (c) of
this Section 5 below.

(c) Series Preferred Conversion Price. The conversion price for the
Series Preferred shall initially be the applicable Original Issue Price of the Series Preferred (the
“Series Preferred Conversion Price”). Such initial Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be
adjusted from time to time in accordance with this Section 5. All references to the Series
Preferred Conversion Price herein shall mean the Series Preferred Conversion Price as so
adjusted.

(d) Mechanics of Conversion. Each holder of Series Preferred who
dcsires to convert the same into shares of Common Stock pursuant to this Section 5 shall
surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Company or
any transfer agent for the Series Preferred, and shall give written notice to the Company at such
office that such holder elects to convert the same. Such notice shall state the series and number
of shares of Scrics Preferred being converted. Thereupon, the Company shall promptly issue and

LIBC/2679310
deliver at such office to such holder a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled and shall promptly pay (i) in cash or, to the
extent sufficient funds are not then legally available therefor, in Common Stock (at the Common
Stock’s fair market value determined by the Board as of the date of such conversion), any
declared and unpaid dividends on the shares of Series Preferred being converted and (ii) in cash
(at the Common Stock’s fair market value determined by the Board as of the date of conversion)
the valuc of any fractional share of Common Stock otherwise issuable to any holder of Series
Preferred. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made at the close of business on the
date of such surrender of the certificates represcnting the shares of Series Preferred to be
converted, and the person entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such
conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such shares of Common Stock
on such date.

(e) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If at any time
or from time to time after the date un which the first share of Scries C Preferred is issued (the
“Original Issue Date’), the Company effects a subdivision of the outstanding Common Stock
without a corresponding subdivision of the Preferred Stock, the Series Preferred Conversion
Price in effect immediately before that subdivision shall be proportionately decreased.
Conversely, if at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date the Company
combines the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares without a
corresponding combination of the Preferred Stock, the Series Preferred Conversion Price in
effect immediately before the combination shall be proportionately increased. Any adjustment
under this Section S(e) shall become effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision
or combination becomes effective.

(f) Adjustment for Common Stock Dividends and Distributions.
If at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date the Company pays a dividend or
other distribution in additional shares of Common Stock on shares of Common Stock and no
such dividend or distribution is made on shares of Series Preferred, the applicable Series
Preferred Conversion Price that is then in effect shall be decreased as of the time of such
issuance, as provided below:

(i) The applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be
adjusted by multiplying the Series Preferred Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction equal
to:

(A) | the numerator of which is the total number of shares
of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance, and

(B) the denominator of which is the total number of
shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance
plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or
distribution;

(ii) If the Company fixes a record date to determine which
holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution, the Series

LIBC/2679310
Preferred Conversion Price shall be fixed as of the close of business on such record date and the
number of shares of Common Stock shall be calculated immediately prior to the close of
business on such record date; and

(iii) If such record date is fixed and such dividend is not fully
paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the applicable Series
Preferred Conversion Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such
record date and thereafter the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be adjusted
pursuant to this Section 5(f) to reflect the actual payment of such dividend or distribution.

(g) Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. If
at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date, the Common Stock issuable upon
the conversion of the Series Preferred is changed into the same or a different number of shares of
any class or classes of stock, whether by recapitalization, reclassification or otherwise (other than
an Acquisition or Asset Transfer as defined in Section 4 above or a subdivision or combination
of shares or stock dividend or a reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale of assets provided
for elsewherc in this Section 5), in any such event each holder of Series Preferred shall then have
the right to convert such stock into the kind and amount of stock and other securities and
property receivabie upon such recapitalization, reclassification or other change by holders of the
maximum number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series Preferred could
have been converted immediately prior to such recapitalization, reclassification or change, all
subject to further adjustment as provided herein or with respect to such other securities or
property by the terms thereof.

(h) Reorganizations, Mergers or Consolidations. If at any time or
from time to time after the applicable Original Issue Date, there is a capital reorganization of the
Common Stock or the merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another corporation
or another entity or person (other than an Acquisition or Asset Transfer as defined in Section 4
above or a recapitalization, subdivision, combination, reclassification, exchange or substitution
of shares provided for elsewhere in this Section 5), as a part of such capital reorganization,
provision shall be made so that the holders of the Series Preferred shall thereafter be entitled to
receive upon conversion of the Series Preferred the number of shares of stock or other securities
or property of the Company to which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock
deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled on such capital reorganization, subject to
adjustment in respect of such stock or securities by the terms thereof. In any such case,
appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 5 with
respect to the rights of the holders of Series Preferred after the capital reorganization to the end
that the provisions of this Section 5 (including adjustment of the applicable Series Preferred
Conversion Price then in effect and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Series
Preferred) shall be applicable after that cvent and be as nearly equivalent as practicable.

(i) Sale of Shares Below Series Preferred Conversion Price.
(i) If at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue

Date, the Company issues or sells, or is deemed by the express provisions of this Section 5(i) to
have issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock (as defined below), other than as

10

below) less than the then effective Series Preferred Conversion Price of any class of Series
Preferred, threr-andin each such case, the then existing Series Preferred Conversion Price with
respect to shares of such class of Series Preferred shall be reduced, as of the opening of business
on the date of such issue or sale, to such lower Effective Price

Se

(ii) | No adjustment shall be made to the Series Preferred
Conversion Pricc in an amount less than one cent per share. Any adjustment otherwise required
by this Section 5(i) that is not required to be made due to the preceding sentence shall be
included in any subsequent adjustment to the Series Preferred Conversion Price.

(iii) For the purpose of making any adjustment required under
this Section 5(i), the aggregate consideration received by the Company for any issue or sale of
securities (the ‘Aggregate Consideration’) shall be defined as: (A) to the extent it consists of
cash, be computed at the net amount of cash received by the Company after deduction of any
underwriting or similar commissions, compensation or concessions paid or allowed by the
Company in connection with such issue or sale but without deduction of any expenses payable by
the Company, (B) to the extent it consists of property other than cash, be computed at the fair
value of that property as determined in good faith by the Board, and (C) if Additional Shares of
Common Stock, Convertible Securities (as defined below) or rights or options to purchase either
Additional Shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities are issued or sold together with
other stuck or securities or other assets of the Company for a consideration which covers both, be
computed as the portion of the consideration so received that may be reasonably determined in
good faith by the Board to be allocable to such Additional Shares of Common Stock, Convertible
Securities or rights or options.

(iv) For the purpose of the adjustment required under this
Section 5(i), if the Company issues or sells (x) Preferred Stock or other stock, options, warrants,
purchase rights or other securities convertible into, Additional Shares of Common Stock (such
convertible stock or securities being herein referred to as “Convertible Securities’’) or (y) rights
or options for the purchase of Additional Sharcs of Common Stock or Convertible Securities and
if the Effective Price of such Additional Shares of Common Stock is less than the Series
Preferred Conversion Price, in each case the Company shall be deemed to have issued at the time
of the issuance of such rights or options or Convertible Securities the maximum number of
Additional Shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise or conversion thereof and to have
received as consideration for the issuance of such shares an amount equal to the total amount of
the consideration, if any, received by the Company for the issuance of such rights or options or
Convertible Securities plus:

(A) _ in the case of such rights or options, the minimum
amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon the exercise of such rights or
options;

(B) in the case of Convertible Securities, the minimum
amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon the conversion thereof (other
than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities);

1]
LIBC/2679310
provided that if the minimum amounts of such consideration cannot be ascertained, but are a
function of antidilution or similar protective clauses, the Company shall be deemed to have

received for issuing or selling the Convertible Securities actually converted, plus the
consideration, if any, actually received by the Company (other than by cancellation of liabilities
or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities) on the conversion of such Convertible
Securities, provided that such readjustment shall not apply to prior conversions of Series

Company (before underwriting discounts, commissions and fees) are at least Thirty Million
Dollars ($30,000,000.00) (a “Qualified Public Offering”). Upon such automatic conversion, any

of this Section 5 above.

(ii) Each share of Junior Preferred shall automatically be
converted into shares of Common Stock, based on the then-effective applicable Series Preferred
Conversion Price, at any time upon the affirmative election of the holders of at least seventy
percent (70%) of the outstanding shares of the Junior Preferred, voting together as a single class

subsections (1)(i) and (1)(ii) of Section 5 above, the outstanding shares of the applicable Series
Preferred shall be converted automatically without any further action by the holders of such
shares and whether or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the
Company or its transfer agent; provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to
issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion unless

14
LIBC’2679310
such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the
Company to indemnify the Company from any loss incurred by it in connection with such
certificates. Upon the occurrence of such automatic conversion of the applicable Series

share, pay cash equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by the Common Stock’s fair
market value (as determined by the Board) on the date of conversion.

conversion of all outstanding shares of the Series Preferred. If at any time the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all then outstanding shares of the Series Preferred, the Company will take such corporate
action as may, in the opinion of its counsel. be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.
