dividends, out of any assets legally available therefor, prior and in preference to any declaration or
payment of any dividend (payable other than in Common Stock or other securities and rights
convertible into or entitling the holder thereof to receive, directly or indirectly, additional shares of

if declared by the Board. From the Series D Original Issue Date until the fifth anniversary of the
Series D Original Issue Date, the right to dividends on shares of Series C-1 Preferred shall not be
cumulative, and no right shall accrue to holders of any shares because dividends on such shares are
not declared or paid in any prior period, nor shall any undeclared or unpaid dividend with respect to
such period bear or accrue interest. With respect to any shares of Series C-] Preferred that have not
been converted to Common Stock by the fifth anniversary of the Series D Orginal Issue Date,
dividends upon such shares of Series C-1 Preferred shall begin to accumulate from the date of the
fifth anniversary of the Series D Original Issue Date, calculated monthly in arrears and prorated on a
daily basis for periods of less than one month. If, after the date of the fifth anniversary of the Series
D Original Issue Date, a share of Series C-1 Preferred is outstanding for less than a full month, the
dividends shall accumulate for that month on a pro rata basis based on the number of days that such
Series C-1 Preferred was outstanding during that month. Upon conversion of the Series C-]
Preferred pursuant to Section 4(a) or (b) of this Article IV, an amount equal to all dividends declared
or accumulated but unpaid shall be payable (i) in shares of Common Stock at the Series C-1
Conversion Price determined as hereinafter provided, in effect at the time of the conversion, or (ii) in
cash, as determined in good faith by the Board. No dividends shall be declared or paid, and no
distribution shall be made, on any shares of Series A-1 Preferred, Series B-1 Preferred, or Common
Stock unless all dividends declared or accrued but unpaid on the Series C-! Preferred have been paid
or set apart for payment. After the payment or setting aside for payment of the dividends described
in Section 1(a) and Section 1(b) any additional dividends (payable other than in shares of Common
Stock) declared or paid in any year shall be declared or paid among the holders of Series D
Preferred, Series C-1 Preferred, and Common Stock then outstanding based on the number of shares
of Common Stock held by each such holder (assuming full conversion of the Series D Preferred and
Series C-] Preferred.) Any amounts for which assets are not legally available shall be paid promptly
as assets become legally available therefor.

{c) Subject to the preferential rights of the Series D Preferred and the Series C-1
Preferred, the holders of outstanding Series A-1 Preferred and Series B-1 Preferred shall be entitled
to receive dividends, out of any assets legally available therefor, prior and in preference to any
declaration or payment of any dividend (payable other than in Common Stock or other securities and
rights convertible into or entitling the holder thereof to receive, directly or indirectly, additional
shares of Common Stock of the Corporation) on the Common Stock at the rate of $0.15 per share of

right to dividends on shares of Series A-1 Preferred and Series B-1 Preferred shall not be
cumulative, and no right shall accrue to holders of any shares because dividends on such shares are

interest. Any amounts for which assets are not legally available shall be paid promptly as assets
become legally available therefor.

and without the separate affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Common Stock entitled
to vote, irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL.

4. Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock have conversion rights as follows
(the “Conversion Rights’):

-7-
the Corporation or any transfer agent for the Series A-1 Preferred, into such number of fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing $2.0454 by the Series A-1
Conversion Price, determined as hereinafter provided, in effect at the time of the conversion. As of

Common Stock shall be deliverable upon conversion of shares of the Series A-1 Preferred (the

per share of Common Stock. Such initial Series B-1 Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment
as hereinafter provided. Each share of Series C-1 Preferred shall be convertible, at the option of the
holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share at the office of the Corporation or
any transfer agent for the Series C-] Preferred, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable
shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Series C-1 Original Issue Price by the
Series C-1 Conversion Price, determined as hereinafter provided, in effect at the time of the
conversion. As of the date this Restated Certificate is filed with the Secretary of State, the price at
which shares of Common Stock shall be deliverable upon conversion of shares of the Series C-1
Preferred (the ‘Series C-1 Conversion Price’) shall initially be $0.515 per share of Common Stock.
Such initial Series C-1 Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment as hereinafter provided. Each
share of Series D Preferred shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after
the date of issuance of such share at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for the

Series D Preferred, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is
determined by dividing the Series D Original Issue Price by the Series D Conversion Price,
determined as hereinafter provided, in effect at the time of the conversion. The price at which shares
of Common Stock shall be deliverable upon conversion of shares of the Series D Preferred (the
“Series D Conversion Price”) shall initially be $0.515 per share of Common Stock. Such initial

Upon conversion, all declared or accrued and unpaid dividends on the Preferred Stock shall
be paid cither in cash or in shares of Common Stock of the Corporation, at the election of the
Corporation, wherein the shares of Common Stock shall be valued at the fair market value at the
time of such conversion, as determined in good faith by the Board.

(b) Automatic Conversion.

(i) | Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into
shares of Common Stock at the then effective Series A-1 Conversion Price, Series B-1 Conversion
Price, Series C-1 Conversion Price and Series D Conversion Price, as applicable immediately prior
to the closing of a firm underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement

-8-
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (other than a registration relating solely (A) to a
transaction under Rule 145 under such Act (or any successor thereto) or (B) to an employee benefit
plan of the Corporation), covering the offer and sale of shares of the Corporation’s Common Stock
which generates gross proceeds of not less than $25,000,000 (before deduction of underwriter
commissions and offering expenses) and in which the Corporation has a pre-money valuation (equal
to the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (assuming the conversion of aJl outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock into Common Stock and the exercise of all granted and outstanding options
whether vested or not) at the effective time of an offering multiplied by the initial price to the public
in such offering) of at least $100,000,000 (a “Qualified IPO”). In the event of the automatic
conversion of the Preferred Stock upon a public offering as aforesaid, the person(s) entitled to
receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to
have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities.

(ii) Prior to a Qualified IPO, each share of Preferred Stock shall
automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the then effective Series A-1 Conversion
Price, Series B-] Conversion Price, Series C-1 Conversion Price and Series D Conversion Price, as
applicable upon the date specified by vote or written consent or agreement of the holders of at least
seventy percent (70%) of the Series D Preferred then outstanding, voting or acting as a single and
separate class (each of (i) and (ii) being an “Event of Conversion’).

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be
issued upon conversion of Series A-1 Preferred, Series B-1 Preferred, Series C-1 Preferred, or Series
D Preferred. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would otherwise be entitled (after
aggregating all shares of Series A-1 Preferred, Series B-1 Preferred, Series C-1 Preferred, or Series
D Preferred held by such holder such that the maximum number of whole shares of Common Stock
is issued to such holder upon conversion), the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction
multiplied by the then effective Series A-1 Conversion Price, Series B-1 Conversion Price, Series C-
1 Conversion Price, or Series D Conversion Price, respectively. Before any holder of Series A-1
Preferred, Series B-1 Preferred, Series C-1 Preferred, or Series D Preferred shall be entitled to
convert the same into full shares of Common Stock and to receive certificates therefor, he shall
surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of
any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the Corporation at such
office that he elects to convert the same; provided, however, that in the event of an automatic
conversion pursuant to paragraph (b) hereof, the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be
converted automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not
the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent; and
provided, further, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such automatic conversion unless the certificates evidencing
such shares of Series A-1 Preferred, Series B-1 Preferred, Series C-1 Preferred, or Series D
Preferred, as applicable, are either delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent as provided
above, or the holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost,
stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the
Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates.

The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after such delivery, or after such agreement and
indemnification, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Series A-1 Preferred, Series B-1

-9-
Preferred, Series C-1 Preferred, or Series D Preferred, as applicable, a certificate or certificates for
the number of shares of Common Stock to which he shall be entitled as aforesaid and a check
payable to the holder in the amount of any cash amounts payable as the result of a conversion into
fractional shares of Common Stock. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made
immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Series A-1
Preferred, Series B-1 Preferred, Series C-1 Preferred, or Series D Preferred to be converted, or, in
the case of automatic conversion, on the date of closing of the offering or the date of written election
to convert, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon
such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of
Common Stock on such date.

Additional Shares of Common Stock shall mean the price per share obtained by dividing the total

account in any subsequent adjustment made to the Series A-1 Conversion Price, Series B-1
Conversion Price, Series C-! Conversion Price and/or Series D Conversion Price.

C. Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock.

(1) Options and Convertible Secunties. Except as
otherwise provided in Section 4(d)(i){B) of this Article IV, in the event the Corporation at any time

or from time to time after the Series D Original Issue Date shall issue any Options or Convertible
Securities or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled
to receive any such Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of shares (as set
forth in the instrument relating thereto without regard to any provisions contained therein for a
subsequent adjustment of such number) of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such
Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities and Options therefor, the conversion or exchange of
such Convertible Securities or Options for Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to be Additional
Shares of Common Stock issued as of the time of such issue of Options or Convertible Securities or,
in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date,
provided that Additional Shares of Common Stock shall not be deemed to have been issued unless
the consideration per share (determined pursuant to Section 4(d)(i)(E) hereof) of such Additional
Shares of Common Stock would be less than the Series D Conversion Price in effect on the date of
and immediately prior to such issue, or such record date; and provided, further, that in any such case
in which Additional Shares of Common Stock are deemed to be issued:

(a) no further adjustment in the Series A-1
Conversion Price, Series B-1 Conversion Price, Series C-1 Conversion Price, or Series D Conversion
Price shall be made upon the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities or shares of Common Stock
upon the exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities;

(b) upon the expiration of any such Options or any
rights of conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have been
exercised, the Series A-1 Conversion Price, Series B-! Conversion Price, Series C-1 Conversion
Price, or Series D Conversion Price, as applicable, computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon
the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon,
shall, upon such expiration, be recomputed as if:

(I) in the case of Convertible Securities or
Options for Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common Stock issued were the shares of
Common Stock, if any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities and the consideration received therefor was the
consideration actually received by the Corporation for the issue of all such Options, whether or not
exercised, plus the consideration actually received by the Corporation upon such exercise, or for the
issue of all such Convertible Securities which were actually converted or exchanged, plus the

-12-
additional consideration, if any, actually received by the Corporation upon such conversion or
exchange, and

(I) in the case of Options for Convertible
Securities, only the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were
issued at the time of issue of such Options, and the consideration received by the Corporation for the
Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been then issued was the consideration actually
received by the Corporation for the issue of all such Options, whether or not exercised, plus the
consideration deemed to have been received by the Corporation upon the issue of the Convertible
Securities with respect to which such Options were actually exercised;

(c) no readjustment pursuant to clause (b) above
shall have the effect of increasing the Series A-1 Conversion Price, the Series B-1 Conversion Price,
the Series C-1 Conversion Price, or the Series D Conversion Price to an amount which exceeds the
lower of (i) the Series A-1 Conversion Price, the Series B-1 Conversion Price, the Series C-1
Conversion Price, or the Series D Conversion Price, as applicable, immediately prior to the original
adjustment date, or (ii) the Series A-1 Conversion Price, the Series B-1 Conversion Price, the Series
C-1 Conversion Price, or the Series D Conversion Price that would have resulted from any issuance
of Additional Shares of Common Stock between the original adjustment date and such readjustment
date; and

(d) in the case of Options which expire by their
terms not more than thirty (30) days after the date of issue thereof, no adjustment of the Series A-|
Conversion Price, the Series B-1 Conversion Price, the Series C-1 Conversion Price, or the Series D
Conversion Price, as applicable, shall be made until the expiration or exercise of all such Options.

D. Adjustment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional
Shares of Common Stock. In the event the Corporation shall after the Series D Original Issue Date

issue Additional Shares of Common Stock (including Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed
to be issued pursuant to Section 4(d)(i)(C) of this Article [V) without consideration or for a
consideration per share less than the Series D Conversion Price in effect on the date of and
immediately prior to such issue, then and in such event, each of the Series A-1 Conversion Price, the
Series B-1 Conversion Price, the Series C-1 Conversion Price, and the Series D Conversion Price
shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest cent) determined
by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of shares of
Common Stock which the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for the total number
of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued would purchase at such Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such issuance, and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of such Additional
Shares of Common Stock so issued. For the purpose of the above calculation, the number of shares
of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue shall be calculated as if all shares of
Preferred Stock and all Convertible Securities had been fully converted into shares of Common
Stock immediately prior to such issuance and any outstanding warrants, options or other rights for
the purchase of shares of stock or convertible securities had been fully exercised immediately prior
to such issuance (and the resulting securities fully converted into shares of Common Stock, if so

-13-
convertible). For the purposes of this Section 4, the grant, issue or sale of Additional Shares of
Common Stock consisting of the same class of security and warrants to purchase such security
issued or issuable at the same price at two or more closings held within a six-month period shall be
aggregated and shall be treated as one sale of Additional Shares of Common Stock occurring on the
earliest date on which such securities were granted, issued or sold.

E. Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this
Section 4(d), the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional Shares of
Common Stock shall be computed as follows:

(1) Cash and Property: Such consideration shall:

(a) _ insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
aggregate amount of cash received by the Corporation excluding amounts paid or payable for
accrued interest or accrued dividends;

(b) insofar as it consists of services or property
other than cash, be computed at the fair value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in
good faith by the Board; and

(c) inthe event Additional Shares of Common
Stock are issued together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for
consideration which covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as
provided in clauses (a) and (b) above, allocated to such Additional Shares of Common Stock as
determined in good faith by the Board.

(2) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration

per share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been
issued pursuant to Section 4(d)(i)(C), relating to Options and Convertible Securities, shall be
determined by dividing

(a) the total amount, if any, received or receivable
by the Corporation as consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the
minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating
thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such
consideration) payable to the Corporation upon the exercise in full of such Options or the conversion
or exchange in full of such Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible
Securities, the exercise in full of such Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or
exchange in full of such Convertible Securities, by

(b) the maximum number of shares of Common
Stock (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained
therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise in full of such
Options or the conversion or exchange in full of such Convertible Securities, or in the case of
Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise in full of such Options for Convertible Securities
and the conversion or exchange in full of such Convertible Securities.

-14-
(ii) | Adjustments for Subdivisions, Combinations or Consolidations of
Common Stock. In the event after the date of the filing of this Restated Certificate with the

Secretary of State the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided (by stock split, stock
dividend or otherwise), into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Series A-1
Conversion Price, Series B-1 Conversion Price, the Series C-1 Conversion Price, and Series D
Conversion Price then in effect shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such subdivision, be
proportionately decreased. In the event after the date of the filing of this Restated Certificate with
the Secretary of State the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined or consolidated,
by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, the Series A-]}
Conversion Price, Series B-1 Conversion Price, the Series C-1 Conversion Price, and Series D
Conversion Price then in effect shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination or
consolidation, be proportionately increased.

(iii) | Adjustments for Other Distributions. In the event the Corporation at
any time or from time to time makes, or fixes a record date for the determination of holders of
Common Stock entitled to receive, any distribution payable in securities of the Corporation other
than shares of Common Stock and other than as otherwise adjusted in this Section 4, then and in
each such event provision shall be made so that the holders of Preferred Stock shall receive upon
conversion thereof, in addition to the number of shares of Common Stock receivable thereupon, the
amount of securities of the Corporation which they would have received had their shares of
Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event and had they
thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to and including the date of conversion,
retained such securities receivable by them as aforesaid during such period, subject to all other
adjustments called for during such period under this Section 4 with respect to the rights of the
holders of the Preferred Stock.

(iv) Adjustments for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. Ifthe
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or a

different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization,
reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision, combination or consolidation of shares
provided for above), the Series A-1 Conversion Price, the Series B-] Conversion Price, the Series C-
1 Conversion Price, and the Series D Conversion Price, as applicable, then in effect shall,
concurrently with the effectiveness of such reorganization or reclassification, be proportionately
adjusted such that the Preferred Stock, as applicable, shall be convertible into, in lieu of the number
of shares of Common Stock which the holders would otherwise have been entitled to receive, a
number of shares of such other class or classes of stock equivalent to the number of shares of
Common Stock that would have been subject to receipt by the holders upon conversion of such
shares of Preferred Stock immediately before that change.

(e) No Impairment. The Corporation will not, through any reorganization,
transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary
action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or
performed hereunder by the Corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out
of all the provisions of this Section 4 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or
appropriate in order to protect the Conversion Rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock against

-15-
impairment. This provision shall not restrict the Corporation’s rights to amend this Restated
Certificate with the requisite stockholder consent or approval.

(f) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Series A-1 Conversion Price, the Series B-1 Conversion Price, the Series C-1
Conversion Price, and the Series D Conversion Price, pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation at
its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms
hereof and furnish to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or
readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based.
The Corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock, furnish
or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and
readjustments, (ii) the Series A-1 Conversion Price, the Series B-1 Conversion Price, the Series C-1]
Conversion Price, and the Series D Conversion Price at the time in effect, and (iii) the number of
shares of Common Stock and the amount, ifany, of other property which at the time would be
received upon the conversion of such holder's shares of Preferred Stock.

5. Redemption.

(a) Redemption at Option of Holders of a Majority of Series D Preferred. At any
time after the fifth anniversary of the Series D Original Issue Date, the holders of at least a majority

of the then outstanding Series D Preferred, voting as a single class, may request that all or, if less
than all, a specified percentage of such holders’ respective shares of Series D Preferred be redeemed
by the Corporation. Within forty-five (45) days after the receipt by the Corporation of a written
request for such redemption from such holders, and concurrently with surrender by such holders of
the certificates representing such shares, the Corporation shall, to the extent it may lawfully do so,
redeem in three (3) annual installments (each payment date being referred to herein as a “Series D
Redemption Date”) the shares specified in such request by paying in cash therefor an amount per
share equal to the Series D Original Issue Price plus an additional amount equal to any dividends
declared or accrued but unpaid on each such share (the “Series D Redemption Price’). The number
of shares of Series D Preferred that this Corporation shall be required to redeem on each Series D
Redemption Date shall be equal to the amount determined by dividing (i) the aggregate number of
shares of Series D Preferred outstanding immediately prior to any such Series D Redemption Date
that have been requested to be redeemed pursuant to this subsection (a) by (ii) the number of
remaining Series D Redemption Dates (including the Series D Redemption Date to which such
calculation applies). Any redemption effected pursuant to this Section 5(a) shall be made on a pro
rata basis among the holders of Series D Preferred to be redeemed in proportion to the number of
shares of Series D Preferred then held by such holders.

(b) Redemption at Option of Holders of a Majority of Series C-1 Preferred. At any
time after the fifth anniversary of the Series D Original Issue Date, the holders of at least a majority

of the then outstanding Series C-1 Preferred, voting as a single class, may request that all or, if less
than all, a specified percentage of such holders’ respective shares of Series C-1 Preferred be
redeemed by the Corporation; provided, however that no shares of Series C-1 Preferred may be
redeemed on any Series C-1 Redemption Date pursuant to this Section 5(b) unless and until all
shares of Series D Preferred required to be redeemed on such date pursuant to Section 5(a) above, if
any, have been so redeemed. Within forty-five (45) days after the receipt by the Corporation of a

-16-
written request for such redemption from such holders, and concurrently with surrender by such
holders of the certificates representing such shares, the Corporation shall, to the extent it may
lawfully do so, redeem in three (3) annual installments (each payment date being referred to herein
as a ‘Series C-1 Redemption Date’) the shares specified in such request by paying in cash therefor
an amount per share equal to the Series C-1 Original Issue Price plus an additional amount equal to
any dividends declared or accrued but unpaid on each such share (the “Series C-1 Redemption
Price”). The number of shares of Series C-1 Preferred that this Corporation shall be required to
redeem on each Series C-1 Redemption Date shall be equal to the amount determined by dividing
(i) the aggregate number of shares of Series C-1 Preferred outstanding immediately prior to any such
Series C-] Redemption Date that have been requested to be redeemed pursuant to this subsection (a)
by (ii) the number of remaining Series C-1 Redemption Dates (including the Redemption Date to
which such calculation applies). Any redemption effected pursuant to this Section 5(b) shall be
made on a pro rata basis among the holders of Series C-1 Preferred to be redeemed in proportion to
the number of shares of Series C-1 Preferred then held by such holders. The Series D Redemption
Date and the Series C-1 Redemption Date are each referred to herein as a “Redemption Date”. The
Series D Redemption Price and the Series C-]1 Redemption Price are each referred to herein as a
“Redemption Price”.

(c) Redemption Procedure. At least twenty (20) days pnor to each Redemption Date,
written notice (the “Redemption Notice”) shall be mailed, postage prepaid, to each holder of record
(at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given) of the

Series D Preferred or Series C-1 Preferred to be redeemed, at the address last shown on the records
of the Corporation for such holder or given by the holder to the Corporation for the purpose of notice
or if no such address appears or is given, at the place where the principal executive office of the
Corporation is located, notifying such holder of the redemption to be effected, specifying the number
of shares to be redeemed from such holder, the applicable Redemption Price, the place at which
payment may be obtained and calling upon such holder to surrender to the Corporation, in the
manner and at the place designated, its certificate or certificates representing the shares to be
redeemed. Except as provided in subsection (d) below, on or after each Redemption Date, each
holder of Series D Preferred or Series C-1 Preferred to be redeemed shall surrender to the
Corporation the certificate or certificates representing such shares, in the manner and at the place
designated in the Redemption Notice, and thereupon the aggregate Redemption Price of such shares
shall be payable to the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as
the owner thereof and each surrendered certificate shall be cancelled. In the event less than all the
shares represented by any such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued
representing the unredeemed shares.

(d) Effect of Redemption. From and after each Redemption Date, unless there shall
have been a default in payment of the Redemption Price, all rights of the holders of the shares of
Series D Preferred or Series C-1 Preferred, as applicable, to be redeemed on a Redemption Date
(except the right to receive their respective Redemption Price without interest upon surrender of their
certificate or certificates) shall cease with respect to such shares, and such shares shall not thereafter
be transferred on the books of the Corporation or be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose
whatsoever. If the funds of the Corporation legally available for redemption on any Redemption
Date are insufficient to redeem the total number of shares requested to be redeemed on such date,
those funds which are legally available will be used to redeem the maximum possible number of

-17-
such shares ratably among the holders of such shares to be redeemed based upon their holdings of
Series D Preferred or Series C-1 Preferred, as the case may be. The shares not redeemed shall
remain outstanding and be entitled to all the rights and preferences provided herein. At any time
thereafter when additional funds of the Corporation are legally available for the redemption of shares
not redeemed, such funds will immediately be set aside for the redemption of the balance of the
shares which the Corporation has become obligated to redeem on any Redemption Date but which it
has not redeemed.

(e) Redemption Funding. On or prior to each Redemption Date, the Corporation
shall deposit the applicable Redemption Price of all shares of Series D Preferred or Series C-1
Preferred designated for redemption in the Redemption Notice, and not yet redeemed or converted,
with a bank or trust company having aggregate capital and surplus in excess of $100,000,000 as a
trust fund for the benefit of the respective holders of the shares designated for redemption and not
yet redeemed. Simultaneously, the Corporation shall deposit irrevocable instructions and authority
to such bank or trust company to pay, on and after the date fixed for redemption or prior thereto, the
applicable Redemption Price to the holders of Series D Preferred and/or Series C-1 Preferred, as the
case may be, upon receipt of notification from the Corporation that such holder has surrendered such
holder’s certificates pursuant to subsection (c) above. Any moncy deposited by the Corporation
pursuant to this subsection (e) for the redemption of shares which are thereafter converted into
shares of Common Stock no later than the close of business on the last business day prior to the
Redemption Date shall be returned to the Corporation forthwith upon such conversion. The balance
of any money deposited by the Corporation pursuant to this subsection (e) remaining unclaimed at
the expiration of six months following the Redemption Date shall thereafter be returned to the
Corporation, provided that the stockholder to which such money would be payable hereunder shall
be entitled, upon proof of its ownership of the Series D Preferred or Series C-1 Preferred and
payment of any bond requested by the Corporation, to receive such monies but without interest from
the Redemption Date.

6. Protective Provisions.

acquiring entity;

(vi) | redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire (or pay into or set aside for a
sinking fund for such purpose) any shares of Common Stock; provided, however, that this restriction

Incorporation, changing the powers, preferences or special rights of the shares of any other series or

-19-
by way of merger, consolidation or otherwise) that would alter or change adversely the powers,
preferences or special rights of the Series D Preferred; provided, however, that the Corporation’s

special rights of the Series D Preferred; provided, further, that any such authorization that includes
any provision for conversion of shares of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock in the event

change adversely the powers, preferences or special rights of the Series D Preferred.

(ii) issue securities in connection with a merger, acquisition or other
similar transaction that would represent, prior to such issuance, more than 30% of the outstanding

the Secretary of State) remain outstanding, the Corporation shall not, without obtaining the prior
affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of seventy percent (70%) of the Series C-1
Preferred, voting together as a single and separate class, take any action (including amending the
Corporation’s Certificate of Incorporation changing the powers, preferences or special rights of the
shares of any other series or by way of merger, consolidation or otherwise) that would alter or
change adversely the powers, preferences or special rights of the Series C-1 Preferred; provided,
however, that the Corporation’s authorization of additional shares of an existing class or series of
equity securities, the issuance of additional shares thereof, or the authorization or issuance of any
class or series of equity securities having any preference or priority as to voting, dividends or
distribution of assets upon liquidation, merger or otherwise, which is superior to or on parity with
