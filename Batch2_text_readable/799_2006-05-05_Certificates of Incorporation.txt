Section 4. Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have the following
conversion rights and obligations (the “Conversion Rights”’):

(a) Right to Convert Preferred Stock. Subject to Section 4(c) hereof, each
share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible at the option of the holder thereof at any time after
the date of issuance of such share at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for the
Preferred Stock, into one share of Common Stock subject to adjustment as hereinafter provided.
The conversion ratio (initially one-for-one) and conversion price which shall initially be $.70 per
share for the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock and $1.98 per share for
the Series C Preferred Stock (in each case the “applicable conversion price”) are subject to
adjustment as set forth below. Any adjustment in the applicable conversion ratio is determined
by dividing the initial applicable conversion price by the adjusted applicable conversion price.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock and Series
B Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock as provided in
this Section 4 upon the earlier of (i) the closing of a firm commitment underwritten public pee

7
offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the “Securities Act’), covering the offer and sale of Common Stock to the public with
net cash aggregate offering proceeds to the Corporation of not less than $15,000,000 (a
“Qualified Public Offering”) or (ii) the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 2/3rds of the
issued and outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock, voting separately as one class or (ili)
when, as a result of a partial liquidation of the Corporation, all shares of Series A Preferred Stock
and Series B Preferred Stock receive from the liquidation the full amount of their respective
liquidation preferences provided for in Section 2(a)(i1) and (111) above. In addition, the Series A
Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock upon the
conversion of all of the Series B Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock. Each share of
Series C Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock as
provided in this Section 4 upon the earlier of (i) the closing of a Qualified Public Offering or (ii)
the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 67% of the issued and outstanding shares of Series
C Preferred Stock, voting separately as one class

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. At the option of the Corporation, no fractional
shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of the Preferred Stock. In lieu of any
fractional shares to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation may pay to
such holder cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the then applicable conversion price with
respect to such fractional share. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert
the same into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates
therefor, duly endorsed, (or a lost stock affidavit evidencing such certificate(s) signed by the
holder with a reasonable indemnity in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation in case
of lost or destroyed stock certificates) at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for
the Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the Corporation at such office that the holder
elects to convert the same. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and
deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock (i) a certificate or certificates for the
number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid, (ii) a
check payable to such holder in the amount of any cash amounts payable as a result of the
conversion of any shares of Preferred Stock into fractional shares of Common Stock, and (iii) if
less than all of the shares of the Preferred Stock represented by such certificate are converted into
Common Stock, a certificate representing the shares of Preferred Stock not converted into
Common Stock. In the event of any conversion at the election of a holder of Preferred Stock,
such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business
on the date of such surrender of the shares (or a lost stock affidavit evidencing such certificate(s)
signed by the holder with a reasonable indemnity in a form reasonably satisfactory to the
Corporation in case of lost or destroyed stock certificates) of Preferred Stock to be converted,
and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such
conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of
Common Stock subsequent to such date.

(d) Adjustment of Applicable Conversion Price. The applicable conversion

price with respect to each series of Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment as follows:

(1) Adjustments for Subdivisions, Combinations or Consolidations of

Common Stock. In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided or
increased (by stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or otherwise) into a greater number of

8

ht
shares of Common Stock, and no equivalent subdivision or increase is made with respect to the
Preferred Stock, the respective applicable conversion price then in effect for each series of
Preferred Stock shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such subdivision or increase, be
proportionately decreased and the number of Common Shares into which such Preferred Stock
can be converted proportionately increased. In the event the outstanding shares of Common
Stock shall be combined or consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of
shares of Common Stock, the respective applicable conversion price then in effect for each series
of Preferred Stock shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination or
consolidation, be proportionately increased and the number of Common Shares into which such
Preferred Stock can be converted proportionately decreased.

(ii) Adjustments for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. In
the event the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be changed

into the same or a different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock, whether by
capital reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or otherwise (other
than a subdivision or combination of shares provided for above), and no equivalent capital
reorganization, reclassification or other change is made with respect to the Preferred Stock, the
applicable conversion price then in effect for each series of Preferred Stock shall, concurrently
with the effectiveness of such reorganization or reclassification, be proportionately adjusted such
that the Preferred Stock shall be convertible into, in lieu of the number of shares of Common
Stock which the holders thereof would otherwise have been entitled to receive, a number of
shares of such other class or classes of stock equivalent to the number of shares of Common
Stock that would have been subject to receipt by the holders thereof upon conversion of the
Preferred Stock immediately before such change.

(iii) Adjustments to Applicable Conversion Price for Certain Dilutive
Issues. Except as provided in subparagraph (iii)D below, if and whenever following the

Effective Time the Corporation shall issue or sell, or is, in accordance with subparagraph
Gii)C(1), through (iii)C(7) below, deemed to have issued or sold, id, any shares of Common Stock
for a consideration per share less than the respective conversion pi price-in effect immediately prior
to the time of such issue or sale, then, forthwith upon such issué or sale, the conversion price for
the Series C Preferred Stock shall be reduced as set forth in (ii1)A and B below and the
conversion price for the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock shall be
reduced to a price determined by multiplying the conversion price of the Series A Preferred
Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to the time of such issue or
sale by a fraction (x) the numerator of which shall be (a) the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding prior to such issue or sale, plus (b) the number of shares of Common Stock that the
aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for the total number of shares of Common
Stock so issued or sold would purchase at such conversion price, and (y) the denominator of
which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such
issue or sale plus the number of shares of Common Stock so issued or sold. For purposes of this
subsection (iii) including A and B below, Common Stock outstanding shall be calculated on a
fully diluted basis, treating all Preferred Stock as converted to Common, all warrants and options
as exercised, but excluding Common shares allocated to the Equity Incentive Plan but not the
subject of granted options
A Pre-May 5, 2008. If the issue or sale (including any deemed
issue or sale) occurs on or before May 5, 2008, the conversion price of the Series C Preferred
Stock shall be the price at which such issue or sale occurs;

B Post-May 5, 2008. If the issue or sale (including any deemed
issue or sale) occurs after May 5, 2008, the conversion price of the Series C Preferred Stock shall
be the price determined by multiplying the conversion price of the Series C Preferred Stock in
effect immediately prior to the time of such issue or sale by a fraction (x) the numerator of which
shall be (a) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding prior to such issue or sale, plus
(b) the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received by the
Corporation for the total number of shares of Common Stock so issued or sold would purchase at
such conversion price, and (y) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale plus the number of shares of
Common Stock so issued or sold.

C Other Provisions. For purposes of this subparagraph (iii), the
following subparagraphs C(1) to C(7) and subparagraphs D and E below shall also be applicable:

C(1) Issuance of Rights or Options. In case at any time the

Corporation shall in any manner grant (whether directly or by assumption in a merger or
otherwise) any warrants or other rights to subscribe for or to purchase, or any options for the
purchase of, Common Stock or any stock or security convertible into or exchangeable for Common
Stock (such warrants, rights or options being called "Options" and such convertible or
exchangeable stock or securities being called "Convertible Securities") whether or not such
Options or the right to convert or exchange any such Convertible Securities are immediately
exercisable, and the price per share for which Common Stock is issuable upon the exercise of such
Options or upon the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities (determined by
dividing (i) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Company as consideration for
the granting of such Options, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration
payable to the Company upon the exercise of all such Options, plus, in the case of such Options
which relate to Convertible Securities, the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration,
if any, payable upon the issue or sale of such Convertible Securities and upon the conversion or
exchange thereof, by (ii) the total maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the
exercise of such Options or upon the conversion or exchange of all such Convertible Securities
issuable upon the exercise of such Options) shall be less than the conversion price in effect
immediately prior to the time of the granting of such Options, then the total maximum number of
shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Options or upon conversion or
exchange of the total maximum amount of such Convertible Securities issuable upon the exercise
of such Options shall be deemed to have been issued for such price per share as of the date of
granting of such Options or the issuances of such Convertible Securities and thereafter shall be
deemed to be outstanding. Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph C(3), no adjustment of
the conversion price shal] be made upon the actual issue of such Common Stock or of such
Convertible Securities upon exercise of such Options or upon the actual issue of such Common
Stock upon conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities.
C(2) Issuance of Convertible Securities. In case the Corporation
shal] in any manner issue (whether directly or by assumption in a merger or otherwise) or sell any
Convertible Securities, whether or not the rights to exchange or convert any such Convertible
Securities are immediately exercisable, and the price per share for which Common Stock is
issuable upon such conversion or exchange (determined by dividing (i) the total amount received
or receivable by the Company as consideration for the issue or sale of such Convertible Securities,
plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to the Company
upon the conversion or exchange thereof, by (ii) the total maximum number of shares of Common
Stock issuable upon the conversion or exchange of all such Convertible Securities) shall be less
than the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the time of such issue or sale, then the
total maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exchange of all
such Convertible Securities shall be deemed to have been issued for such price per share as of the
date of the issue or sale of such Convertible Securities and thereafter shall be deemed to be
outstanding, provided that (a) except as otherwise provided in subparagraph C(3), no adjustment of
the Conversion Price shall be made upon the actual issue of such Common Stock upon conversion
or exchange of such Convertible Securities and (b) if any such issue or sale of such Convertible
Securities is made upon exercise of any Options to purchase any such Convertible Securities for
which adjustments of the Conversion Price have been or are to be made pursuant to other
provisions of this subparagraph C, no further adjustment of the conversion price shall be made by
reason of such issue or sale.

C(3) Change in Option Price or Conversion Rate. Upon the

happening of any of the following events, namely, if the purchase price provided for in any Option
referred to in subparagraph C(\), the additional consideration, if any, payable upon the conversion
or exchange of any Convertible Securities referred to in subparagraph C(1) or C(2), or the rate at
which Convertible Securities referred to in subparagraph C(1) or C(2) are convertible into or
exchangeable for Common Stock shall change at any time (including, but not limited to, changes
under or by reason of provisions designed to protect against dilution), the conversion price in
effect at the time of such event shall forthwith be readjusted to the conversion price which would
have been in effect at such time had such Options or Convertible Securities still outstanding
provided for such changed purchase price, additional consideration or conversion rate, as the case
may be, at the time initially granted, issued or sold, but only if as a result of such adjustment the
conversion price then in effect hereunder is thereby reduced; and on the expiration of any such
Option or the termination of any such right to convert or exchange such Convertible Securities, the
conversion price then in effect hereunder shall forthwith be increased to the conversion price
which would have been in effect at the time of such expiration or termination had such Option or
Convertible Securities, to the extent outstanding immediately prior to such expiration or
termination, never been issued.

C(4) Stock Dividends. In case the Corporation shall declare a
dividend or make any other distribution upon any stock of the Corporation payable in Common
Stock , Options or Convertible Securities, any Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities,
as the case may be, issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution shall be deemed to have
been issued or sold without consideration.

C(5) Consideration for Stock. In case any shares of Common
Stock, Options or Convertible Securities shall be issued or sold for cash, the consideration received

11

ar
therefor shall be deemed to be the amount received by the Corporation therefor, without deduction
therefrom of any expenses incurred or any underwriting commissions or concessions paid or
allowed by the Corporation in connection therewith. In case any shares of Common Stock,
Options or Convertible Securities shall be issued or sold for a consideration other than cash, the
amount of the consideration other than cash received by the Corporation shall be deemed to be the
fair value of such consideration as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation, without deduction of any expenses incurred or any underwriting commissions or
concessions paid or allowed by the Corporation in connection therewith. In case any Options shall
be issued in connection with the issue and sale of other securities of the Corporation, together
comprising one integral transaction in which no specific consideration is allocated to such Options
by the parties thereto, such Options shall be deemed to have been issued for such consideration as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

C(6) Record Date. In case the Corporation shall take a record of
the holders of its Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them (i) to receive a dividend or other
distribution payable in Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities or (ii) to subscribe for or
purchase Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities, then such record date shall be deemed
to be the date of the issue or sale of the shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued or
sold upon the declaration of such dividend or the making of such other distribution or the date of
the granting of such right of subscription or purchase, as the case may be.

C(7) Treasury Shares. The disposition of any shares of Common
Stock owned or held by or for the account of the Corporation shal! be considered an issue or sale
of Common Stock for the purpose or this subparagraph C.

upon any dividend or distribution on any shares of Preferred Stock or on any shares of Common

Preferred fails to participate with other holders of Series B Preferred based on their relative

ye

of Series B Preferred held by such holder will not be entitled to any anti-dilution adjustment in
connection with such financing and shall automatically convert into a new series of Preferred
Stock, which shares will be identical to the Series B Preferred Stock except that (i) the shares will

at the time outstanding having prior rights as to dividends, the holders of the Common Stock
shall be entitled to receive, when and as declared by the Board, out of any assets of the
Corporation legally available therefor, such dividends as may be declared from time to time by

the Bylaws of the Corporation.

ARTICLE VIII

The Corporation eliminates the personal liability of each member of its Board of
Directors to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary
duty as a director, provided, however, that, to the extent provided by applicable law the
foregoing shall not eliminate the liability of a director (i) for any breach of such director’s duty
of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or
which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of
Title 8 of the Delaware Code or (iv) for any transaction from which such director derived an
improper personal benefit. No amendment to or repeal of this provision shall apply to or have

15
any effect on the liability or alleged liability of any director for or with respect to any acts or
omissions of such director occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.

Section 1. Actions, Suits and Proceedings Other than by or in the Right of the
Corporation. The Corporation shall indemnify each person who was or is a party or is

threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the nght of
the Corporation), by reason of the fact that he is or was, or has agreed to become, a director or
officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving, or has agreed to serve, at the request of the
Corporation, as a director, officer, agent or trustee of, or in a similar capacity with, another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit
plan) (each such person being referred to hereafter as an “Indemnitee”), or by reason of any
action alleged to have been taken or omitted in such capacity, against all expenses (including
attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably
incurred by him or on his behalf in connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any
appeal therefrom, if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in, or
not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any
action suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo
contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act
in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, best
interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had
reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Article, except as set forth in Section 7 below, the Corporation shall not
indemnify an Indemnitee secking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part
thereof) initiated by the Indemnitee unless the initiation thereof was approved by the Board of
Directors of the Corporation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article, the
Corporation shall not indemnify an Indemnitee to the extent such Indemnitee is reimbursed from
the proceeds of insurance, and in the event the Corporation makes any indemnification payments
to an Indemnitee and such Indemnitee is subsequently reimbursed from the proceeds of
insurance, such Indemnitee shall promptly refund such indemnification payments to the
Corporation to the extent of such insurance reimbursement.

Section 2. Actions or Suits by or in the Right of the Corporation. The
Corporation shall indemnify any Indemnitee who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a

party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation
to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was, or has agreed to
become, a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving, or has agreed to serve, at
the request of the Corporation, as a director, officer, agent or trustee of, or in a similar capacity
with, another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any
employee benefit plan), or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in such
capacity, against all expenses (including attorneys’ fees) and, to the extent permitted by law, er
amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in
connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if he acted in good
faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to, the best interests of the
Corporation, except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or
matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless

16
and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of Delaware or the court in which such action
or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of such
liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably
entitled to indemnity for such expenses (including attorneys fees) which the Court of Chancery
of Delaware or such other court shall deem proper. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Article, the Corporation shall not indemnify an Indemnitee to the extent such Indemnitee is
reimbursed from the proceeds of insurance, and in the event the Corporation makes any
indemnification payments to an Indemnitee and such Indemnitec is subsequently reimbursed
from the proceeds of insurance, such Indemnitee shall promptly refund such indemnification
payments to the Corporation to the extent of such insurance reimbursement.

Section 3. Indemnification for Expenses of Successful Party. Notwithstanding the

other provisions of this Article, to the extent that an Indemnitee has been successful, on the
merits or otherwise, in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Sections 1 and 2 of
this Article, or in defense of any claim issue or matter therein or on appeal from any such action,
suit or proceeding he shall be indemnified against all expenses (including attorneys’ fees)
actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection therewith. Without
limiting the foregoing, if any action, suit or proceeding is disposed of, on the merits or otherwise
(including a disposition without prejudice), without (1) the disposition being adverse to the
Indemnitee, (ii) an adjudication that the Indemnitee was liable to the Corporation, (iii) a plea of
guilty or nolo contendere by the Indemnitee, (iv) an adjudication that the Indemnitee did not act
in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests
of the Corporation, and (v) with respect to any criminal proceeding, an adjudication that the
Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful, the Indemnitee shall be
considered for the purposes hereof to have been wholly successful with respect thereto.

Section 4. Notification and Defense of Claim. As a condition precedent to his right
to be indemnified, the Indemnitee must notify the Corporation in writing as soon as practicable
of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation involving him for which indemnity will or could
be sought. With respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation of which the Corporation
is so notified, the Corporation will be entitled to participate therein at its own expense and/or to
assume the defense thereof at its own expense, with legal counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnitee. After notice from the Corporation to the Indemnitee of its election so to assume
such defense, the Corporation shall not be liable to the Indemnitee for any legal or other
expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such a claim, other than as
provided below in this Section 4. The Indemnitee shall! have the right to employ his own counsel
in connection with such claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred after notice to
the Corporation of its assumption of the defense thereof shall be at the expense of the Indemnitee
unless (i) the employment of counsel by the Indemnitee has been authorized by the Corporation,
(ii) counsel to the Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of
interest or position on any significant issue between the Corporation and the Indemnitee in the
conduct of the defense of such action or (ii1) the Corporation shall not in fact have employed
counsel to assume the defense of such action, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of
counsel for the Indemnitee shall be at the expense of the Corporation, except as otherwise
expressly provided by this Article. The Corporation shall not be entitled, without the consent of
the Indemnitee, to assume the defense of any claim brought by or in the right of the Corporation

17
or as to which counsel for the Indemnitee shall have reasonably made the conclusion provided
for in clause (i1) above.

Section 5. Advance of Expenses. Subject to the provisions of Section 6 below, in
the event that the Corporation does not assume the defense pursuant to Section 4 of this Article
of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation of which the Corporation receives notice under
this Article, any expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by an Indemnitee in defending a
civil or criminal action, suit, proceeding or investigation or any appeal therefrom shall be paid by
the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such matter; provided, however, that the
payment of such expenses incurred by an Indemnitee in advance of the final disposition of such
matter shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to
repay all amounts so advanced in the event that it shall ultimately be determined that the
Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article.
Such undertaking shall be accepted without reference to the financial ability of the Indemnitee to
make such repayment.

Section 6. Procedure for Indemnification. In order to obtain indemnification or
advancement of expenses pursuant to Section 1, 2, 3 or 5 of this Article, the Indemnitee shall
submit to the Corporation a written request, including in such request such documentation and
information as is reasonably available to the Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to
determine whether and to what extent the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification or
advancement of expenses. Any such indemnification or advancement of expenses shall be made
promptly, and in any event within 60 days after receipt by the Corporation of the written request
of the Indemnitee, unless with respect to requests under Section 1, 2 or S the Corporation
determines within such 60-day period that the Indemnitee did not meet the applicable standard of
conduct set forth in Section 1 or 2, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made in each
instance by (i) a majority of the directors of the Corporation consisting of persons who are not at
that time parties to the action, suit or proceeding in question (“disinterested directors”), whether
or not a quorum, (il) a vote of at least 60% of a quorum of the outstanding shares of stock of all
classes entitled to vote for directors, voting as a single class, which quorum shall consist of
stockholders who are not at that time parties to the action, suit or proceeding in question, (iii)
independent legal counsel (who may, to the extent permitted by law, be regular legal counsel to
the Corporation), or (iv) a court of competent jurisdiction.

Section 7. Remedies, The right to indemnification or advances as granted by this
Article shall be enforceable by the Indemnitee in any court of competent jurisdiction if the
Corporation denies such request, in whole or in part, or if no disruption thereof is made within
the 60-day period referred to above in Section 6. Unless otherwise required by law, the burden of
proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses under
this Article shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation to have made a
determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification is proper in the
circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual
determination by the Corporation pursuant to Section 6 that the Indemnitee has not met such
applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the
Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct. The Indemnitee’s expenses
(including attorneys’ fees) incurred in connection with successfully establishing his right to

18

hr”
indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such proceeding shall also be indemnified by the
Corporation.

Section 8. Subsequent Amendment. No amendment, termination or repeal of this
Article or of the relevant provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or
any other applicable laws shall affect or diminish in any way the rights of any Indemnitee to
indemnification under the provisions hereof with respect to any action, suit, proceeding or
investigation arising out of or relating to any actions, transactions or facts occurring prior to the
final adoption of such amendment, termination or repeal.

Section 9. Other Rights. The indemnification and advancement of expenses
provided by this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an
Indemnitee seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any law
(common or statutory), agreement or vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise,
both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in any other capacity while holding
office for the Corporation, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director
or officer, and shall inure to the benefit of the estate, heirs, executors and administrators of the
Indemnitee. Nothing contained in this Article shall be deemed to prohibit, and the Corporation is
specifically authorized to enter into, agreements with officers and directors providing
indemnification rights and procedures different from those set forth in this Article. In addition,
the Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by its Board of Directors, grant
indemnification nghts to other employees or agents of the Corporation or other persons serving
the Corporation and such rights may be equivalent to, or greater or less than, those set form in
this Article and as limited by applicable law.

Section 10. Partial Indemnification. If an Indemnitec is entitled under any provision
of this Article to Indemnification by the Corporation for some or a portion of the expenses
(including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement actually and
reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or
investigation and any appeal therefrom but not, however, for the total amount thereof, the
Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify the Indemnitee for the portion of such expenses
(including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement to which the
Indemnitee is entitled.

Section 11. Insurance. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance, at its
expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee
benefit plan) against any expense, liability or loss incurred by him in any such capacity, or
arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to
indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware.

Section 12. Merger or Consolidation. If the Corporation is merged into or
consolidated with another corporation and the Corporation is not the surviving corporation, the
surviving corporation shall assume the obligations of the Corporation under this Article with
respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or relating to any actions,
transactions or facts occurring prior to the date of such merger or consolidation.

19
Section 13. Savings Clause. If this Article or any portion hereof shall be invalidated
on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless
indemnify each Indemnitee as to any expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and
amounts paid in settlement in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal or administrative, including an action by or in the right of the
Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article that shal! not
have been invalidated and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

Section 14. Definitions. Terms used herein and defined in Section 145(h) and
Section 145(i) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware shall have the respective
meanings assigned to such terms in such Section 145(h) and Section 145(i).

Section 15. Subsequent Legislation. If the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware is amended after adoption of this Article to expand further the indemnification
permitted to Indemnitces, then the Corporation shall indemnify such persons to the fullest extent
permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as so amended.

ARTICLE IX

Meetings of the stockholders may be held within or without the State of Delaware, as the
Bylaws may provide. The books of the Corporation may be kept (subject to any provision
contained in the statutes) outside of the State of Delaware at such place or places as may be
designated from time to time by the Board or in the Bylaws of the Corporation.
