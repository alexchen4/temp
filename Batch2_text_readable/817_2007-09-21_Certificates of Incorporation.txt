elects to convert all or any number of the shares of the Preferred Stock represented by such
certificate or certificates and, if applicable, any event on which such conversion is contingent.

wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued. If required by the
Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by a
written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly
executed by the registered holder or his, her or its attomey duly authorized in writing. The close
of business on the date of receipt by the transfer agent of such certificates (or lost certificate
affidavit and agreement) and notice (or by the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own
transfer agent) shall be the time of conversion (the “Conversion Time”), and the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the shares represented by such certificate shall be
deemed to be outstanding of record as of such date. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable
after the Conversion Time, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to
his, her or its nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to
which such holder shall be entitled, together with cash in lieu of any fraction of a share.

outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued stock, for the purpose of
effecting the conversion of the Preferred Stock, such number of its duly authorized shares of
Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding -
Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common
Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred
Stock, the Corporation shall take such corporate action as may be necessary to increase its
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient
for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite
stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to this Certificate of Incorporation. Before
taking any action which would cause an adjustment reducing the applicable Conversion Price
below the then par value of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the
Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its
counsel, be necessary in order that the Corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock at such adjusted applicable Conversion Price.

(iii) | All shares of Preferred Stock which shall have been surrendered for
conversion as herein provided shall no Jonger be deemed to be outstanding and all rights with

thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor and to receive payment of any
dividends declared but unpaid thereon. Any shares of Preferred Stock so converted shall be

the issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in which the
shares of Preferred Stock so converted were registered, and no such issuance or delivery shall be
made unless and until the person or entity requesting such issuance has paid to the Corporation the

amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax has
been paid.

(excluding Options or Convertible Securities which, upon exercise, conversion or
exchange thereof, would entitle the holder thereof to receive Exempted Securities)
or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities
entitled to receive any such Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum
number of shares of Common Stock (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto,
assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to exercisability, convertibility or
exchangeability but without regard to any provision contained therein for a
subsequent downward adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of
such Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities and Options therefor, the

Additional Shares of Common Stock issued as of the time of such issue or, in case

such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record
date.

(B) If the terms of any Option or Convertible Security, the

issuance of which resulted in an adjustment to the Conversion Price for any series of
Preferred Stock pursuant to the terms of Section B.5(a){iv) below, are revised (either

10709668.1
-16-

automatically pursuant to the provisions contained therein or as a result of an
amendment to such terms) to provide for either (1) any increase or decrease in the
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or
exchange of any such Option or Convertible Security or (2) any increase or decrease
in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion or
exchange, then, effective upon such increase or decrease becoming effective, the
Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock computed upon the original
issue of such Option or Convertible Security (or upon the occurrence of a record
date with respect thereto) shall be readjusted to such Conversion Price as would
have obtained had such revised terms been in effect upon the original date of
issuance of such Option or Convertible Security. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
adjustment pursuant to this clause (B) shall’ have the effect of increasing the
Conversion Price to an amount which exceeds the lower of (i) the Conversion Price
on the original adjustment date, or (ii) the Conversion Price that would have resulted
from any issuances of Additional Shares of Common Stock between the original
adjustment date and such readjustment date.

(C) If the terms of any Option or Convertible Security

exchange thereof, would entitle the holder thereof to receive Exempted Securities
the issuance of which did not result in an adjustment to the Conversion Price for any
series of Preferred Stock pursuant to the terms of Section B.5(aXiy) below (either
because the consideration per share (determined pursuant to Section B.5(a)(y)
hereof) of the Additional Shares of Common Stock subject thereto was equal to or
greater than the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock then in effect, or
because such Option or Convertible Security was issued before the Original Issue
Date), are revised after the Original Issue Date (either automatically pursuant to the
provisions contained therein or as a result of an amendment to such terms) to
provide for either (1) any increase or decrease in the number of shares of Common
Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any such Option or
Convertible Security or (2) any increase or decrease in the consideration payable to
the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion or exchange, then such Option or
Convertible Security, as so amended, and the Additional Shares of Common Stock
subject thereto (determined in the manner provided in Section B.5(aNiiiN A) above)
shall be deemed to have been issued effective upon such increase or decrease
becoming effective.

(D) Upon the expiration or termination of any unexercised
Option or unconverted or unexchanged Convertible Security which resulted (either
upon its original issuance or upon a revision of its terms) in an adjustment to the
Conversion Price pursuant to the terms of Section B.S(aXiv) below, such
Conversion Price shall be readjusted to such Conversion Price as would have
obtained had such Option or Convertible Security never been issued.

(iv) Vv i of Additional Sh

Common Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Original Issue Date issue ©
Additional Shares of Common Stock (including Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to

10709668.1
-17-

be issued pursuant to Section B.5(a}{iii)), without consideration or for a consideration per share
less than the Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such
issue, then such Conversion Price for each affected Series of Preferred Stock shall be reduced,
concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent)
determined in accordance with the following formula:

CP2 = CP; * (A+B)+(A+C)
For purposes of the foregoing formula, the following definitions shall apply:

“CP,” shall mean the applicable Conversion Price in effect immediately
after such issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock;

“CP,” shal] mean the applicable Conversion Price in effect immediately
prior to such issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock;

“A” shall mean the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding and
Deemed Outstanding (as defined below) immediately prior to such issue of
Additional Shares of Common Stock;

“B” shall mean the number of shares of Common Stock that would have
been issued if such Additional Shares of Common Stock had been issued at a
price per share equal to CP; (determined by dividing the aggregate consideration
received by the Corporation in respect of such issue by CP);

“C” shall mean the number of such Additional Shares of Common Stock
issued in such transaction; and

All shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding Options and
conversion or exchange of Convertible Securities shall be “Deemed Outstanding” for
purposes of this Section B.5(a}{iv).

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this Section B.5(a),
the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional Shares of Common
Stock shall be computed as follows:

(A) Cash and Property: Such consideration shall:

(I) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the aggregate
amount of cash received by the Corporation, excluding amounts paid or payable for accrued
interest;

-(II}__ insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be computed
at the fair market value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith by a

majority of the Board of Directors of the Corporation (with such majority including the Series B
Directors); and

(iI) in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock are issued
together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for consideration which

10709668.!
-18-

covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in

clauses (1) and (II) above, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation.
(B)  Qptions and Convertible Securities. The consideration

per share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock

deemed to have been issued pursuant to Section B.5(aXiii), relating to Options and
Convertible Securities, shall be determined by dividing

9) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the
Corporation as consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the
minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating
thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such
consideration) payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the

exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities, by

(I) ‘the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set forth
in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a
subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities.

(vi) Multiple Closing Dates. In the event the Corporation shall issue on
more than one date Additional Shares of Common Stock that are a part of one transaction or a
series of related transactions and that would result in an adjustment to the Conversion Price for
any series of Preferred Stock pursuant to the terms of Section B.5(a)iv) above, and such issuance
dates occur within a period of no more than 120 days from the first such issuance to the final such
issuance, then, upon the final such issuance, the Conversion Price for each affected series of
Preferred Stock shall be readjusted to give effect to all such issuances as if they occurred on the
date of the first such issuance (and without additional giving effect to any adjustments as a result
of any subsequent issuances pursuant to such series of related transactions within such period).

(b) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If the Corporation shall at
any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date effect a subdivision of the outstanding
Common Stock without a comparable subdivision of the Preferred Stock or combine the
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock without a comparable combination of the Common Stock,
the Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately before that
subdivision or combination shal] be proportionately decreased so that the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be increased in
proportion to such increase in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. If
the Corporation shall at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date combine the
outstanding shares of Common Stock without a comparable combination of the Preferred Stock
or effect a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock without a comparable
subdivision of the Common Stock, the Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock in
effect immediately before the combination or subdivision shall be proportionately increased so
that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series

10709668. !
-19-

shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in the aggregate number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding. Any adjustment under this subsection shall become effective at the close of
business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective.

(c) Adjustment for Certain Dividends and Distributions. Subject to the
provisions of Section B.1, in the event the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the
Original Issue Date shall make or issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of
Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable on the Common
Stock in additional shares of Common Stock, then and in each such event the Conversion Price
for each series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately before such event shall be decreased as
of the time of such issuance or, in the event such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the
close of business on such record date, by multiplying the applicable Conversion Price then in
effect by a fraction: .

. (i) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of
business on such record date, and

(ii) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the
close of business on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in
payment of such dividend or distribution;

provided, however, that if such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend is not fully
paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, each affected Conversion
Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record date and
thereafter the such Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this subsection: as of the time
of actual payment of such dividends or distributions; and provided further, however, that no such
adjustment shall be made if the holders of Preferred Stock simultaneously receive (i) a dividend
or other distribution of shares of Common Stock in a number equal to the number of shares of
Common Stock as they would have received if all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock had
been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event or (ii) a dividend or other
distribution of shares of Preferred Stock which are convertible, as of the date of such event, into
such number of shares of Common Stock as is equal to the number of additional shares of

Common Stock being issued with respect to each share of Common Stock in such dividend or
distribution. :

(d) Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. ‘Subject to the
provisions of Section B.], in the event the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the
Original Issue Date shall make or issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of
capital stock of the Corporation entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in
securities of the Corporation (other than a distribution of shares of Common Stock in respect of
outstanding shares of Common Stock) or in other property, then and in cach such event the
holders of Preferred Stock shall receive, simultaneously with the distribution to the holders of
such capital stock, a dividend or other distribution of-such securities or other property in an
amount equal to a rate per share for the Preferred Stock determined by dividing the amount of
the dividend payable on each share of such class or series of capital stock by the original

16709668. 1
-20-

issuance price of such class or series of capital stock and multiplying such fraction by an amount

equal to the applicable Original Issue Price, in each case calculated on the record date for
determination of holders entitled to receive such dividend.

(ec) Adjustment for Merger or Reorganization, etc. Subject to the provisions
of Section B.2, if there shall occur any reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
consolidation or merger involving the Corporation in which the Common Stock (but not the
Preferred Stock) is converted into.or exchanged for securities, cash or other property (other than
a transaction covered by subsections (b), (c) or (d) of this Section B.5), then, following any such
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger, each share of Preferred
Stock shall thereafter be convertible in lieu of the Common Stock into which it was convertible
prior to such event into the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property which a holder
of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation issuable upon conversion of one
share of Preferred Stock immediately prior to such reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, consolidation or merger would have been entitled to receive pursuant to such
transaction, and, in such case, appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith by majority of
the Board of Directors of the Corporation with such majority including the Series C Director and
the Series B Directors) shall be made in the application of the provisions in this Section B.5 with
respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the holders of the Preferred Stock, to the end that
the provisions set forth in this Section B.5 (including provisions with respect to changes in and
other adjustments of the applicable Conversion Price) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as

reasonably may be, in relation to any securities or other property thereafter deliverable upon the
conversion of the Preferred Stock.

(f) Notice of Record Date. In the event:

(i) the Corporation shall take a record of the holders of its Common Stock
(or other stock or securities at the time issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock) for the
purpose of entitling or enabling them to receive any ‘dividend or other distribution, or to receive
any right to subscribe for or purchase any shares of stock of any class or any other securities, or to
receive any other right; or

(ii) of any capital reorganization of the Corporation, any reclassification of
the Common Stock of the Corporation, or any Deemed Liquidation Event; or

(iii) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of
the Corporation,

then, and in each such case, the Corporation will send or cause to be sent to the holders of the
Preferred Stock a notice specifying, as the case may be, (i) the record date for such dividend,
distribution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right, or (ii)
the effective date on which such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer,
dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is proposed to take place, and the time, if any is to be
fixed, as of which the holders of record of Common Stock (or such other stock or securities at
the time issuable upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be entitled to exchange their
shares of Common Stock (or such other stock or securities) for securities or other property
deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer,

10709668.1
-21-

dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, and the amount per share and character of such exchange
applicable to the Preferred Stock and the Common Stock. Such notice shall be sent at least ten
(10) days prior to the record date or effective date for the event specified in such notice. Any
notice required by the provisions hereof to be given to a holder of shares of Preferred Stock shall
be deemed sent to such holder if deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, and
addressed to such holder at his, her or its address appearing on the books of the Corporation.
