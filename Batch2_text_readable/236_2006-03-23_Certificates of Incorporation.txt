thereafter to convert such shares into the kind and amounts of shares of stock and other secunties
and property receivable upon such reorganization, reclassification or other change, by holders of

authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as are sufficient to
enable it to validly and Jegally issue the shares of its Common Stock that are tssuable based upon
such adjusted Series B Conversion Ratio or Series A Conversion Ratio, as applicable.
