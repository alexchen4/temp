would be distributed to such holder if such holder did not convert such series of Preferred Stock
into shares of Common Stock. If any such holder shall be deemed to have converted shares of
Preferred Stock into Common Stock pursuant to this paragraph, then such holder shall not be

transactions shall not constitute a Liquidation Event if the same is (are) consummated principally
for bona fide equity financing purposes in which cash is received by this corporation or

may be waived by the vote or written consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class and not as separate series, and on an as-
converted basis).

the fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by this corporation and the holders of at

GDSVF&H\818197.4 5
(B) ‘The method of valuation of securities subject to investment
letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of
a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount
from the market value determined as above in (A) (1), (2) or (3) to reflect the approximate fair
market value thereof, as mutually determined by this corporation and the holders of at least a
majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of such Preferred Stock (voting

provided for herein or sooner than ten (10) days after this corporation has given notice of any
material changes provided for herein; provided, however, that such periods may be shortened,
and the notice requirements described in this subsection (iv) may be waived, upon the
affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of Preferred Stock that (i) are entitled to such

the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (voting together as a
single class and not as separate series, and on an as-converted basis); provided that if such

converted to Common Stock, the Series E Preferred Stock and Series E-1 Preferred Stock shall
not be so converted unless the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of

event of loss thereof), at the office of this corporation or of any transfer agent for the Preferred
Stock, and shall give written notice to this corporation at its principal corporate office, of the
election to convert the same and shall state therein the name or names in which the certificate or
certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued. This corporation shall, as soon as
practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to the
nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of
Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid. Such conversion shall be
deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such
surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to
receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all
purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock as of such date. Ifthe
conversion is in connection with an underwritten offering of securities registered pursuant to the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering
Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale
of securities pursuant to such offering, in which event the persons entitled to receive the
Common Stock upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed the record holder or
holders of such shares of Common Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of
securities. If the conversion is in connection with Automatic Conversion provisions of
subsection 4(b)(ii) above, such conversion shall be deemed to have been made on the conversion
date described in the stockholder consent approving such conversion, and the persons entitled to
receive shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes
as the record holders of such shares of Common Stock as of such date.

Issuances, Splits and Combinations. The Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock shall be
subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

this Restated Certificate of Incorporation is accepted for filing by the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware (the “Filing Date”), any Additional Stock (as defined below) without
consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Conversion Price applicable to a
series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock, the
Conversion Price for such series in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall forthwith
(except as otherwise provided in this clause (i)) be adjusted to a price determined by multiplying
such Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Stock Outstanding immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares of
Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received by this corporation for such issuance
would purchase at such Conversion Price; and the denominator of which shall be the number of
shares of Common Stock Outstanding immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of
shares of such Additional Stock. For purposes of this Section 4(d)(i)(A), the term “Common
Stock Outstanding” shall mean and include the following: (1) outstanding Common Stock,
(2) Common Stock issuable upon conversion of outstanding Preferred Stock, (3) Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options, and (4) Common Stock issuable upon

(3) years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward, or shall
be made at the end of three (3) years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment
being carried forward, whether or not made in connection with another adjustment event. Except

Conversion Price pursuant to this subsection 4(d)(i) shall have the effect of increasing the
Conversion Price of a particular series of Preferred Stock above the Conversion Price in effect
for such series of Preferred Stock immediately prior to such adjustment.

- {C) In the case of the issuance of Common Stock for cash, the
consideration shal] be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting any
reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by this
corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

(D) In the case of the issuance of the Common Stock for a
_ consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be

corporation for any such securities and related options or rights (excluding any cash received on

or exchange of such securities.

rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Conversion Price of the

the conversion or exchange of such securities or upon the exercise of the options or rights related
to such securities.
