ARGOS THERAPEUTICS, INC., a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware,

hereby certifies as follows:

1. The name of the Company is ARGOS THERAPEUTICS, INC. The Company’s original Certificate of
Incorporation was filed on May 8, 1997 under the name “Dendritix, Inc.”. The Company’s Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation was filed on April 11, 2001 and was subsequently amended (the
Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of incorporation as so amended, the “Old Restated
Certificate’).

2. Pursuant to Section 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, this Third
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation restates and integrates and further amends the provisions
of the Old Restated Certificate.

3. The terms and provisions of this Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation have been duly
approved by vote of the required number of shares of each outstanding class of stock of this Company
pursuant to Subsection 242 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “General

4. The text of the Old Restated Certificate is as hereby restated and further amended to read in its entirety as

follows:
1. NAME
The name of the Company shall be ARGOS THERAPEUTICS, Inc.
2. ADDRESS

The address of the registered office of the Company in the State of Delaware is 2711 Centerville Road Suite 400,

Company.

3. PURPOSE

The purpose for which the Company is organized is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations

4. STOCK

4.1 Authorization of Stock. The total number of shares of all classes of stock which the Company shall have
authority to issue pursuant to this Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (this “Restated
Certificate”) is 377,591,089, of which (i) 220,000,000 shares are of a class designated “Common Stock”, $0.001
par value (the “Common”), and (ii) 157,591,089 shares are of a class designated “Preferred Stock”, $0.001 par
value (the “Preferred”), of which 1,648,253 shares are of a series of such class designated “Series A Preferred
Stock” (the “Series A Preferred”), 31,060,286 shares are of a series of such class designated “Series B Preferred
Stock” (the “Series B Preferred”), 3,671,086 shares are of a series of such class designated “Series B-1 Preferred
Stock” (the “Series B-1 Preferred”), and 121,211,464 shares are of a series of such class designated “Series C
Preferred Stock” (the “Series C Preferred”).

Upon the filing of this Restated Certificate (the time of such filing the “Effective Time” and the date of such
filing the “Filing Date”), each share of the Company’s Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, outstanding at
the Effective Time (the “Old Common Stock”), shall be combined, reclassified and changed into 0.01 fully paid
and nonassessable share of Common without any action on the part of the holder thereof (the “Recapitalization”).
All shares of Common issued to any holder of Old Common Stock as a result of the Recapitalization shall be
aggregated for the purpose of determining the number of shares of Common to which such holder shall be entitled,
and no fractional shares shall be issued in connection with the Recapitalization. Any stockholder who would
otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share of Common as a result of the Recapitalization shall receive in lieu
thereof cash in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by $0.289018. At and after the Effective Time, each
outstanding certificate that prior thereto represented shares of Old Common Stock shall be deemed for all purposes
to evidence ownership of and to represent that whole number of shares of Common into which the shares
represented by such certificate shall have been combined, reclassified and changed as herein provided, plus the right
to receive cash in lieu of, any fractional share as described above. Until any such outstanding stock certificate shall
have been surrendered for transfer or otherwise accounted for to the Company, the registered owner thereof on the
books and records of the Company shall have and be entitled to exercise any voting and other rights with respect to,
and to receive any dividend and other distributions upon, the shares of Common issuable to the holder thereof upon
surrender of such certificate. No cash in lieu of any fractional share shall be paid to any stockholder until such
stockholder shall have surrendered for transfer or otherwise accounted to the Company for the outstanding stock
certificates entitling such stockholder to such cash.

4.2 Powers and Qualifications of Common Stock. The voting, dividend and liquidation rights of the holders of the
Common Stock are subject to and qualified by the rights, powers and preferences of the holders of the Preferred
Stock set forth herein, and are as follows:

4.2.1 Voting Rights. Except as otherwise required by law or expressly provided in this Restated Certificate, each
share of Common (including any fractional share) shall entitle the holder thereof to vote on each matter
submitted to a vote of the shareholders of the Company and to have one vote for each full share of Common
(or the applicable fraction of one vote, for a fraction of a share); provided, however, that, except as otherwise
required by law, holders of Common, as such, shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to the Restated
Certificate that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred if the holders of such
affected series are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to
vote thereon pursuant to the Restated Certificate or pursuant to the General Corporation Law. The number of
authorized shares of Common may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then
outstanding) by (in addition to any vote of the holders of one or more series of Preferred that may be required
by the terms of the Restated Certificate) the affirmative vote of the holders of shares of capital stock of the
Corporation representing a majority of the votes represented by all outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Company entitled to vote, irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the General Corporation Law.
Except as otherwise required by law or expressly provided in this Restated Certificate, the holders of shares of
Common and Preferred shall vote together and not as separate classes or series.

Restated Certificate and except as otherwise provided herein, the holders of Common shall be entitled to
receive dividends out of funds legally available therefor at such times and in such amounts as the Board of
Directors may determine in its sole discretion; provided, however, that no dividends may be declared on
outstanding shares of Common unless such dividends also shall have been declared on all outstanding
Preferred.

4.2.3 Liquidation. Upon the dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or
involuntary, including but not limited to any transaction under Section 4.3.3.4,4.4.3.4,4.5.3.4 and 4.6.3.4, the

preferential amounts pursuant to Sections 4.3.3.1,4.4.3.1,4.5.3.1 and 4.6,3.1 of this Restated Certificate, shall
be distributed ratably to all holders of Common and Preferred in accordance with the provisions of Sections

number (including any fraction) of shares of Common into which such share of Series A Preferred is then
convertible pursuant to the provisions hereof at the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to
vote on such matter or, if no such record date is established, at the date such vote is taken or any written
consent of shareholders becomes effective. Except as otherwise required by law or expressly provided in this

adjusted proportionately in the event the shares of Series A Preferred are subdivided into a greater number or
combined into a lesser number) per annum, payable out of funds legally available therefor. Such dividends
shall be payable only when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors and shall be non-cumulative. The
“Series A Original Purchase Price” shall be $1.00.

-3-

4.3.2.2 No dividends (other than those payable on Common solely in shares of Common) shall be paid on
any shares of Common during any fiscal year of the Company until dividends in the total amount determined
in accordance with Section 4,3.2.1 (adjusted in accordance therewith, if applicable) on the Series A
Preferred, shall have been paid or declared and set apart during that fiscal year, and no dividends (other than
those payable on Common solely in shares of Common) shall be paid on any share of Common, unless a
dividend is paid with respect to all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred in an amount for each such share
of Series A Preferred equal to or greater than the aggregate amount of such dividends for all shares of
Common into which each such share of Series A Preferred could then be converted.

4.3.2.3 In the event any dividend or other distribution payable in cash or other property (other than securities
of the Company the issuance of which gives rise to adjustments pursuant to Section 4.3.4.4 of this Restated
Certificate) is declared on any Common, each holder of shares of Series A Preferred on the record date for
such dividend or distribution shall be entitled to receive, in addition to any dividend under Section 4.3.2.1,
on the date of payment or distribution of such dividend or other distribution the same cash or other property
which such holder would have received on such record date if such holder were the holder of record of the
number (including any fraction) of shares of Common into which the shares of Series A Preferred then held .
by such holder are then convertible.

4.3.2.4 In the event a holder of Series A Preferred, (i) executes the Series C . Preferred Stock Purchase
Agreement by and among the Company and the Purchasers named therein dated on or about the Filing Date
(the “Series C Purchase Agreement”) and commits to purchase thereunder an amount of Series C Preferred
having an aggregate purchase price at least equal to such holder’s Pro Rata Share as set forth opposite such
holder’s name on Exhibit A-3 to the Series C Purchase Agreement (such holder’s “Pro Rata Share”), and
(11) at the Initial Closing (as defined in the Series C Purchase Agreement; hereafter, the “Initial Closing”)
purchases the amount of Series C Preferred allocated to such holder as set forth opposite such holder’s name
under the heading “Cash Initial Shares” on Exhibit A-1 to the Series C Purchase Agreement, then at the
Initial Closing such holder shall be issued a number of additional shares of Series A Preferred equal to the
greatest whole number obtained by dividing the aggregate amount of the dividends that have accrued on
such holder’s shares of Series A Preferred through January 31, 2008 under the Old Restated Certificate but
have not been paid, whether or not declared, by the Series A Original Purchase Price. All other dividends
that have accrued on such holder’s shares of Series A Preferred through the Effective Time under the Old
Restated Certificate but have not been paid shall be cancelled. In determining whether any holder of Series A
Preferred has satisfied the criteria set forth in clause (i) of this Section 4.3.2.4, any purchases of Series C
Preferred under the Series C Purchase Agreement by a Related Party (as defined below) of such holder that
are in excess of the Pro Rata Share of such Related Party shall, to the extent requested by such holder, be
attributed to such holder; provided that no shares constituting part of such excess shall be attributed to more
than one holder of Preferred. The term “Related Party” means with respect to a Company stockholder (a)
such stockholder’s affiliate, (b) if such stockholder is a venture capital or other investment fund, such
stockholder’s exclusive provider of investment management or investment advisory services (a “Manager”),
such Manager’s affiliates, any other venture capital or investment fund to which such Manager or its
affiliates provide exclusive investment management or investment advisory services, and any other venture

4.3.3.1 Subject to the rights of holders of Series B Preferred pursuant to the provisions of Section 4.4.3,
holders of Series B-1 Preferred pursuant to the provisions of Section 4,5.3 and holders of Series C Preferred
pursuant to the provisions of Section 4.6.3, if the Company shall be voluntarily or involuntarily liquidated,
dissolved or wound up, the holder of each share of Series A Preferred then outstanding (including any
fractional shares) shall be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Company available for distribution to
shareholders, and before any payment or declaration and setting apart for payment of any amount shall be
made with respect to the Common, an amount equal to (i) 100% of the Series A Original Purchase Price

a greater number or combined into a lesser number), plus (ii) an amount equal to any dividends on such
share which are declared but unpaid as of such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company.

4.3.3.2 If, upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or
involuntary, and subject to payment to holders of Series B Preferred of the full preferential amount pursuant
to Section 4.4.3.1, holders of Series B-1 Preferred of the full preferential amount pursuant to Section 4.5.3.1
and holders of Series C Preferred of the full preferential amount pursuant to Section 4.6.3.1, the assets to be
distributed to the holders of Series A Preferred shall be insufficient to permit the payment of the full

assets of the Company to be distributed shall be distributed ratably to the holders of Series A Preferred.

4.3.3.3 Upon the dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary,

Certificate, shall be distributed ratably to all holders of Common and Preferred on an “as-converted basis”.

4.3.3 4 For purposes of this Restated Certificate, including without limitation Sections 4.6.3, 4.5.3, 4.4.3 and
4.3.3, unless waived by the holders of at least 60% of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred, each of
the following events shall be treated as a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company and shall
entitle the holders of shares of all series of Preferred and Common to receive at the closing in cash, securities
or other property (valued as provided in Sections 4.3.3.5, 4.4.3.5,4.5.3.5 and 4.6.3.5) the amounts specified
in Sections 4.3.3.1 through 4.3.3.5, 4.4.3.1 through 4.4.3.5, 4.5.3.1 through 4.5.3.5 and 4.6.3.1 through

ownership of more than 50% of the equity of the acquiring corporation by shareholders of the Company) or
(ii) a sale of the voting control of the Company or (iii) a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company. The sale of shares of Series C Preferred pursuant to the Series C Purchase Agreement shall not be
treated as a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company.

4.3.3.5 Whenever the distribution provided for in this Section 4.3.3 shall be payable in securities or property
other than cash, the value of such distribution shall be the fair market value of such securities or other property
as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

4.3.4 Conversion.

4.3.4.1 Terms of Conversion.

4.3.4.1.1 Optional Conversion. The holder of each share of Series A Preferred shall have the right
(the “Series A Conversion Right”), at such holder’s option, to convert such share at any time,
without cost and otherwise on the terms of this Section 4.3.4, into the number of fully paid and non-
assessable shares of Common that results from dividing:

(A) $1.00,
by:
(B) the Series A Conversion Price in effect at the time of conversion.

The “Series A Conversion Price” shall initially be $1.00 and shall be subject to adjustment
from time to time as provided in this Section 4.3.4.
(a)

(b)

4.3.4.1.2 Mandatory Conversion. All of the outstanding Series A Preferred shall, without any further
action by a holder thereof, convert into Common (a “Series A Mandatory Conversion’) upon the
first to occur of the following (each a “Series A Mandatory Conversion Event”): (A) the
Company’s Qualified Public Offering, (B) at such time as at least two-thirds of the aggregate number
of shares of Series A Preferred issued prior to such time have been voluntarily converted into
Common by the holders thereof, (C) at such time as is specified in a vote or written consent of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred, or (D) at such time as is
specified in a vote or written consent of the holders of at least 60% of the outstanding shares of
Series C Preferred with respect to the conversion of all Preferred into Common. In each case each
share of Series A Preferred shall be automatically converted, without cost, on the terms of this
Section 4.3.4, into the number of shares of Common into which such share of Series A Preferred
would be convertible under Section 4.3.4.1.1 immediately prior to such conversion. As used in this
Restated Certificate, “Qualified Public Offering” means the closing of a firm commitment
underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act
of 1933, covering the offer and sale of Common for the account of the Company to the public at a
price per share of not less than three times the Series C Original Purchase Price (as adjusted for stock
splits, dividends and the like) with aggregate proceeds to the Company of not less than $30,000,000
(before deduction of underwriters commissions and expenses).

-6-

4.3.4.1.3 Pay to Play Conversion.
Concurrently with the Initial Closing, each share of Series A Preferred outstanding at the time of
the Initial Closing shall automatically convert into 0.01 share of Common except as expressly
provided under this paragraph (a). Each share of Series A Preferred issued after the Initial Closing
upon the exercise of a warrant outstanding at the time of the Initial Closing shall immediately
upon issuance convert into 0.01 share of Common except as expressly provided under this
paragraph (a). The foregoing conversion to Common shall not occur with respect to any share of
Series A Preferred if the holder of such share of Series A Preferred or warrant to purchase Series
A Preferred (i) executes the Series C Purchase Agreement and commits to purchase thereunder an
amount of Series C Preferred having an aggregate purchase price at least equal to such holder’s
Pro Rata Share as set forth opposite such holder’s name on Exhibit A-3 to the Series C Purchase
Agreement, and (ii) at the Initial Closing purchases the amount of Series C Preferred allocated to
such holder as set forth opposite such holder’s name under the heading “Cash Initial Shares” on
Exhibit A-1 to the Series C Purchase Agreement. Following the conversion of such shares of
Series A Preferred, the holder thereof shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor at the
office of the Company or any transfer agent for the Series A Preferred. Upon such surrender, the
Company shall issue and deliver to such holder, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a
certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common to which such holder is entitled. If
a holder’s shares of Series A Preferred are converted pursuant to this Section 4.3.4.1.3(a), then
notwithstanding that the certificates evidencing such shares shall not have been surrendered, all
rights with respect to such shares shall terminate at the Initial Closing, except only the right of the
holder to receive certificates evidencing the shares of Common upon surrender of the certificate
evidencing such converted shares of Series A Preferred. Any dividends or distributions accrued
but unpaid at the time of conversion with respect to a share of Series A Preferred so converted
pursuant to this Section 4.3.4.1.3(a), whether declared or not, shall be cancelled. In determining
whether any holder of Series A Preferred has satisfied the criteria set forth in clause (i) of this
Section 4.3.4.1.3(a), any purchases of Series C Preferred under the Series C Purchase Agreement
by a Related Party of such holder that are in excess of the Pro Rata Share of such Related Party
shall, to the extent requested by such holder, be attributed to such holder; provided that no shares
constituting part of such excess shall be attributed to more than one holder of Preferred.

-7-

If the Milestone Closing (as defined in the Series C Purchase, Agreement; hereafter, the
“Milestone Closing”) occurs and a holder of Series A Preferred does not purchase the number of
Milestone Shares (as defined in the Series C Purchase Agreement; hereafter, the “Milestone
Shares”) allocated to such holder under the Series C Purchase Agreement, then concurrently with
the Milestone Closing (i) each share of Series A Preferred issued to such holder pursuant to
Section 4.3.2.4 shall automatically be redeemed pursuant to the terms of Section 4.5 of the Series
C Purchase Agreement and (ii) each other share of Series A Preferred held by such holder, or held
by such holder at the time of the initial Closing and subsequently transferred, shall automatically
convert into 0.01 share of Common. Promptly following the Milestone Closing, the holder of
shares so redeemed or converted shall surrender the certificates therefor at the office of the
Company or any transfer agent for the Series A Preferred. In the case of converted shares, upon
such surrender the Company shall issue and deliver to such holder, or to the nominee or nominees
of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common to which such
holder is entitled. If a holder’s shares of Series A Preferred are redeemed or converted pursuant to
this Section 4.3.4.1.3(b), then notwithstanding that the certificates evidencing such shares shall
not have been surrendered, all rights with respect to such shares shall terminate at the Milestone
Closing, except only the right of the holder upon surrender of the certificates evidencing such
converted shares to receive certificates evidencing the shares of Common issued upon such
conversion. In determining whether any holder of Series A Preferred has purchased the number of
Milestone Shares allocated to such holder under the Series C Purchase Agreement, any purchases
of Milestone Shares under the Series C Purchase Agreement by a Related Party of such holder
that are in excess of the Milestone Shares allocated to such Related Party under the Series C
Purchase Agreement shall, to the extent requested by such holder, be attributed to such holder;
provided that no shares constituting part of such excess shall be attributed to more than one
holder of Preferred.

(c) All shares of Common issued to any holder of Series A Preferred as a result of conversion
pursuant to this Section 4.3.4.1.3 shall be aggregated for the purpose of determining the number
of shares of Common to which such holder shall be entitled, and no fractional shares shall be
issued in connection with such conversion. Any stockholder who would otherwise be entitled to
receive a fractional share of Common as a result of such conversion shall receive in lieu thereof
cash in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the Series C Original Purchase Price (as
defined below).

4.3.4.2 Mechanics of Conversion.

4.3.4.2.1 Optional Conversion. A holder of any share of Series A Preferred may exercise the Series A
Conversion Right of such share by surrendering the certificate therefor, duly endorsed, at the office
of the Company or of any transfer agent for the Series A Preferred, together with a written notice to
the Company which states:

(A) that such holder elects to convert the same,
-8-

(B) the number of shares of Series A Preferred being converted, and

(C) the name or names in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of
Common to be issued.

Thereupon the Company shall promptly issue and deliver to the holder of such shares, or to the
nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of
Common to which such holder shall be entitled. If the certificate evidencing the shares of Series
A Preferred being converted shall also evidence shares of Series A Preferred not being
converted, then the Company shall also deliver to the holder of such certificate, or to the
nominee or nominees of such holder, a new stock certificate evidencing the Series A Preferred
not converted. Any dividends or distributions declared but unpaid at the time of conversion with
respect to a share of Series A Preferred so converted shall be payable ratably to the holders of
the Common issued upon such conversion.

4.3.4.2.2 Mandatory Conversion. The Company shall give written notice to each holder of a share of
Series A Preferred (A) not more than forty (40) nor less than twenty (20) days before the anticipated
effective date of the registration statement with respect to any Qualified Public Offering, and shall
also give written notice to each such holder upon the occurrence of any Qualified Public Offering;
and (B) upon the occurrence of any other Series A Mandatory Conversion Event. Following the
conversion of such shares, each holder of shares so converted may surrender the certificate therefor
at the office of the Company or any transfer agent for the Series A Preferred. Upon such surrender,
the Company shall issue and deliver to each holder, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a
certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common to which such holder is entitled. Any
dividends or distributions declared but unpaid at the time of conversion with respect to a share of
Series A Preferred so converted shall be payable ratably to the holders of the Common issued upon
such conversion.

4.3.4.3 Effective Date of Conversion.

4.3.4.3.1 Optional Conversion. The conversion of any shares of Series A Preferred shall be deemed

to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date that the shares to be

converted are surrendered to the Company together with the notice required by Section 4.3.4,2.1, and

the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common issuable upon such conversion shall

be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common on such date.
-9-

4.3.4.3.2 Mandatory Conversion. The conversion of shares of Series A Preferred shall take place
upon the first to occur of the Series A Mandatory Conversion Events, whether or not the certificates
representing such shares of Series A Preferred shall have been surrendered or new certificates
representing the shares of Common into which such shares have been converted shall have been
issued.

4.3.44 Adjustment of Conversion Price.

4.3.4.4.1 Subdivision or Combination of Shares. If the Company at any time subdivides or combines
the outstanding Common after the Filing Date, the Series A Conversion Price shall be decreased, in
the case of a subdivision, or increased, in the case of a combination, in the same proportions as the
Common is subdivided or combined, effective automatically as of the date the Company shall take a
record of the holders of its Common for the purpose of the subdivision or combination (or if no such
record is taken, as of the effectiveness of the subdivision or combination).

4.3.4.4.2 Stock Dividends. If the Company at any time pays a dividend, or makes any other
distribution, to holders of Common payable in shares of Common, or fixes a record date for the
determination of holders of Common entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in
shares of Common, the Series A Conversion Price shall be decreased by multiplying it by a fraction:

(A) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common outstanding
immediately prior to such dividend or distribution, and

(B) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common outstanding
immediately after such dividend or distribution (plus, if the Company paid cash instead of
fractional shares otherwise issuable in such dividend or distribution, the number of additional
shares which would have been outstanding had the Company issued fractional shares instead of
cash),

effective automatically as of the date the Company shall take a record of the holders of its
Common for the purpose of receiving such dividend or distribution (or if no such record is
taken, as of the effectiveness of such dividend or distribution).

4.3.44.3 Reclassification, Consolidation or Merger. If at any time, as a result of:

(A) a capital reorganization or reclassification (other than a subdivision, combination or
dividend which gives rise to adjustment of the Series A Conversion Price pursuant to Sections
4344.1 or 4.3.44.2), or

-10-

(B) a merger or consolidation of the Company with another corporation (whether or not the
Company is the surviving corporation),
the Common issuable upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred shall be changed into or
exchanged for the same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock of the
Company or any other corporation, or other securities convertible into such shares, then, as a
part of such reorganization, reclassification, merger or consolidation, appropriate adjustments
shall be made in the terms of the Series A Preferred (or of any securities into which the Series A
Preferred is changed or for which the Series A Preferred is exchanged), so that:

(X) the holders of Series A Preferred or of such substitute securities shall thereafter be entitled to
receive, upon conversion of the Series A Preferred or of such substitute securities, the kind and
amount of shares of stock, other securities, money and property which such holders would have
received at the time of such capital reorganization, reclassification, merger, or consolidation, if
such holders had converted their Series A Preferred into Common immediately prior to such
capital reorganization, reclassification, merger, or consolidation, and

(Y) the Series A Preferred or such substitute securities shall thereafter be adjusted on terms as
nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments theretofore provided in this Section
4344.

The provisions of this Section 4.3.4.4.3 shall similarly apply to successive capital
reorganizations, reclassifications, mergers, and consolidations.

4.3.4.4.4 Additional Shares of Common.

(A) As used in this Restated Certificate, the term “Additional Shares of Common” means all
shares of Common issued by the Company, or deemed to be issued pursuant to Section 4.3.4.4.5,
after the Filing Date, whether or not subsequently reacquired or retired by the Company, other
than:

(1) shares of Common issued in transactions giving rise to adjustments under Sections
43441,4344.2,43443,44441,4444.2,44443,4544.1,45442,454.4.3,
4644.1,4644.2 or 4.6443

(2) shares of Common issued upon conversion of shares of Series A Preferred, Series B
Preferred, Series B-1 Preferred or Series C Preferred,

(3) up to 36,833,374 shares of Common issued upon the exercise of any options granted to
employees or directors of, or consultants to, the Company as compensation for services
rendered to the Company pursuant to one or more option plans approved by the affirmative
vote or written consent of the Board of Directors, (such amount to be adjusted
proportionately in the event shares of Common are subdivided into a greater number or
combined into a lesser number),

-1l-

(4) shares of Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred, or Series B-1 Preferred issued pursuant
to Section 4.3.2.4, 4.4.2.4 or 4.5.2.4, (and the shares of Common issued upon the conversion
thereof),

(5) up to 118,601,031 shares of Series C Preferred issued pursuant to the Series C Purchase
Agreement,

(6) up to 54,469 shares of Common and 2,694,594 shares of Series B Preferred issued upon
the exercise of warrants described in the Disclosure Schedule to the Series C Purchase
Agreement (such amounts to be adjusted proportionately in the event shares of Common are
subdivided in to a greater number or combined into a lesser number),

(7) securities issuable to The Rockefeller University, Baylor Research Institute, Friedrich
Alexander Universitat Erlangen or their respective affiliates as milestone payments in
connection

with FDA or similar filings relating to products utilizing intellectual property licensed from
any such person by the Company, so long as such issuance is approved by the Company’s
Board of Directors, which approval shall include the approval of at least four directors
designated pursuant to Sections 9.1.1 through 9.1.6 of the Third Amended and Restated
Stockholders’ Agreement by and among the Company and the other parties thereto dated on
or about the Filing Date,

(8) up to 1,679,073 shares of Series B Preferred and up to 2,610,433 shares of Series C
Preferred, each issued as consideration for the exchange of shares of DC Bio Corp. pursuant
to that certain Amended and Restated Put Agreement, by and among the Company, DC Bio
Corp., and the other parties thereto dated on or about the Filing Date.

(B) If at any time the Company issues (or is deemed by the express provisions of Section
4.3.4.4.5 to have issued or sold) Additional Shares of Common without consideration or for a
consideration per share less than the lower of (i) the Series A Conversion Price in effect at such
issuance or (ii) the Series C Conversion Price in effect at such issuance, then the Series A
Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issuance, to a price (calculated to the
nearest cent) equal to the price determined by multiplying the Series A Conversion Price by a
fraction:

(1) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Outstanding
immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Shares of Common plus the number of
shares of Common which the aggregate consideration received (or by the express provisions
hereof deemed to have been received) by the Company for the total number of such
Additional Shares of Common so issued would purchase at the Series A Conversion Price,
and

-12-

(2) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Outstanding
immediately after the issuance of such Additional Shares of Common;

provided, however, that in no event shall the Series A Conversion Price be reduced below $.01.

(C) The term “Common Outstanding” shall include all Common issued and outstanding and
issuable upon exercise or conversion of all outstanding Convertible Securities. In the case of
Convertible Securities which are, by their terms, convertible into securities that have not yet
been authorized or designated or which are convertible into, or exercisable for, securities at a
conversion rate or exercise price (or into or for a corresponding number of shares of Common)
which may not be determined at the time of the determination under Section 4.3.4.4.4(B), such
Convertible Securities shall be deemed to be converted or exercised based upon a rate or price
(and for a number of shares of Common) reflecting: (i) if such Convertible Securities have a
provision which contains a price or rate which is fixed or can be fixed as of the date of the
determination under Section 4.3.4.4.4(B), then such price or rate or (ii) otherwise, at the price of
securities issued in the Company’s most recent equity financing.

4.3.4.4.5 Convertible Securities.

(A) As used in this Restated Certificate, the term “Convertible Securities” means all rights or
options for the purchase of, or stock or other securities convertible Into or exchangeable for,
Additional Shares of Common or other Convertible Securities.

-13-

(B) For the purpose of the adjustment required under Section 4.3.4.4.4 with respect to Series A
Preferred, Section 4.4.4.4.4 with respect to Series B Preferred, Section 4.5.4.4.4 with respect to
Series B-1 Preferred or Section 4.6.4.4.4 with respect to Series C Preferred, if at any time or
from time to time after the first date of issuance of any Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred,
Series B-1 Preferred or Series C Preferred, as applicable, the Company issues or sells
Convertible Securities (other than options or rights exercisable for or convertible into shares of
Common referred to in clauses (3), (6) and (8) of the definition of Additional Shares of Common
Stock), then in each case the Company shall be deemed to have issued at the time of the issuance
of such Convertible Securities the maximum number of Additional Shares of Common Stock (as
set forth in the instruments relating thereto, giving effect to any provision contained therein for a
subsequent upward adjustment of such number) issuable upon exercise or conversion thereof
and to have received as consideration therefor an amount equal to the total amount of the
consideration, if any, received by the Company for the issuance of such Convertible Securities
plus the minimum amounts of consideration, if any (as set forth in the instruments relating
thereto, giving effect to any provision contained therein for a subsequent downward adjustment
of such consideration), payable to the Company upon the exercise or conversion of such
Convertible Securities and the minimum amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the
Company (other than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible
Securities which were deemed to have been received by the Company on issuance of such
Convertible Securities) upon the exercise of any Convertible Securities issuable upon the
exercise or conversion of such Convertible Securities. No further adjustment of the Conversion
Price for Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred, Series B-1 Preferred or Series C Preferred, as
applicable, adjusted upon the issuance of such Convertible Securities, shall be made as a result
of the actual issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock on the exercise or the conversion
of any such Convertible Securities; provided, however, that if the Convertible Securities or the
conversion privilege represented by any such Convertible Securities shall expire without having
been exercised, or are exercised for a lesser number of Additional Shares of Common Stock or
with a greater consideration paid to the Company than was previously deemed to be issued or
received by the Company, the Conversion Price for Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred,
Series B-1 Preferred or Series C Preferred, as applicable, adjusted upon the issuance of such
Convertible Securities shall be readjusted to the Conversion Price for Series A Preferred, Series
B Preferred, Series B-1 Preferred or Series C Preferred, as applicable, which would have been in
effect had an adjustment been made on the basis that the only Additional Shares of Common
Stock so issued were the Additional Shares of Common Stock, if any, actually issued or sold on
the exercise or conversion of such Convertible Securities, and such Additional Shares of
Common Stock, if any, were issued or sold for the consideration actually received by the
Company upon such exercise, plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the Company
for the granting of all such Convertible Securities constituting warrants or options, whether or
not exercised, plus the consideration received for issuing or selling the Convertible Securities
actually converted plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the Company (other than
by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities which were
deemed to have been received by the Company on issuance of such Convertible Securities) on
the conversion of such Convertible Securities.

-14-

4.3.4.4.6 Valuation of Consideration. For purposes of the operation of Sections 4.3.4.44,4.34.4.5,
44444,44445,45444,4544.5,4.6.4.44 and 4.6.44.5, the consideration received by the
Company for any issue or sale of securities shall:

(A) to the extent it consists of cash, be computed as the aggregate amount of cash received by
the Company;

(B) to the extent it consists of property other than cash, be computed at the fair value of that
property as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company; and

(C) if Additional Shares of Common or Convertible Securities are issued or sold together with
other stock or securities or other assets of the Company for a consideration that covers both, be
computed as the portion of the consideration so received that may be reasonably determined in
good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company to be allocable to such Additional Shares
of Common or Convertible Securities.

4.3.4.4.7 Liquidating Dividends. Subject to the preferential rights of holders of Series B Preferred
pursuant to the provisions of Section 4.4.4.4.7, holders of Series B-1 Preferred pursuant to the
provisions of Section 4.5.4.4.7 and holders of Series C Preferred pursuant to the provisions of
Section 4.6.4.4.7, if the Company, at any time while any of the Series A Preferred is outstanding,
shall make a distribution of its assets to the holders of its Common as a dividend in liquidation or
partial liquidation or by way of return of capital or other than as a dividend payable out of funds
legally available for dividends under the laws of the State of Delaware, the holders of the Series A
Preferred shall be entitled to receive, without payment of any consideration therefor, the assets that
would have been payable to them as owners of that number of shares of Common receivable by
exercise of such Series A Conversion Rights, had they been the holders of record of such Common
on the record date for such distribution; and an appropriate provision therefor shall be made a part of
any such distribution in accordance with the preferential provisions of Section 4.3.3 of this Restated
Certificate.

4.3.4.5 Reservation of Shares. The Company will take such corporate action as may be necessary from time
to time so that at all times it will have authorized, and reserved out of its authorized but unissued Common
for the sole purpose of issuance upon conversion of shares of Series A Preferred, a sufficient number of
shares of Common to permit the conversion in full of all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred.

4.3.4.6 Full Consideration. All shares of Common which shall be issued upon the conversion of any Series A
Preferred will, upon issuance, be fully paid and non- assessable. The Company will pay such amounts and
will take such other action as may be necessary from time to time so that all shares of Common which shall
be issued upon the exercise of the Series A Conversion Right of any Series A Preferred will, upon issuance
and without cost to the recipient, be free from all preemptive rights, taxes, liens and charges with respect to
the issue thereof.

4.3.4.7 Notice of Adjustment Events. Whenever the Company contemplates the occurrence of an event
which would give rise to adjustments under Section 4.3.4.4, the Company shall mail to each holder of Series
A Preferred, at least 20 days prior to the record date with respect to such event or, if no record date shall be
established, at least 20 days prior to such event, a notice specifying (i) the nature of the contemplated event,
and (ii) the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such event, and (iii) the date on
which such event is expected to become effective, and (iv) the time, if any is to be fixed, when the holders of
record of Common (or other securities) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common (or other
securities) for securities or other property deliverable in connection with such event.

-15-

4.3.4.8 Notice of Adjustments. Whenever the Series A Conversion Price or the kind of securities issuable
upon the conversion of Series A Preferred, or both, shall be adjusted pursuant to Section 4.3.44, the
Company shall mail to each holder of Series A Preferred, by first class mail postage prepaid, promptly after
each adjustment, a certificate signed by its President or a Vice President and by its Chief Financial Officer,
Secretary or Assistant Secretary, setting forth, in reasonable detail, the event requiring the adjustment, the
amount of the adjustment, the method by which such adjustment was calculated (including a description of
the basis on which the Board of Directors of the Company made any determination hereunder), and the
Series A Conversion Price and the kind of securities issuable upon the conversion of Series A Preferred after
giving effect to such adjustment.

4.3.5 Redemption.

4.3.5.1 For purposes of this Restated Certificate, the “Redemption Trigger Date” means the fifth
anniversary of the Initial Closing.

4.3.5.2 No share of Series A Preferred shall be redeemed under the provisions of this Section 4.3.5 if there
are shares of Series B Preferred, Series B-1 Preferred or Series C Preferred outstanding at such time unless
funds required to satisfy the Series B Redemption Price, Series B-1 Redemption Price and Series C
Redemption Price of all such shares of Series B Preferred, Series B-1 Preferred and Series C Preferred have
been set apart by the Company for payment as described in Sections 4.4.5.6, 4.5.5.6 and 4.6.5.5.

4.3.5.3 Subject to the limitation set forth in Section 4.3.5.2, at any time on or after the Redemption Trigger
Date, the holders of at least 60% of the outstanding Series A Preferred shall have the right to elect to require
the Company to redeem all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred. Within not more than fifteen (15)
business days after receipt of written notice of such election (“Series A Redemption Election”), the
Company will provide a written notice (“Series A Redemption Notice”) advising each holder of Series A
Preferred of the proposed redemption in the form required under Section 4.3.5.3.1. The Board of Directors
shall establish the date on which the Series A Preferred will be redeemed (“Series A Redemption Date’),
which date will be not less than thirty (30) nor more than ninety (90) days after the date the Company
receives the Series A Redemption Election. On the Series A Redemption Date, the Company will redeem for
cash, out of funds legally available for such purpose, all shares of Series A Preferred at a price per share
equal to the Series A Original Purchase Price (such amount to be adjusted proportionately in the event the
shares of Series A Preferred are subdivided into a greater number or combined into a lesser number) plus all
declared but unpaid dividends on such shares (the “Series A Redemption Price”).
-16-

4.3.5.3.1 The Series A Redemption Notice shall state:

(a) that the holders of at least 60% of the outstanding Series A Preferred have elected to require the
Company to redeem all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred,

(b) the amount of funds legally available for such redemption and the maximum number of shares of
Series A Preferred the Company can redeem,

(c) the Series A Redemption Date, and

(d) _ that each holder is to surrender to the Company in the manner designated at the Company’s
principal place of business, its certificate or certificates representing the shares of Series A
Preferred to be redeemed.

4.3.5.4 Each holder of shares of Series A Preferred being redeemed shall surrender the certificate or
certificates representing such shares to the Company, at the Company’s principal place of business. Upon
such surrender (but not earlier than the Series A Redemption Date) the Series A Redemption Price for such
shares shall be payable to the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as
the owner thereof, and each surrendered certificate shall be cancelled

and retired. If a certificate is surrendered and all the shares evidenced thereby cannot be redeemed, the
Company shall cause certificates evidencing the shares not being redeemed to be issued in the name of the
registered owner of such shares and to be delivered to such person.

4.3.5.5 If the Series A Redemption Price is either paid or made available for payment through the deposit
arrangement specified in Section 4.3.5.6 with respect to any shares of Series A Preferred, then
notwithstanding that the certificates evidencing any of the shares to be redeemed shall not have been
surrendered, all rights with respect to such shares shall terminate as of the Series A Redemption Date, except
only the right of the holder to receive the Series A Redemption Price upon surrender of the certificate
evidencing such shares.

4.3.5.6 Subject to Section 4.3.5.2, within 10 business days of the Company’s receipt of the Series A
Redemption Election, the Company shall deposit with any bank or trust company having a capital and
surplus of at least $50,000,000 as a trust fund, a sum equal to the aggregate Series A Redemption Price of all
outstanding shares of Series A Preferred with irrevocable instructions and authority to the bank or trust
company to pay, on or after the Series A Redemption Date, the Series A Redemption Price to the respective
holders of Series A Preferred upon the surrender of their share certificates. From and after the date of such
deposit, the shares so called for redemption shall be redeemed. The deposit shall constitute full payment of
the shares to their holders, and from and after the Series A Redemption Date, the shares shall be deemed to
be no longer outstanding, and the holders thereof shall cease to be shareholders with respect thereto and shall
have no rights with respect thereto except the rights to receive from the bank or trust company payment of
the Series A Redemption Price of the shares, without interest, upon surrender of their certificates therefor
(and a certificate for those shares, if any, evidenced by such certificates which are not being redeemed on
such Series A Redemption Date). Any funds so deposited and unclaimed at the end of one year from such
Series A Redemption Date shall be released or repaid to the Company, after which the former holders of the
shares called for redemption shall be entitled to receive payment of the Series A Redemption Price with
respect to such shares only from the Company.

-17-

4.3.5.7 Subject to Section 4.3.5.2 hereof, if the funds of the Company legally available therefor shall be
insufficient to discharge the Series A Preferred redemption requirement in full, funds to the extent legally
available for such purpose shall be set aside upon the Company’s receipt of a Series A Redemption Election
in accordance with Section 4.3.5.6. The maximum number of full shares of Series A Preferred that can be
redeemed with such funds shall be redeemed from the holders of shares of Series A Preferred as of the date
of such Series A Redemption Election ratably in accordance with the full amounts otherwise payable to
them. Thereafter, the Company shall redeem shares of Series A Preferred ratably from the holders thereof as
funds legally available therefor become available.
4.3.5.8 Nothing in this Section 4.3.5 shall prevent any holder of shares of Series A Preferred from exercising
the Series A Conversion Right of such shares at any time prior to the actual redemption of such shares.
4.3.6 No Reissuance of Series A Preferred. No share or shares of Series A Preferred acquired by the Company by
reason of redemption, purchase, conversion or otherwise shall be reissued, and all such shares shall be
canceled, retired and eliminated from the shares which the Company shall be authorized to issue.

4.4 Powers and Qualifications of Series B Preferred Stock. The powers, preferences and rights, and the

qualifications, restrictions or limitations, of the Series B Preferred are as follows:

44.1 Voting Rights. Except as otherwise required by law or expressly provided in this Restated Certificate, each
share of Series B Preferred (including any fractional share) shall entitle the holder thereof to vote on each
matter submitted to a vote of the shareholders of the Company and to have the number of votes equal to the
number (including any fraction) of shares of Common into which such share of Series B Preferred is then
convertible pursuant to the provisions hereof at the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to
vote on such matter or, if no such record date is established, at the date such vote is taken or any written
consent of shareholders becomes effective. Except as otherwise required by law or expressly provided in this
Restated Certificate, the holders of shares of Common and Preferred of all classes shall vote together and not
as separate classes or series.

4.4.2 Dividends.

4.4.2.1 Subject to the rights of holders of Series C Preferred pursuant to the provisions of Section 4.6.2, the
holders of the Series B Preferred shall be entitled to receive dividends at the rate of 8% of the Series B
Original Purchase Price (as hereafter defined) (such amount to be adjusted proportionately in the event the
shares of Series B Preferred are subdivided into a greater number or combined into a lesser number) per
annum, payable out of funds legally available therefor. Such dividends shall be (i) payable only when, as and
if declared by the Board of Directors, (ii) non-cumulative and (iii) pari passu with dividends payable to the
holders of the Series B-1 Preferred pursuant to Section 4.5.2.1. The “Series B Original Purchase Price”
shall be $1.76.

-18-

4.4.2.2 No dividends (other than those payable on Common solely in shares of Common) shall be paid on
any shares of Series A Preferred or Common during any fiscal year of the Company until dividends in the
total amount determined in accordance with Section 4.4.2.1 (adjusted in accordance therewith, if applicable)
on the Series B Preferred shall have been paid or declared and set apart during that fiscal year, and no
dividends (other than those payable on Common solely in shares of Common) shall be paid on any share of
Series B-1 Preferred, Series A Preferred or Common, unless a dividend is paid with respect to all
outstanding shares of Series B Preferred in an amount for each such share of Series B Preferred equal to or
greater than the aggregate amount of such dividends for all shares of Common into which each such share of
Series B Preferred could then be converted (assuming, for the purposes of calculating the amount of
dividends to be paid under this section, in the case of dividends declared on shares of Series B-1 Preferred or
Series A Preferred, that such shares of Series B-1 Preferred or Series A Preferred, as applicable, had been
converted into shares of Common and such dividends had been declared on the shares of Common issued
upon conversion thereof).

4.4.2.3 In the event any dividend or other distribution payable in cash or other property (other than securities
of the Company the issuance of which gives rise to adjustments pursuant to Section 4.4.4.4 of this Restated
Certificate) is declared on any Common, each holder of shares of Series B Preferred on the record date for
such dividend or distribution shall be entitled to receive, pari passu with the dividends payable to the holders
of Series B-1 Preferred pursuant to Section 4.5.2.3, in addition to any dividend under 4.4.2.1, on the date of
payment or distribution of such dividend or other distribution the same cash or other property which such
holder would have received on such record date if such holder were the holder of record of the number
(including any fraction) of shares of Common into which the shares of Series B Preferred then held by such
holder are then convertible.

4.4.2.4 In the event a holder of Series B Preferred (i) executes the Series C Purchase Agreement and
commits to purchase thereunder an amount of Series C Preferred having an aggregate purchase price at least
equal to such holder’s Pro Rata Share as set forth opposite such holder’s name on Exhibit A-3 to the Series C
Purchase Agreement, and (ii) at the Initial Closing purchases the amount of Series C Preferred allocated to
such holder as set forth opposite such holder’s name under the heading “Cash Initial Shares” on Exhibit A-1
to the Series C Purchase Agreement, then at the Initial Closing such holder shall be issued a number of
additional shares of Series B Preferred equal to the greatest whole number obtained by dividing the
aggregate amount of the dividends that have accrued on such holder’s shares of Series B Preferred through
January 31, 2008 under the Old Restated Certificate but have not been paid, whether or not declared, by the
Series B Original Purchase Price. All other dividends that have accrued on such holder’s shares of Series B
Preferred through the Effective Time under the Old Restated Certificate but have not been paid shall be
cancelled. In determining whether any holder of Series B Preferred has satisfied the criteria set forth in
clause (i) of this Section 4.4.2.4, any purchases of Series C Preferred under the Series C Purchase Agreement
by a Related Party of such holder that are in excess of the Pro Rata Share of such Related Party shall, to the
extent requested by such holder, be attributed to such holder; provided that no shares constituting part of
such excess shall be attributed to more than one holder of Preferred.

-19-

4.4.3 Liquidation Rights.

4.4.3.1 Subject to the rights of holders of Series C Preferred pursuant to the provisions of Section 4.6.3, if
the Company shall be voluntarily or involuntarily liquidated, dissolved or wound up, the holder of each share
of Series B Preferred then outstanding (including any fractional shares) shall be entitled to receive out of the
assets of the Company available for distribution to shareholders, pari passu with the distribution payable to
the holders of Series B-1 Preferred pursuant to Section 4.5.3.1, and before any payment or declaration and
setting apart for payment of any amount shall be made with respect to the Series A Preferred or Common, an
amount equal to (i) 100% of the Series B Original Purchase Price (such amount to be adjusted
proportionately in the event the shares of Series B Preferred are subdivided into a greater number or
combined into a lesser number), plus (ii) an amount equal to any dividends on such share which are declared
but unpaid as of such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company.

4.4.3.2 If, upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or
involuntary, and subject to payment to holders of Series C Preferred of the full preferential amount pursuant
to Section 4.6.3.1, the assets to be distributed to the holders of Series B Preferred and the holders of Series
B-1 Preferred shall be insufficient to permit the payment of the full preferential amount pursuant to Sections
44.3.1 and 4.5.3.1 of this Restated Certificate, then all of the then-remaining assets of the Company to be
distributed shall be distributed ratably to the holders of Series B Preferred and Series B-1 Preferred, based
upon the amounts which would otherwise payable to such holders pursuant to Section 4.4.3.1 or 4.5.3.1, as
the case may be.

4.4.3.3 Upon the dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary,
the assets of the Company available for distribution to shareholders after and in addition to the distribution
of the preferential amounts pursuant to Sections 4.6.3.1, 4.5.3.1,4.4.3.1 and 4.3.3.1 of this Restated

Certificate, shall be distributed ratably to all holders of Common and Preferred on an “‘as-converted basis”.

4.4.3 4 For purposes of this Restated Certificate, including without limitation Sections 4.6.3, 4.5.3, 4.4.3 and
4.3.3, unless waived by the holders of at least 60% of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred, each of
the following events shall be treated as a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company and shall
entitle the holders of shares of all series of Preferred and Common to receive at the closing in cash, securities
or other property (valued as provided in Sections 4.3.3.5, 4.4.3.5, 4.5.3.5 and 4.6.3.5) the amounts specified
in Sections 4.3.3.1 through 4.3.3.5, 4.4.3.1 through 4.4.3.5, 4.5.3.1 through 4.5.3.5 and 4.6.3.1 through
4.6.3.5: (i) any acquisition of the Company by means of merger or other form of corporate reorganization in
which outstanding shares of the Company are exchanged for securities or other consideration issued, or
caused to be issued, by the acquiring corporation or its subsidiary (other than a transaction resulting in
ownership of more than 50% of the equity of the acquiring corporation by shareholders of the Company) or
(ii) a sale of the voting control of the Company or (iii) a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company. The sale of shares of Series C Preferred pursuant to the Series C Purchase Agreement shall not be
treated as a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company.

- 20 -

4.4.3.5 Whenever the distribution provided for in this Section 4.4.3 shall be payable in securities or property
other than cash, the value of such distribution shall be the fair market value of such securities or other
property as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.
44.4 Conversion.

444.1

(a)

Terms of Conversion.

4.44.1.1 Optional Conversion. The holder of each share of Series B Preferred shall have the right
(the “Series B Conversion Right”), at such holder’s option, to convert such share at any time,
without cost and otherwise on the terms of this Section 4.4.4, into the number of fully paid and non-
assessable shares of Common that results from dividing:

(A) $1.76,
by:
(B) the Series B Conversion Price in effect at the time of conversion.

The “Series B Conversion Price” shall initially be $1.00 and shall be subject to adjustment
from time to time as provided in this Section 4.4.4.

4.44.1.2 Mandatory Conversion. All of the outstanding Series B Preferred shall, without any further
action by a holder thereof, convert into Common (a “Series B Mandatory Conversion”) upon the
first to occur of the following (each a “Series B Mandatory Conversion Event”): (A) the
Company’s Qualified Public Offering, (B) at such time as at least two-thirds of the aggregate number
of shares of Series B Preferred and Series B-1 Preferred, collectively, issued prior to such time have
been voluntarily converted into Common by the holders thereof, (C) at such time as is specified in a
vote or written consent of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Series B
Preferred and Series B-1 Preferred, voting together as a single class on an as-converted basis, or (D)
at such time as is specified in a vote or written consent of the holders of at least 60% of the
outstanding shares of Series C Preferred with respect to the conversion of all Preferred into Common.
In each case each share of Series B Preferred shall be automatically converted, without cost, on the
terms of this Section 4.4.4, into the number of shares of Common into which such share of Series B
Preferred would be convertible under Section 4.4.4.1.1 immediately prior to such conversion.

-21-

44.4.1.3 Pay to Play Conversion.
Concurrently with the Initial Closing, each share of Series B Preferred outstanding at the time of
the Initial Closing shall automatically convert into 0.01 share of Common except as expressly
provided under this paragraph (a). Each share of Series B Preferred issued after the Initial Closing
upon the exercise of a warrant outstanding at the time of the Initial Closing shall immediately
upon issuance convert into 0.01 share of Common except as expressly provided under this
paragraph (a). The foregoing conversion to Common shall not occur with respect to any share of
Series B Preferred if the holder of such share of Series B Preferred or warrant to purchase Series
B Preferred (i) executes the Series C Purchase Agreement and commits to purchase thereunder an
amount of Series C Preferred having an aggregate purchase price at least equal to such holder’s
Pro Rata Share as set forth opposite such holder’s name on Exhibit A-3 to the Series C Purchase
Agreement, and (ii) at the Initial Closing purchases the amount of Series C Preferred allocated to
such holder as set forth opposite such holder’s name under the heading “Cash Initial Shares” on
Exhibit A-1 to the Series C Purchase Agreement Following the conversion of such shares of
Series B Preferred, the holder thereof shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor at the
office of the Company or any transfer agent for the Series B Preferred. Upon such surrender, the
Company shall issue and deliver to such holder, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a
certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common to which such holder is entitled. If
a holder’s shares of Series B Preferred are converted pursuant to this Section 4.4.4.1.3(a), then
notwithstanding that the certificates evidencing such shares shall not have been surrendered, all
rights with respect to such shares shall terminate at the Initial Closing, except only the right of the
holder to receive certificates evidencing the shares of Common upon surrender of the certificate
evidencing such converted shares of Series B Preferred. Any dividends or distributions accrued
but unpaid at the time of conversion with respect to a share of Series B Preferred so converted
pursuant to this Section 4.4.4.1.3(a), whether declared or not, shall be cancelled. In determining
whether any holder of Series B Preferred has satisfied the criteria set forth in clause (i) of this
Section 4.4.4.1.3(a), any purchases of Series C Preferred under the Series C Purchase Agreement
by a Related Party of such holder that are in excess of the Pro Rata Share of such Related Party
shall, to the extent requested by such holder, be attributed to such holder; provided that no shares
constituting part of such excess shall be attributed to more than one holder of Preferred.

(b) —_ If the Milestone Closing occurs and a holder of Series B Preferred does not purchase the number
of Milestone Shares allocated to such holder under the Series C Purchase Agreement, then
concurrently with the Milestone Closing, (i) each share of Series B Preferred issued to such
holder pursuant to Section 4.4.2.4 shall automatically be redeemed pursuant to the terms of
Section 4.5 of the Series C Purchase Agreement and (ii) each other share of Series B Preferred
held by such holder, or held by such holder at the time of the Initial Closing and subsequently
transferred, shall automatically convert into 0.01 share of Common. Promptly following the
Milestone Closing, the holder of shares so redeemed or converted shall surrender the certificates
therefor at the office of the Company or any transfer agent for the Series B Preferred. In the case
of converted shares, upon such surrender the Company shall issue and deliver to such holder, or
to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of
Common to which such holder is entitled. If a holder’s shares of Series B Preferred are redeemed
or converted pursuant to this Section 4.4.4.1.3(b), then notwithstanding that the certificates
evidencing such shares shall not have been surrendered, all rights with respect to such shares shall
terminate at the Milestone Closing, except only the right of the holder upon surrender of the
certificates evidencing such converted shares to receive certificates evidencing the shares of
Common issued upon such conversion. In determining whether any holder of Series B Preferred
has purchased the number of Milestone Shares allocated to such holder under the Series C
Purchase Agreement, any purchases of Milestone Shares under the Series C Purchase Agreement
by a Related Party of such holder that are in excess of the Milestone Shares allocated to such
Related Party under the Series C Purchase Agreement shall, to the. extent requested by such
holder, be attributed to such holder; provided that no shares constituting part of such excess shall
be attributed to more than one holder of Preferred.

(c) All shares of Common issued to any holder of Series B Preferred as a result of conversion
pursuant to this Section 4.4.4.1.3 shall be aggregated for the purpose of determining the number
of shares of Common to which such holder shall be entitled, and no fractional shares shall be
issued in connection with such conversion. Any stockholder who would otherwise be entitled to
receive a fractional share of Common as a result of such conversion shall receive in lieu thereof
cash in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the Series C Original Purchase Price (as
defined below).

4.4.4.2 Mechanics of Conversion.

4.4.4.2.1 Optional Conversion. A holder of any share of Series B Preferred may exercise the Series B
Conversion Right of such share by surrendering the certificate therefor, duly endorsed, at the office
of the Company or of any transfer agent for the Series B Preferred, together with a written notice to
the Company which states:

(A) that such holder elects to convert the same,

(B) the number of shares of Series B Preferred being converted, and
-23-

(C) the name or names in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of
Common to be issued.

Thereupon the Company shall promptly issue and deliver to the holder of such shares, or to the
nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of
Common to which such holder shall be entitled. If the certificate evidencing the shares of Series
B Preferred being converted shall also evidence shares of Series B Preferred not being
converted, then the Company shall also deliver to the holder of such certificate, or to the
nominee or nominees of such holder, a new stock certificate evidencing the Series B Preferred
not converted. Any dividends or distributions declared but unpaid at the time of conversion with
respect to a share of Series B Preferred so converted shall be payable ratably to the holders of
the Common issued upon such conversion, pari passu with the payment of such dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to Section 4.5.4.2.1.

4.4.4.2.2 Mandatory Conversion. The Company shall give written notice to each holder of a share of
Series B Preferred (A) not more than forty (40) nor less than twenty (20) days before the anticipated
effective date of the registration statement with respect to any Qualified Public Offering, and shall
also give written notice to each such holder upon the occurrence of any Qualified Public Offering;
and (B) upon the occurrence of any other Series B Mandatory Conversion Event. Following the
conversion of such shares, each holder of shares so converted may surrender the certificate therefor
at the office of the Company or any transfer agent for the Series B Preferred. Upon such surrender,
the Company shall issue and deliver to each holder, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a
certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common to which such holder is entitled. Any
dividends or distributions declared but unpaid at the time of conversion with respect to a share of
Series B Preferred so converted shall be payable ratably to the holders of the Common issued upon
such conversion, pari passu with the payment of such dividends or distributions payable pursuant to
Section 4.5.4.2.2.

4.4.4.3 Effective Date of Conversion.

4.4.4.3.1 Optional Conversion. The conversion of any shares of Series B Preferred shall be deemed
to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date that the shares to be
converted are surrendered to the Company together with the notice required by Section 4.4.4.2.1, and
the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common issuable upon such conversion shall
be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common on such date.

4.4.4.3.2 Mandatory Conversion. The conversion of shares of Series B Preferred shall take place
upon the first to occur of the Series B Mandatory Conversion Events, whether or not the certificates
representing such shares of Series B Preferred shall have been surrendered, or new certificates
representing the shares of Common into which such shares have been converted shall have been
issued.

-24-

44.44 Adjustment of Conversion Price.

4.44.4.1 Subdivision or Combination of Shares. If the Company at any time subdivides or combines
the outstanding Common after the Filing Date, the Series B Conversion Price shall be decreased, in
the case of a subdivision, or increased, in the case of a combination, in the same proportions as the
Common is subdivided or combined, effective automatically as of the date the Company shall take a
record of the holders of its Common for the purpose of the subdivision or combination (or if no such
record is taken, as of the effectiveness of the subdivision or combination).

4.44.4.2 Stock Dividends. If the Company at any time pays a dividend, or makes any other
distribution, to holders of Common payable in shares of Common, or fixes a record date for the
determination of holders of Common entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in
shares of Common, the Series B Conversion Price shall be decreased by multiplying it by a fraction:

(A) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common outstanding,
immediately prior to such dividend or distribution, and

(B) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common outstanding
immediately after such dividend or distribution (plus, if the Company paid cash instead of
fractional shares otherwise issuable in such dividend or distribution, the number of additional
shares which would have been outstanding had the Company issued fractional shares instead of
cash),

effective automatically as of the date the Company shall take a record of the holders of its
Common for the purpose of receiving such dividend or distribution (or if no such record is
taken, as of the effectiveness of such dividend or distribution).

4444.3 Reclassification, Consolidation or Merger. If at any time, as a result of:
(A) a capital reorganization or reclassification (other than a subdivision, combination or
dividend which gives rise to adjustment of the Series B Conversion Price pursuant to Sections
4444.1 or 4444.2), or

(B) a merger or consolidation of the Company with another corporation (whether or not the
Company is the surviving corporation),
-25-

the Common issuable upon the conversion of the Series B Preferred shall be changed into or
exchanged for the same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock of the
Company or any other corporation, or other securities convertible into such shares, then, as a
part of such reorganization, reclassification, merger or consolidation, appropriate adjustments
shall be made in the terms of the Series B Preferred (or of any securities into which the Series B
Preferred is changed or for which the Series B Preferred is exchanged), so that:

(X) the holders of Series B Preferred or of such substitute securities shall thereafter be entitled to
receive, upon conversion of the Series B Preferred or of such substitute securities, the kind and
amount of shares of stock, other securities, money and property which such holders would have
received at the time of such capital reorganization, reclassification, merger, or consolidation, if
such holders had converted their Series B Preferred into Common immediately prior to such
capital reorganization, reclassification, merger, or consolidation, and

(Y) the Series B Preferred or such substitute securities shall thereafter be adjusted on terms as
nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments theretofore provided in Section
444A.

The provisions of this Section 4.4.4.4.3 shall similarly apply to successive capital
reorganizations, reclassifications, mergers, and consolidations.

4444.4 Additional Shares of Common. If at any time the Company issues (or is deemed by the
express provisions of Section 4.3.4.4.5 to have issued or sold) Additional Shares of Common without
consideration or for a consideration per share less than the lower of (i) the Series B Conversion Price
in effect at such issuance or (ii) the Series C Conversion Price in effect at such issuance, then the
Series B Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issuance, to a price (calculated to
the nearest cent) equal to the price determined by multiplying the Series B Conversion Price by a
fraction:

(A) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Outstanding immediately
prior to the issuance of such Additional Shares of Common plus the number of shares of
Common which the aggregate consideration received (or by the express provisions hereof
deemed to have been received) by the Company for the total number of such Additional Shares
of Common so issued would purchase at the Series B Conversion Price, and

(B) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Outstanding
immediately after the issuance of such Additional Shares of Common;

provided, however, that in no event shall the Series B Conversion Price be reduced below $.01.
- 26 -

4444.5 Convertible Securities. For purposes of the adjustment required under Section 4.4.4.4.4,
Convertible Securities shall be treated as described in Section 4.3.4.4:5.

4444.6 Valuation of Consideration. The value of consideration received by the Company for any
issue or sale of securities shall be determined as set forth in Section 4.3.4.4.6.

4444.7 Liquidating Dividends. Subject to the preferential rights of holders of Series C Preferred
pursuant to the provisions of Section 4.6.4.4.7, if the Company, at any time while any of the Series B
Preferred is outstanding, shall make a distribution of its assets to the holders of its Common as a
dividend in liquidation or partial liquidation or by way of return of capital or other than as a dividend
payable out of funds legally available for dividends under the laws of the State of Delaware, the
holders of the Series B Preferred shall be entitled to receive, without payment of any consideration
therefor, the assets that would have been payable to them as owners of that number of shares of
Common receivable by exercise of such Series B Conversion Rights, had they been the holders of
record of such Common on the record date for such distribution; and an appropriate provision
therefor shall be made a part of any such distribution in accordance with the preferential provisions
of Section 4.4.3 of this Restated Certificate.

4.4.45 Reservation of Shares. The Company will take such corporate action as may be necessary from time
to time so that at all times it will have authorized, and reserved out of its authorized but unissued Common
for the sole purpose of issuance upon conversion of shares of Series B Preferred, a sufficient number of
shares of Common to permit the conversion in full of all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred.

4.4.4.6 Full Consideration. All shares of Common which shall be issued upon the conversion of any Series B
Preferred will, upon issuance, be fully paid and non- assessable. The Company will pay such amounts and
will take such other action as may be necessary from time to time so that all shares of Common which shall
be issued upon the exercise of the Series B Conversion Right of any Series B Preferred will, upon issuance
and without cost to the recipient, be free from all preemptive rights, taxes, liens and charges with respect to
the issue thereof.

44.4.7 Notice of Adjustment Events. Whenever the Company contemplates the occurrence of an event
which would give rise to adjustments under Section 4.4.4.4, the Company shall mail to each holder of Series
B Preferred, at least 20 days prior to the record date with respect to such event or, if no record date shall be
established, at least 20 days prior to such event, a notice specifying (i) the nature of the contemplated event,
and (ii) the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such event, and (iii) the date on
which such event is expected to become effective, and (iv) the time, if any is to be fixed, when the holders of
record of Common (or other securities) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common (or other
securities) for securities or other property deliverable in connection with such event.

-27-

4.4.4.8 Notice of Adjustments. Whenever the Series B Conversion Price or the kind of securities issuable
upon the conversion of Series B Preferred, or both, shall be adjusted pursuant to Section 4.4.4.4, the
Company shall mail to each holder of Series B Preferred, by first class mail postage prepaid, promptly after
each adjustment, a certificate signed by its President or a Vice President and by its Chief Financial Officer,
Secretary or Assistant Secretary, setting forth, in reasonable detail, the event requiring the adjustment, the
amount of the adjustment, the method by which such adjustment was calculated (including a description of
the basis on which the Board of Directors of the Company made any determination hereunder), and the
Series B Conversion Price and the kind of securities issuable upon the conversion of Series B Preferred after
giving effect to such adjustment.

4.4.5 Redemption.

4.4.5.1 “Redemption Trigger Date” has the meaning ascribed thereto in Section 4.3.5.1 above.

4.4.5.2 No share of Series B Preferred or Series B-1 Preferred shall be redeemed under the provisions of this
Section 4.4.5 or of Section 4.5.5 if there are shares of Series C Preferred outstanding at such time unless
funds required to satisfy the Series C Redemption Price of all such shares of Series C Preferred have been set
apart by the Company for payment as described in Sections 4.6.5.5.

4.4.5.3 Subject to the limitation set forth in Section 4.4.5.2, at any time on or after the Redemption Trigger
Date, the holders of at least 60% of the outstanding Series B Preferred and Series B-1 Preferred, voting
together as a single class on an as- converted basis, shall have the right to elect to require the Company to
redeem all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred and Series B-1 Preferred. Within not more than fifteen
(15) business days after receipt of written notice of such election (“Series B/B-1 Redemption Election”),
the Company will provide a written notice (“Series B/B-1 Redemption Notice”) advising each holder of
Series B Preferred and/or Series B-1 Preferred of the proposed redemption in the form required under
Section 4.4.5.3.1. The Board of Directors shall establish the date on which the Series B Preferred and Series
B-1 Preferred will be redeemed (“Series B/B-1 Redemption Date”), which date will be not less than thirty
(30) nor more than ninety (90) days after the date the Company receives the Series B/B-1 Redemption
Election. On the Series B/B-1 Redemption Date, the Company will redeem for cash, out of funds legally
available for such purpose, all shares of Series B Preferred at a price per share equal to the Series B Original
Purchase Price (such amount to be adjusted proportionately in the event the shares of Series B Preferred are
subdivided into a greater number or combined into a lesser number) plus all declared but unpaid dividends
on such shares (the “Series B Redemption Price”) and all shares of Series B-1 Preferred at a price per share
equal to the Series B-1 Original Purchase Price (such amount to be adjusted proportionately in the event the
shares of Series B-1 Preferred are subdivided into a greater number or combined into a lesser number) plus
all declared but unpaid dividends on such shares (the “Series B-1 Redemption Price’)

- 28 -

4.4.5.3.1 The Series B/B-1 Redemption Notice shall state:

(a) that the holders of at least 60% of the outstanding Series B Preferred and Series B-1 Preferred,
voting together as a single class on an as- converted basis, have elected to require the Company to
redeem all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred and Series B-1 Preferred,

(b) the amount of funds legally available for such redemption and the maximum number of shares of
Series B Preferred and Series B-1 Preferred the Company can redeem,

(c) the Series B/B-1 Redemption Date, and

(d) that each holder is to surrender to the Company in the manner designated at the Company’s
principal place of business, its certificate or certificates representing the shares of Series B
Preferred and Series B-1 Preferred to be redeemed.

4.4.5 4 Each holder of shares of Series B Preferred and Series B-1 Preferred being redeemed shall surrender
the certificate or certificates representing such shares to the Company, at the Company’s principal place of
business. Upon such surrender (but not earlier than the Series B/B-1 Redemption Date) the Series B
Redemption Price for such shares of Series B Preferred and the Series B-1 Redemption Price for such shares
of Series B-1 Preferred shall be payable to the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or
certificates as the owner thereof, and each surrendered certificate shall be cancelled and retired. If a
certificate is surrendered and all the shares evidenced thereby cannot be redeemed, the Company shall cause
certificates evidencing the shares not being redeemed to be issued in the name of the registered owner of
such shares and to be delivered to such person.

4.4.5.5 If the Series B Redemption Price and Series B-1 Redemption Price is either paid or made available
for payment through the deposit arrangement specified in Section 4.4.5.6 with respect to any shares of Series
B Preferred and Series B-1 Preferred, then notwithstanding that the certificates evidencing any of the shares
to be redeemed shall not have been surrendered, all rights with respect to such shares shall terminate as of
the Series B/B-1 Redemption Date, except only the right of the holder to receive the Series B Redemption
Price or Series B-1 Redemption Price, as the case may be, upon surrender of the certificate evidencing such
shares.

4.4.5.6 Subject to Section 4.4.5.2, within 10 business days of the Company’s receipt of the Series B/B-1
Redemption Election, the Company shall deposit with any bank or trust company having a capital and
surplus of at least $50,000,000 as a trust fund, a sum equal to the aggregate Series B Redemption Price of all
outstanding shares of Series B Preferred plus the aggregate Series B-1 Redemption Price of all outstanding
shares of Series B-1 Preferred with irrevocable instructions and authority to the bank or trust company to
pay, on or after the Series B/B-1 Redemption Date, the Series B Redemption Price to the respective holders
of Series B Preferred and the Series B-1 Redemption Price to the respective holders of Series B-1 Preferred
upon the surrender of their share certificates. From and after the date of such deposit, the shares so called for
redemption shall be redeemed. The deposit shall constitute full payment of the shares to their holders, and
from and after the Series B/B-1 Redemption Date, the shares shall be deemed to be no longer outstanding,
and the holders thereof shall cease to be shareholders with respect thereto and shall have no rights with
respect thereto except the rights to receive from the bank or trust company payment of the Series B
Redemption Price or Series B-1 Redemption Price of the shares, as the case may be, without interest, upon
surrender of their certificates therefor (and a certificate for those shares, if any, evidenced by such
certificates which are not being redeemed on such Series B/B-1 Redemption Date). Any funds so deposited
and unclaimed at the end of one year from such Series B/B-1 Redemption Date shall be released or repaid to
the Company, after which the former holders of the shares called for redemption shall be entitled to receive
payment of the Series B Redemption Price or Series B-1 Redemption Price with respect to such shares, as
the case may be, only from the Company.

-29 -
4.4.5.7 Subject to Section 4.4.5.2 hereof, if the funds of the Company legally available therefor shall be
insufficient to discharge the Series B Preferred and Series B-1 Preferred redemption requirements in full,
funds to the extent legally available for such purpose shall be set aside upon the Company’s receipt of a
Series B/B-1 Redemption Election in accordance with Sections 4.4.5.6. The maximum number of full shares
of Series B Preferred and Series B-1 Preferred that can be redeemed with such funds shall be redeemed from
the holders of shares of Series B-Preferred and Series B-1 Preferred as of the date of such Series B/B-1
Redemption Election ratably in accordance with the full amounts otherwise payable to them. Thereafter, the
Company shall redeem shares of Series B Preferred and Series B-1 Preferred ratably from the holders thereof
as funds legally available therefor become available.

4.4.5.8 Nothing in this Section 4.4.5 shall prevent any holder of shares of Series B Preferred or Series B-1
Preferred from exercising the Series B Conversion Right or Series B-1 Conversion right of such shares, as
the case may be, at any time prior to the actual redemption of such shares.
4.4.6 No Reissuance of Series B Preferred. No share or shares of Series B Preferred acquired by the Company by
reason of redemption, purchase, conversion or otherwise shall be reissued, and all such shares shall be
canceled, retired and eliminated from the shares which the Company shall be authorized to issue.

4.5 Powers and Qualifications of Series B-1 Preferred Stock. The powers, preferences and rights, and the

qualifications, restrictions or limitations, of the Series B-1 Preferred are as follows:

4.5.1 Voting Rights. Except as otherwise required by law or expressly provided in this Restated Certificate, each
share of Series B-1 Preferred (including any fractional share) shall entitle the holder thereof to vote on each
matter submitted to a vote of the shareholders of the Company and to have the number of votes equal to the
number (including any fraction) of shares of Common into which such share of Series B-1 Preferred is then
convertible pursuant to the provisions hereof at the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to
vote on such matter or, if no such record date is established, at the date such vote is taken or any written
consent of shareholders becomes effective. Except as otherwise required by law or expressly provided in this
Restated Certificate, the holders of shares of Common and Preferred of all classes shall vote together and not
as separate classes or series.

- 30 -

4.5.2 Dividends.

4.5.2.1 Subject to the rights of holders of Series C Preferred pursuant to the provisions of Section 4.6.2
hereof, the holders of the Series B-1 Preferred shall be entitled to receive dividends at the rate of 8% of the
Series B-1 Original Purchase Price (as hereafter defined) (such amount to be adjusted proportionately in the
event the shares of Series B-1 Preferred are subdivided into a greater number or combined into a lesser
number) per annum, payable out of funds legally available therefor. Such dividends shall be (i) payable only
when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors, (ii) non-cumulative and (iii) pari passu with dividends
payable to the holders of the Series B Preferred pursuant to Section 4.4.2.1. The “Series B-1 Original
Purchase Price” shall be $1.76.

4.5.2.2 No dividends (other than those payable on Common solely in shares of Common) shall be paid on
any shares of Series A Preferred or Common during any fiscal year of the Company until dividends in the
total amount determined in accordance with Section 4.5.2.1 (adjusted in accordance therewith, if applicable)
on the Series B-1 Preferred shall have been paid or declared and set apart during that fiscal year, and no
dividends (other than those payable on Common solely in shares of Common) shall be paid on any share of
Series B Preferred, Series A Preferred or Common, unless a dividend is paid with respect to all outstanding
shares of Series B-1 Preferred in an amount for each such share of Series B-1 Preferred equal to or greater
than the aggregate amount of such dividends for all shares of Common into which each such share of Series
B-1 Preferred could then be converted (assuming, for the purposes of calculating the amount of dividends to
be paid under this section, in the case of dividends declared on shares of Series B Preferred or Series A
Preferred, that such shares of Series B Preferred or Series A Preferred, as applicable, had been converted into
shares of Common and such dividends had been declared on the shares of Common issued upon conversion
thereof).

4.5.2.3 In the event any dividend or other distribution payable in cash or other property (other than securities
of the Company the issuance of which gives rise to adjustments pursuant to Section 4.5.4.4 of this Restated
Certificate) is declared on any Common, each holder of shares of Series B-1 Preferred on the record date for
such dividend or distribution shall be entitled to receive, pari passu with the dividends payable to the holders
of Series B Preferred pursuant to Section 4.4.2.3, in addition to any dividend under 4.5.2.1, on the date of
payment or distribution of such dividend or other distribution the same cash or other property which such
holder would have received on such record date if such holder were the holder of record of the number
(including any fraction) of shares of Common into which the shares of Series B-1 Preferred then held by
such holder are then convertible.

4.5.2.4 In the event a holder of Series B-1 Preferred (i) executes the Series C Purchase Agreement and
commits to purchase thereunder an amount of Series C Preferred having an aggregate purchase price at least
equal to such holder’s Pro Rata Share as set forth opposite such holder’s name on Exhibit A-3 to the Series C
Purchase Agreement, and (ii) at the Initial Closing purchases the amount of Series C Preferred allocated to
such holder as set forth opposite such holder’s name under the heading “Cash Initial Shares” on Exhibit A-1
to the Series C Purchase Agreement, then at the Initial Closing such holder shall be issued a number of
additional shares of Series B-1 Preferred equal to the greatest whole number obtained by dividing the
aggregate amount of the dividends that have accrued on such holder’s shares of Series B-1 Preferred through
January 31, 2008 under the Old Restated Certificate but have not been paid, whether or not declared, by the
Series B-1 Original Purchase Price. All other dividends that have accrued on such holder’s shares of Series
B-1 Preferred through the Effective Time under the Old Restated Certificate but have not been paid shall be
cancelled. In determining whether any holder of Series B-1 Preferred has satisfied the criteria set forth in
clause (i) of this Section 4.5.2.4, any purchases of Series C Preferred under the Series C Purchase Agreement
by a Related Party of such holder that are in excess of the Pro Rata Share of such Related Party shall, to the
extent requested by such holder, be attributed to such holder; provided that no shares constituting part of
such excess shall be attributed to more than one holder of Preferred.

4.5.3 Liquidation Rights.

4.5.3.1 Subject to the rights of holders of Series C Preferred pursuant to the provisions of Section 4.6.3, if
the Company shall be voluntarily or involuntarily liquidated, dissolved or wound up, the holder of each share
of Series B-1 Preferred then outstanding (including any fractional shares) shall be entitled to receive out of
the assets of the Company available for distribution to shareholders, pari passu with the distribution payable
to the holders of Series B Preferred pursuant to Section 4.4.3.1, and before any payment or declaration and
setting apart for payment of any amount shall be made with respect to the Series A Preferred or Common, an
amount equal to (i) 100% of the Series B-1 Original Purchase Price (such amount to be adjusted
proportionately in the event the shares of Series B-1 Preferred are subdivided into a greater number or
combined into a lesser number), plus (ii) an amount equal to any dividends on such share which are declared
but unpaid as of such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company.

4.5.3.2 If, upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or
involuntary, and subject to payment to holders of Series C Preferred of the full preferential amount pursuant
to Section 4.6.3.1, the assets to be distributed to the holders of Series B Preferred and the holders of Series
B-1 Preferred shall be insufficient to permit the payment of the full preferential amount pursuant to Sections
44.3.1 and 4.5.3.1 of this Restated Certificate, then all of the then-remaining assets of the Company to be
distributed shall be distributed ratably to the holders of Series B Preferred and Series B-1 Preferred, based
upon the amounts which would otherwise by payable to such holders pursuant to Section 4.4.3.1 or 4.5.3.1,
as the case may be.

4.5.3.3 Upon the dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary,
the assets of the Company available for distribution to shareholders after and in addition to the distribution
of the preferential amounts pursuant to Sections 4.6.3.1,4.5.3.1, 4.4.3.1 and 4.3.3.1 of this Restated

Certificate, shall be distributed ratably to all holders of Common and Preferred on an “as-converted basis”.

4.5.3.4 For purposes of this Restated Certificate, including without limitation Sections 4.6.3, 4.5.3, 4.4.3 and
4.3.3, unless waived by the holders of at least 60% of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred, each of
the following events shall be treated as a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company and shall
entitle the holders of shares of all series of Preferred and Common to receive at the closing in cash, securities
or other property (valued as provided in Sections 4.3.3.5, 4.4.3.5, 4.5.3.5 and 4.6.3.5) the amounts specified
in Sections 4.3.3.1 through 4.3.3.5, 4.4.3.1 through 4.4.3.5, 4.5.3.1 through 4.5.3.5 and 4.6.3.1 through
4.6.3.5: (i) any acquisition of the Company by means of merger or other form of corporate reorganization in
which outstanding shares of the Company are exchanged for securities or other consideration issued, or
caused to be issued, by the acquiring corporation or its subsidiary (other than a transaction resulting in
ownership of more than 50% of the equity of the acquiring corporation by shareholders of the Company) or
(ii) a sale of the voting control of the Company or (iii) a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company. The sale of shares of Series C Preferred pursuant to the Series C Purchase Agreement shall not be
treated as a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company.

-32-

4.5.3.5 Whenever the distribution provided for in this Section 4.5.3 shall be payable in securities or property
other than cash, the value of such distribution shall be the fair market value of such securities or other
property as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors

4.5.4 Conversion.

4.5.4.1 Terms of Conversion.

(a)

4.5.4.1.1 Optional Conversion. The holder of each share of Series B-1 Preferred shall have the right
(the “Series B-1 Conversion Right”), at such holder’s option, to convert such share at any time,
without cost and otherwise on the terms of this Section 4.5.4, into the number of fully paid and non-
assessable shares of Common that results from dividing:

(A) $1.76,
by:
(B) the Series B-1 Conversion Price in effect at the time of conversion.

The “Series B-1 Conversion Price” shall initially be $1.00 and shall be subject to adjustment
from time to time as provided in this Section 4.5 4.

4.5.4.1.2 Mandatory Conversion. All of the outstanding Series B-1 Preferred shall, without any
further action by a holder thereof, convert into Common (a “Series B-1 Mandatory Conversion”)
upon the first to occur of the following (each a “Series B-1 Mandatory Conversion Event”): (A)
the Company’s Qualified Public Offering, (B) at such time as at least two-thirds of the aggregate
number of shares of Series B Preferred and Series B-1 Preferred, collectively, issued prior to such
time have been voluntarily converted into Common by the holders thereof, (C) at such time as is
specified in a vote or written consent of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of
Series B Preferred and Series B-1 Preferred, voting together as a single class on an as-converted
basis, or (D) at such time as is specified in a vote or written consent of the holders of at least 60% of
the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred with respect to the conversion of all Preferred into
Common. In each case each share of Series B-1 Preferred shall be automatically converted, without
cost, on the terms of this Section 4.5.4, into the number of shares of Common into which such share
of Series B-1 Preferred would be convertible under Section 4.5.4.1.1 immediately prior to such
conversion.

- 33 -

4.5.4.1.3 Pay to Play Conversion.
Concurrently with the Initial Closing, each share of Series B-1 Preferred outstanding at the time
of the Initial Closing shall automatically convert into 0.01 share of Common except as expressly
provided under this paragraph (a). Each share of Series B-1 Preferred issued after the Initial
Closing upon the exercise of a warrant outstanding at the time of the Initial Closing shall
immediately upon issuance convert into 0.01 share of Common except as expressly provided
under this paragraph (a). The foregoing conversion to Common shall not occur with respect to
any share of Series B-1 Preferred if the holder of such share of Series B-1 Preferred or warrant to
purchase Series B-1 Preferred (i) executes the Series C Purchase Agreement and commits to
purchase thereunder an amount of Series C Preferred having an aggregate purchase price at least
equal to such holder’s Pro Rata Share as set forth opposite such holder’s name on Exhibit A-3 to
the Series C Purchase Agreement, and (ii) at the Initial Closing purchases the amount of Series C
Preferred allocated to such holder as set forth opposite such holder’s name under the heading
“Cash Initial Shares” on Exhibit A-1 to the Series C Purchase Agreement. Following the
conversion of such shares of Series B-1 Preferred, the holder thereof shall surrender the certificate
or certificates therefor at the office of the Company or any transfer agent for the Series B-1
Preferred. Upon such surrender, the Company shall issue and deliver to such holder, or to the
nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of
Common to which such holder is entitled. If a holder’s shares of Series B-1 Preferred are
converted pursuant to this Section 4.5.4.1.3(a), then notwithstanding that the certificates
evidencing such shares shall not have been surrendered, all rights with respect to such shares shall
terminate at the Initial Closing, except only the right of the holder to receive certificates
evidencing the shares of Common upon surrender of the certificate evidencing such converted
shares of Series B-1 Preferred. Any dividends or distributions accrued but unpaid at the time of
conversion with respect to a share of Series B-1 Preferred so converted pursuant to this Section
4.5.4.1.3(a), whether declared or not, shall be cancelled. In determining whether any holder of
Series B-1 Preferred has satisfied the criteria set forth in clause (i) of this Section 4.5.4.1.3(a), any
purchases of Series C Preferred under the Series C Purchase Agreement by a Related Party of
such holder that are in excess of the Pro Rata Share of such Related Party shall, to the extent
requested by such holder, be attributed to such holder; provided that no shares constituting part of
such excess shall be attributed to more than one holder of Preferred.

-34-

(b) If the Milestone Closing occurs and a holder of Series B-1 Preferred does not purchase the
number of Milestone Shares allocated to such holder under the Series C Purchase Agreement,
then concurrently with the Milestone Closing (i) each share of Series B-1 Preferred issued to such
holder pursuant to Section 4.5.2.4 shall automatically be redeemed pursuant to the terms of
Section 4.5 of the Series C Purchase Agreement and (ii) each other share of Series B-1 Preferred
held by such holder, or held by such holder at the time of the Initial Closing and subsequently
transferred, shall automatically convert into 0.01 share of Common. Promptly following the
Milestone Closing, the holder of shares so redeemed or converted shall surrender the certificates
therefor at the office of the Company or any transfer agent for the Series B-1 Preferred. In the
case of converted shares, upon such surrender the Company shall issue and deliver to such holder,
or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares
of Common to which such holder is entitled. If a holder’s shares of Series B-1 Preferred are
redeemed or converted pursuant to this Section 4.5.4.1.3(b), then notwithstanding that the
certificates evidencing such shares shall not have been surrendered, all rights with respect to such
shares shall terminate at the Milestone Closing, except only the right of the holder upon surrender
of the certificates evidencing such converted shares to receive certificates evidencing the shares
of Common issued upon such conversion. In determining whether any holder of Series B-1
Preferred has purchased the number of Milestone Shares allocated to such holder under the Series
C Purchase Agreement, any purchases of Milestone Shares under the Series C Purchase
Agreement by a Related Party of such holder that are in excess of the Milestone Shares allocated
to such Related Party under the Series C Purchase Agreement shall, to the extent requested by
such holder, be attributed to such holder; provided that no shares constituting part of such excess
shall be attributed to more than one holder of Preferred.

(c) All shares of Common issued to any holder of Series B-1 Preferred as a result of conversion
pursuant to this Section 4.5.4.1.3 shall be aggregated for the purpose of determining the number
of shares of Common to which such holder shall be entitled, and no fractional shares shall be
issued in connection with such conversion. Any stockholder who would otherwise be entitled to
receive a fractional share of Common as a result of such conversion shall receive in lieu thereof
cash in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the Series C Original Purchase Price (as
defined below).

-35-

4.5.4.2 Mechanics of Conversion.

4.5.4.2.1 Optional Conversion. A holder of any share of Series B-1 Preferred may exercise the Series
B-1 Conversion Right of such share by surrendering the certificate therefor, duly endorsed, at the
office of the Company or of any transfer agent for the Series B-1 Preferred, together with a written
notice to the Company which states:

(A) that such holder elects to convert the same,
(B) the number of shares of Series B-1 Preferred being converted, and

(C) the name or names in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of
Common to be issued.

Thereupon the Company shall promptly issue and deliver to the holder of such shares, or to the
nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of
Common to which such holder shall be entitled. If the certificate evidencing the shares of Series
B-1 Preferred being converted shall also evidence shares of Series B-1 Preferred not being
converted, then the Company shall also deliver to the holder of such certificate, or to the
nominee or nominees of such holder, a new stock certificate evidencing the Series B-1 Preferred
not converted. Any dividends or distributions declared but unpaid at the time of conversion with
respect to a share of Series B-1 Preferred so converted shall be payable ratably to the holders of
the Common issued upon such conversion, pari passu with the payment of such dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to Section 4.4.4.2.1.

4.5.4.2.2 Mandatory Conversion. The Company shall give written notice to each holder of a share of
Series B-1 Preferred (A) not more than forty (40) nor less than twenty (20) days before the
anticipated effective date of the registration statement with respect to any Qualified Public Offering,
and shall also give written notice to each such holder upon the occurrence of any Qualified Public
Offering; and (B) upon the occurrence of any other Series B-1 Mandatory Conversion Event.
Following the conversion of such shares, each holder of shares so converted may surrender the
certificate therefor at the office of the Company or any transfer agent for the Series B-1 Preferred.
Upon such surrender, the Company shall issue and deliver to each holder, or to the nominee or
nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common to which
such holder is entitled. Any dividends or distributions declared but unpaid at the time of conversion
with respect to a share of Series B-1 Preferred so converted shall be payable ratably to the holders of
the Common issued upon such conversion, pari passu with the payment of such dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to Section 4.4.4.2.2.

4.5.4.3 Effective Date of Conversion.

4.5.4.3.1 Optional Conversion. The conversion of any shares of Series B-1 Preferred shall be deemed
to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date that the shares to be
converted are surrendered to the Company together with the notice required by Section 4.5.4.2.1, and
the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common issuable upon such conversion shall
be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common on such date.

- 36-

4.5.4.3.2 Mandatory Conversion. The conversion of shares of Series B-1 Preferred shall take place
upon the first to occur of the Series B-1 Mandatory Conversion Events, whether or not the
certificates representing such shares of Series B-1 Preferred shall have been surrendered, or new
certificates representing the shares of Common into which such shares have been converted shall
have been issued.

4.5.44 Adjustment of Conversion Price.

4.5.4.4.1 Subdivision or Combination of Shares. If the Company at any time subdivides or combines
the outstanding Common after the Filing Date, the Series B-1 Conversion Price shall be decreased, in
the case of a subdivision, or increased, in the case of a combination, in the same proportions as the
Common is subdivided or combined, effective automatically as of the date the Company shall take a
record of the holders of its Common for the purpose of the subdivision or combination (or if no such
record is taken, as of the effectiveness, of the subdivision or combination).

4.5.4.4.2 Stock Dividends. If the Company at any time pays a dividend, or makes any other
distribution, to holders of Common payable in shares of Common, or fixes a record date for the
determination of holders of Common entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in
shares of Common, the Series B-1 Conversion Price shall be decreased by multiplying it by a
fraction:

(A) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common outstanding
immediately prior to such dividend or distribution, and

(B) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common outstanding
immediately after such dividend or distribution (plus, if the Company paid cash instead of
fractional shares otherwise issuable in such dividend or distribution, the number of additional
shares which would have been outstanding had the Company issued fractional shares instead of
cash),

effective automatically as of the date the Company shall take a record of the holders of its
Common for the purpose of receiving such dividend or distribution (or if no such record is
taken, as of the effectiveness of such dividend or distribution).

-37-

4.5.44.3 Reclassification, Consolidation or Merger. If at any time, as a result of:

(A) a capital reorganization or reclassification (other than a subdivision, combination or
dividend which gives rise to adjustment of the Series B-1 Conversion Price pursuant to Sections
4544.1 or 4.5.4.4.2), or

(B) a merger or consolidation of the Company with another corporation (whether or not the
Company is the surviving corporation),

the Common issuable upon the conversion of the Series B-1 Preferred shall be changed into or
exchanged for the same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock of the
Company or any other corporation, or other securities convertible into such shares, then, as a
part of such reorganization, reclassification, merger or consolidation, appropriate adjustments
shall be made in the terms of the Series B-1 Preferred (or of any securities into which the Series
B-1 Preferred is changed or for which the Series B-1 Preferred is exchanged), so that:

(X) the holders of Series B-1 Preferred or of such substitute securities shall thereafter be entitled
to receive, upon conversion of the Series B-1 Preferred or of such substitute securities, the kind
and amount of shares of stock, other securities, money and property which such holders would
have received at the time of such capital reorganization, reclassification, merger, or
consolidation, if such holders had converted their Series B-1 Preferred into Common
immediately prior to such capital reorganization, reclassification, merger, or consolidation, and

(Y) the Series B-1 Preferred or such substitute securities shall thereafter be adjusted on terms as
nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments theretofore provided in Section
4544.

The provisions of this Section 4.5.4.4.3 shall similarly apply to successive capital
reorganizations, reclassifications, mergers, and consolidations.

4.5.4.4.4 Additional Shares of Common. If at any time the Company issues (or is deemed by the
express provisions of Section 4.3.4.4.5 to have issued or sold) Additional Shares of Common without
consideration or for a consideration per share less than the lower of (i) the Series B-1 Conversion
Price in effect at such issuance or (ii) the Series C Conversion Price in effect at such issuance, then
the Series B-1 Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issuance, to a price
(calculated to the nearest cent) equal to the price determined by multiplying the Series B-1
Conversion Price by a fraction:

(A) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Outstanding immediately
prior to the issuance of such Additional Shares of Common plus the number of shares of
Common which the aggregate consideration received (or by the express provisions hereof
deemed to have been received) by the Company for the total number of such Additional Shares
of Common so issued would purchase at the Series B-1 Conversion Price, and

- 38 -
(B) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Outstanding
immediately after the issuance of such Additional Shares of Common;

provided, however, that in no event shall the Series B-1 Conversion Price be reduced below
$.01.

4.5.4.4.5 Convertible Securities. For purposes of the adjustment required under Section 4.5.4.4.4,
Convertible Securities shall be treated as described in Section 4.3.4.4.5.

4.5.4.4.6 Valuation of Consideration. The value of consideration received by the Company for any
issue or sale of securities shall be determined as set forth in Section 4.3.4.4.6.

4.5.4.4.7 Liquidating Dividends. Subject to the preferential rights of holders of Series C Preferred
pursuant to the provisions of Section 4.6.4.4.7, if the Company, at any time while any of the Series
B-1 Preferred is outstanding, shall make a distribution of its assets to the holders of its Common as a
dividend in liquidation or partial liquidation or by way of return of capital or other than as a dividend
payable out of funds legally available for dividends under the laws of the State of Delaware, the
holders of the Series B-1 Preferred shall be entitled to receive, without payment of any consideration
therefor, the assets that would have been payable to them as owners of that number of shares of
Common receivable by exercise of such Series B-1 Conversion Rights, had they been the holders of
record of such Common on the record date for such distribution; and an appropriate provision
therefor shall be made a part of any such distribution in accordance with the preferential provisions
of Section 4.5.3 of this Restated Certificate.

4.5.4.5 Reservation of Shares. The Company will take such corporate action as may be necessary from time
to time so that at all times it will have authorized, and reserved out of its authorized but unissued Common
for the sole purpose of issuance upon conversion of shares of Series B-1 Preferred, a sufficient number of
shares of Common to permit the conversion in full of all outstanding shares of Series B-1 Preferred.

4.5.4.6 Full Consideration. All shares of Common which shall be issued upon the conversion of any Series
B-1 Preferred will, upon issuance, be fully paid and non assessable. The Company will pay such amounts
and will take such other action as may be necessary from time to time so that all shares of Common which
shall be issued upon the exercise of the Series B-1 Conversion Right of any Series B-1 Preferred will, upon
issuance and without cost to the recipient, be free from all preemptive rights, taxes, liens and charges with
respect to the issue thereof.

4.5.4.7 Notice of Adjustment Events. Whenever the Company contemplates the occurrence of an event
which would give rise to adjustments under Section 4.5.4.4, the Company shall mail to each holder of Series
B-1 Preferred, at least 20 days prior to the record date with respect to such event or, if no record date shall be
established, at least 20 days prior to such event, a notice specifying (i) the nature of the contemplated event,
and (ii) the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such event, and (iii) the date on
which such event is expected to become effective, and (iv) the time, if any is to be fixed, when the holders of
record of Common (or other securities) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common (or other
securities) for securities or other property deliverable in connection with such event.

- 39 -

4.5.4.8 Notice of Adjustments. Whenever the Series B-1 Conversion Price or the kind of securities issuable
upon the conversion of Series B-1 Preferred, or both, shall be adjusted pursuant to Section 4.5.4.4, the
Company shall mail to each holder of Series B-1 Preferred, by first class mail postage prepaid, promptly
after each adjustment, a certificate signed by its President or a Vice President and by its Chief Financial
Officer, Secretary or Assistant Secretary, setting forth, in reasonable detail, the event requiring the
adjustment, the amount of the adjustment, the method by which such adjustment was calculated (including a
description of the basis on which the Board of Directors of the Company made any determination
hereunder), and the Series B-1 Conversion Price and the kind of securities issuable upon the conversion of
Series B-1 Preferred after giving effect to such adjustment.
4.5.5 Redemptions. The Series B-1 Preferred shall be redeemed simultaneously with the Series B Preferred in
accordance with the provision of Section 4.4.5.
4.5.6 No Reissuance of Series B-1 Preferred. No share or shares of Series B-1 Preferred acquired by the Company
by reason of redemption, purchase, conversion or otherwise shall be reissued, and all such shares shall be
canceled, retired and eliminated from the shares which the Company shall be authorized to issue.

4.6 Powers and Qualifications of Series C Preferred Stock. The powers, preferences and rights, and the

qualifications, restrictions or limitations, of the Series C Preferred are as follows:

4.6.1 Voting Rights. Except as otherwise required by law or expressly provided in this Restated Certificate, each
share of Series C Preferred (including any fractional share) shall entitle the holder thereof to vote on each
matter submitted to a vote of the shareholders of the Company and to have the number of votes equal to the
number (including any fraction) of shares of Common into which such share of Series C Preferred is then
convertible pursuant to the provisions hereof at the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to
vote on such matter or, if no such record date is established, at the date such vote is taken or any written
consent of shareholders becomes effective. Except as otherwise required by law or expressly provided in this
Restated Certificate, the holders of shares of Common and Preferred of all classes shall vote together and not
as separate classes or series.

4.6.2 Dividends.

4.6.2.1 The holders of Series C Preferred shall be entitled to receive dividends at the rate of 8% of the Series
C Original Purchase Price (as hereafter defined) (such amount to be adjusted proportionately in the event the
shares of Series C Preferred are subdivided into a greater number or combined into a lesser number) per
annum, payable out of funds legally available therefor. Such dividends shall be payable only when, as and if
declared by the Board of Directors and shall be non-cumulative. The “Series C Original Purchase Price”
shall be $0.289018.

- 40 -

4.6.2.2 No dividends (other than those payable on Common solely in shares of Common) shall be paid on
any shares of Series B-1 Preferred, Series B Preferred, Series A Preferred or Common during any fiscal year
of the Company until dividends in the total amount determined in accordance with Section 4.6.2.1 (adjusted
in accordance therewith, if applicable) on the Series C Preferred shall have been paid or declared and set
apart during that fiscal year, and no dividends (other than those payable on Common solely in shares of
Common) shall be paid on any share of Series B-1 Preferred, Series B Preferred, Series A Preferred or
Common, unless a dividend is paid with respect to all outstanding shares of Series C Preferred in an amount
for each such share of Series C Preferred equal to or greater than the aggregate amount of such dividends for
all shares of Common into which each such share of Series C Preferred could then be converted (assuming,
for the purposes of calculating the amount of dividends to be paid under this section, in the case of dividends
declared on shares of Series B-1 Preferred, Series B Preferred or Series A Preferred, that such shares of
Series B-1 Preferred, Series B Preferred or Series A Preferred, as applicable, had been converted into shares
of Common and such dividends had been declared on the shares of Common issued upon conversion
thereof).

4.6.2.3 In the event any dividend or other distribution payable in cash or other property (other than securities
of the Company the issuance of which gives rise, to adjustments pursuant to Section 4.6.4.4 of this Restated
Certificate) is declared on any Common, each holder of shares of Series C Preferred on the record date for
such dividend or distribution shall be entitled to receive, in addition to any dividend under 4.6.2.1, on the
date of payment or distribution of such dividend or other distribution the same cash or other property which
such holder would have received on such record date if such holder were the holder of record of the number
(including any fraction) of shares of Common into which the shares of Series C Preferred then held by such
holder are then convertible.

4.6.3 Liquidation Rights.

4.6.3.1 If the Company shall be voluntarily or involuntarily liquidated, dissolved or wound up, the holder of
each share of Series C Preferred then outstanding (including any fractional shares) shall be entitled to receive
out of the assets of the Company available for distribution to shareholders, and before any payment or
declaration and setting apart for payment of any amount shall be made with respect to the Series B-1
Preferred, Series B Preferred, Series A Preferred or Common, an amount equal to (i) 100% of the Series C
Original Purchase Price (such amount to be adjusted proportionately in the event the shares of Series C
Preferred are subdivided into a greater number or combined into a lesser number), plus (ii) an amount equal
to any dividends on such share which are declared but unpaid as of such liquidation, dissolution or winding
up of the Company.

4.6.3.2 If, upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or
involuntary, the assets to be distributed to the holders of Series C Preferred shall be insufficient to permit the
payment of the full preferential amount pursuant to Section 4.6.3.1 of this Restated Certificate, then all of the
assets of the Company to be distributed shall be distributed ratably to the holders of Series C Preferred.
-A]-

4.6.3.3 Upon the dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary,
the assets of the Company available for distribution to shareholders after and in addition to the distribution
of the preferential amounts pursuant to Sections 4.6.3.1,4.5.3.1, 4.4.3.1 and 4.3.3.1 of this Restated

Certificate, shall be distributed ratably to all holders of Common and Preferred on an “as- converted basis”.

4.6.3 4 For purposes of this Restated Certificate, including without limitation Sections 4.6.3, 4.5.3, 4.4.3 and
4.3.3, unless waived by the holders of at least 60% of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred, each of
the following events shall be treated as a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company and shall
entitle the holders of shares of all series of Preferred and Common to receive at the closing in cash, securities
or other property (valued as provided in Sections 4.3.3.5, 4.4.3.5, 4.5.3.5 and 4.6.3.5) the amounts specified
in Sections 4.3.3.1 through 4.3.3.5, 4.4.3.1 through 4.4.3.5, 4.5.3.1 through 4.5.3.5 and 4.6.3.1 through
4.6.3.5: (i) any acquisition of the Company by means of merger or other form of corporate reorganization in
which outstanding shares of the Company are exchanged for securities or other consideration issued, or
caused to be issued, by the acquiring corporation or its subsidiary (other than a transaction resulting in
ownership of more than 50% of the equity of the acquiring corporation by shareholders of the Company) or
(ii) a sale of the voting control of the Company or (iii) a sale of all on substantially all of the assets of the
Company. The sale of shares of Series C Preferred pursuant to the Series C Purchase Agreement shall not be
treated as a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company.

4.6.3.5 Whenever the distribution provided for in this Section 4.6.3 shall be payable in securities or property
other than cash, the value of such distribution shall be the fair market value of such securities or other
property as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

4.6.4 Conversion.

4.6.4.1 Terms of Conversion.

4.6.4.1.1 Optional Conversion. The holder of each share of Series C Preferred shall have the right
(the “Series C Conversion Right”), at such holder’s option, to convert such share at any time,
without cost and otherwise on the terms of this Section 4.6.4, into the number of fully paid and non-
assessable shares of Common that results from dividing:

(A) $0.289018,
by:

(B) the Series C Conversion Price in effect at the time of conversion.
-42-

The “Series C Conversion Price” shall initially be $0.289018 and shall be subject to adjustment
from time to time as provided in this Section 4.6.4.

4.6.4.12 Mandatory Conversion. All of the outstanding Series C Preferred shall, without any further
action by a holder thereof, convert into Common (a “Series C Mandatory Conversion”) upon the
first to occur of the following (each a “Series C Mandatory Conversion Event”): (A) the
Company’s Qualified Public Offering, (B) at such time as at least 60% of the aggregate number of
shares of Series C Preferred issued prior to such time have been voluntarily converted into Common
by the holders thereof, (C) at such time as is specified in a vote or written consent of the holders of at
least 60% of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred, or (D) at such time as is specified in vote
or written consent of the holders of at least 60% of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred with
respect to the conversion of all Preferred into Common. In each case each share of Series C Preferred
shall be automatically converted, without cost, on the terms of this Section 4.6.4, into the number of
shares of Common into which such share of Series C Preferred would be convertible under 4.6.4.1.1
immediately prior to such conversion.

4.6.4.1.3 Pay to Play Conversion.
(a) If the Milestone Closing occurs and a holder of Series C. Preferred does not purchase the number
of Milestone Shares allocated to such holder under the Series C Purchase Agreement, then
concurrently with the Milestone Closing each share of Series C Preferred held by such holder, or
issued to such holder under the Series C Purchase Agreement and subsequently transferred, shall
automatically convert into the number of shares of Common into which such share of Series C
Preferred would be convertible under 4.6.4.1.1 immediately prior to such conversion. Promptly
following the Milestone Closing, the holder of shares so converted shall surrender the certificates
therefor at the office of the Company or any transfer agent for the Series C Preferred. Upon such
surrender the Company shall issue and deliver to such holder, or to the nominee or nominees of
such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common to which such holder
is entitled. If a holder’s shares of Series C Preferred are converted pursuant to this Section
4.6.4.1.3(a), then notwithstanding that the certificates evidencing such shares shall not have been
surrendered, all rights with respect to such shares shall terminate at the Milestone Closing, except
only the right of the holder upon surrender of the certificates evidencing such converted shares to
receive certificates evidencing the shares of Common issued upon such conversion. In
determining whether any holder of Series C Preferred has purchased the number of Milestone
Shares allocated to such holder under the Series C Purchase Agreement, any purchases of
Milestone Shares under the Series C Purchase Agreement by a Related Party of such holder that
are in excess of the Milestone Shares allocated to such Related Party under the Series C Purchase
Agreement shall, to the extent requested by such holder, be attributed to such holder; provided
that no shares constituting part of such excess shall be attributed to more than one holder of
Preferred. Notwithstanding the foregoing and for avoidance of doubt, the terms of this Section
4.6.4.1.3(a) shall not apply to the reduction in the number of Milestone Shares allocated to
Mizuho Corp. under the Series C Purchase Agreement if such reduction is made solely to comply
with Section 4.5 of the Series C Purchase Agreement.

- 43 -

(b) All shares of Common issued to any holder of Series C Preferred as a result of conversion
pursuant to this Section 4.6.4.1.3 shall be aggregated for the purpose of determining the number
of shares of Common to which such holder shall be entitled, and no fractional shares shall be
issued in connection with such conversion. Any stockholder who would otherwise be entitled to
receive a fractional share of Common as a result of such conversion shall receive in lieu thereof
cash in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the Series C Original Purchase Price.

4.6.4.2 Mechanics of Conversion.

4.6.4.2.1 Optional Conversion. A holder of any share of Series. C Preferred may exercise the Series
C Conversion Right of such share by surrendering the certificate therefor duly endorsed, at the office
of the Company or of any transfer agent for the Series C Preferred, together with a written notice to
the Company which states:

(A) that such holder elects to convert the same,
(B) the number of shares of Series C Preferred being converted, and

(C) the name or names in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of
Common to be issued.

Thereupon the Company shall promptly issue and deliver to the holder of such shares, or to the
nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of
Common to which such holder shall be entitled. If the certificate evidencing the shares of Series
C Preferred being converted shall also evidence shares of Series C Preferred not being
converted, then the Company shall also deliver to the holder of such certificate, or to the
nominee or nominees of such holder, a new stock certificate evidencing the Series C Preferred
not converted. Any dividends or distributions declared but unpaid at the time of conversion with
respect to a share of Series C Preferred so converted shall be payable ratably to the holders of
the Common issued upon such conversion.

4.6.4.2.2 Mandatory Conversion. The Company shall give written notice to each holder of a share of
Series C Preferred (A) not more than forty (40) nor less than twenty (20) days before the anticipated
effective date of the registration statement with respect to any Qualified Public Offering, and shall
also give written notice to each such holder upon the occurrence of any Qualified Public Offering;
and (B) upon the occurrence of any other Series C Mandatory Conversion Event. Following the
conversion of such shares, each holder of shares so converted may surrender the certificate therefor
at the office of the Company or any transfer agent for the Series C Preferred. Upon such surrender,
the Company shall issue and deliver to each holder, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a
certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common to which such holder is entitled. Any
dividends or distributions declared but unpaid at the time of conversion with respect to a share of
Series C Preferred so converted shall be payable ratably to the holders of the Common issued upon
such conversion.

-44-

4.6.4.3 Effective Date of Conversion.

4.6.4.3.1 Optional Conversion. The conversion of any shares of Series C Preferred shall be deemed
to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date that the shares to be
converted are surrendered to the Company together with the notice required by Section 4.6.4.2.1, and
the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common issuable upon such conversion shall
be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common on such date.

4.6.4.3.2 Mandatory Conversion. The conversion of shares of Series C Preferred shall take place
upon the first to occur of the Series C Mandatory Conversion Events, whether or not the certificates
representing such shares of Series C Preferred shall have been surrendered, or new certificates
representing the shares of Common into which such shares have been converted shall have been
issued.

4.6.44 Adjustment of Conversion Price.

4.6.4.4.1 Subdivision or Combination of Shares. If the Company at any time subdivides or combines
the outstanding Common after the Filing Date, the Series C Conversion Price shall be decreased, in
the case of a subdivision, or increased, in the case of a combination, in the same proportions as the
Common is subdivided or combined, effective automatically as of the date the Company shall take a
record of the holders of its Common for the purpose of the subdivision or combination (or if no such
record is taken, as of the effectiveness of the subdivision or combination).

4.6.4.4.2 Stock Dividends. If the Company at any time pays a dividend, or makes any other
distribution, to holders of Common payable in shares of Common, or fixes a record date for the
determination of holders of Common entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in
shares of Common, the Series C Conversion Price shall be decreased by multiplying it by a fraction:

(A) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common outstanding
immediately prior to such dividend or distribution, and
-45-

(B) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common outstanding
immediately after such dividend or distribution (plus, if the Company paid cash instead of
fractional shares otherwise issuable in such dividend or distribution, the number of additional
shares which would have been outstanding had the Company issued fractional shares instead of
cash),

effective automatically as of the date the Company shall take a record of the holders of its
Common for the purpose of receiving such dividend or distribution (or if no such record is
taken, as of the effectiveness of such dividend or distribution).

4.64.4.3 Reclassification, Consolidation or Merger. If at any time, as a result of:

(A) a capital reorganization or reclassification (other than a subdivision, combination or
dividend which gives rise to adjustment of the Series C Conversion Price pursuant to Sections
4644.1 or 4.6.4.4.2), or

(B) a merger or consolidation of the Company with another corporation (whether or not the
Company is the surviving corporation),
the Common issuable upon the conversion of the Series C Preferred shall be changed into or
exchanged for the same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock of the
Company or any other corporation, or other securities convertible into such shares, then, as a
part of such reorganization, reclassification, merger or consolidation, appropriate adjustments
shall be made in the terms of the Series C Preferred (or of any securities into which the Series C
Preferred is changed or for which the Series C Preferred is exchanged), so that:

(X) the holders of Series C Preferred or of such substitute securities shall thereafter be entitled to
receive, upon conversion of the Series C Preferred or of such substitute securities, the kind and
amount of shares of stock, other securities, money and property which such holders would have
received at the time of such capital reorganization, reclassification, merger, or consolidation, if
such holders had converted their Series C Preferred into Common immediately prior to such
capital reorganization, reclassification, merger, or consolidation, and

(Y) the Series C Preferred or such substitute securities shall thereafter be adjusted on terms as
nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments theretofore provided in Section
4.644.

- 46 -

The provisions of this Section 4.6.4.4.3 shall similarly apply to successive capital
reorganizations, reclassifications, mergers, and consolidations.

4.6.4.4.4 Additional Shares of Common. If at any time the Company issues (or is deemed by the
express provisions of Section 4.3.4.4.5 to have issued or sold) Additional Shares of Common without
consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Series C Conversion Price in effect at
such issuance, then the Series C Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issuance,
to a price (calculated to the nearest cent) equal to the price determined by multiplying the Series C
Conversion Price by a fraction:

(A) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Outstanding immediately
prior to the issuance of such Additional Shares of Common plus the number of shares of
Common which the aggregate consideration received (or by the express provisions hereof
deemed to have been received) by the Company for the total number of such Additional Shares
of Common so issued would purchase at the Series C Conversion Price, and

(B) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Outstanding
immediately after the issuance of such Additional Shares of Common;

provided, however, that in no event shall the Series C Conversion Price be reduced below $.01.

4.6.4.4.5 Convertible Securities. For purposes of the adjustment required under Section 4.6.4.4.4,
Convertible Securities shall be treated as described in Section 4.3.4.4.5.

4.6.4.4.6 Valuation of Consideration. The value of consideration received by the Company for any
issue or sale of securities shall be determined as set forth in Section 4.3.4.4.6.

4.64.4.7 Liquidating Dividends. If the Company, at any time while any of the Series C Preferred is
outstanding, shall make a distribution of its assets to the holders of its Common as a dividend in
liquidation or partial liquidation or by way of return of capital or other than as a dividend payable out
of funds legally available for dividends under the laws of the State of Delaware, the holders of the
Series C Preferred shall be entitled to receive, without payment of any consideration therefor, the
assets that would have been payable to them as owners of that number of shares of Common
receivable by exercise of such Series C Conversion Rights, had they been the holders of record of
such Common on the record date for such distribution; and an appropriate provision therefor shall be
made a part of any such distribution in accordance with the preferential provisions of Section 4.6.3 of
this Restated Certificate.

-AT-

4.6.4.5 Reservation of Shares. The Company will take such corporate action as may be necessary from time
to time so that at all times it will have authorized, and reserved out of its authorized but unissued Common
for the sole purpose of issuance upon conversion of shares of Series C Preferred, a sufficient number of
shares of Common to permit the conversion in full of all outstanding shares of Series C Preferred.

4.6.4.6 Full Consideration. All shares of Common which shall be issued upon the conversion of any Series C
Preferred will, upon issuance, be fully paid and non- assessable. The Company will pay such amounts and
will take such other action as may be necessary from time to time so that all shares of Common which shall
be issued upon the exercise of the Series C Conversion Right of any Series C Preferred will, upon issuance
and without cost to the recipient, be free from all preemptive rights, taxes, liens and charges with respect to
the issue thereof.

4.6.4.7 Notice of Adjustment Events. Whenever the Company contemplates the occurrence of an event
which would give rise to adjustments under Section 4.6.4.4, the Company shall mail to each holder of Series
C Preferred, at least 20 days prior to the record date with respect to such event or, if no record date shall be
established, at least 20 days prior to such event, a notice specifying (i) the nature of the contemplated event,
and (ii) the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such event, and (iii) the date on
which such event is expected to become effective, and (iv) the time, if any is to be fixed, when the holders of
record of Common (or other securities) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common (or other
securities) for securities or other property deliverable in connection with such event.

4.6.4.8 Notice of Adjustments. Whenever the Series C Conversion Price or the kind of securities issuable
upon the conversion of Series C Preferred, or both, shall be adjusted pursuant to Section 4.6.4.4, the
Company shall mail to each holder of Series C Preferred, by first class mail postage prepaid, promptly after
each adjustment, a certificate signed by its President or a Vice President and by its Chief Financial Officer,
Secretary or Assistant Secretary, setting forth, in reasonable detail, the event requiring the adjustment, the
amount of the adjustment, the method by which such adjustment was calculated (including a description of
the basis on which the Board of Directors of the Company made any determination hereunder), and the
Series C Conversion Price and the kind of securities issuable upon the conversion of Series C Preferred after
giving effect to such adjustment.

4.6.5 Redemption.

4.6.5.1 “Redemption Trigger Date” has the meaning ascribed thereto in Section 4.3.5.1 above.

4.6.5.2 At any time on or after the Redemption Trigger Date, the holders of at least 60% of the outstanding
Series C Preferred shall have the right to elect to require the Company to redeem all outstanding shares of
Series C Preferred. Within not more than fifteen (15) business days after receipt of written notice of such
election (“Series C Redemption Election”), the Company will provide a written notice (“Series C
Redemption Notice”) advising each holder of Series C Preferred of the proposed redemption in the form
required under Section 4.6.5.3.1. The Board of Directors shall establish the date on which the Series C
Preferred will be redeemed (“Series C Redemption Date”), which date will be not less than thirty (30) nor
more than ninety (90) days after the date the Company receives the Series C Redemption Election. On the
Series C Redemption Date, the Company will redeem for cash, out of funds legally available for such
purpose, all shares of Series C Preferred at a price per share equal to the Series C Original Purchase Price
(such amount to be adjusted proportionately in the event the shares of Series C Preferred are subdivided into
a greater number or combined into a lesser number) plus all declared but unpaid dividends on such shares
(the “Series C Redemption Price”).

- 48 -

4.6.5.2.1 The Series C Redemption Notice shall state:

(a) that the holders of at least 60% of the outstanding Series C Preferred have elected to require the
Company to redeem all outstanding shares of Series C Preferred,

(b) the amount of funds legally available for such redemption and the maximum number of shares of
Series C Preferred the Company can redeem,

(c) the Series C Redemption Date, and

(d) _ that each holder is to surrender to the Company in the manner designated at the Company’s
principal place of business, its certificate or certificates representing the shares of Series C
Preferred to be redeemed.

4.6.5.3 Each holder of shares of Series C Preferred being redeemed shall surrender the certificate or
certificates representing such shares to the Company, at the Company’s principal place of business. Upon
such surrender (but not earlier than the Series C Redemption Date) the Series C Redemption Price for such
shares shall be payable to the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as
the owner thereof, and each surrendered certificate shall be cancelled and retired. If a certificate is
surrendered and all the shares evidenced thereby cannot be redeemed, the Company shall cause certificates
evidencing the shares not being redeemed to be issued in the name of the registered owner of such shares and
to be delivered to such person.

4.6.5.4 If the Series C Redemption Price is either paid or made available for payment through the deposit
arrangement specified in Section 4.6.5.6 with respect to any shares of Series C Preferred, then
notwithstanding that the certificates evidencing any of the shares to be redeemed shall not have been
surrendered, all rights with respect to such shares shall terminate as of the Series C Redemption Date, except
only the right of the holder to receive the Series C Redemption Price upon surrender of the certificate
evidencing such shares.

4.6.5.5 Within 10 business days of the Company’s receipt of the Series C Redemption Election, the
Company shall deposit with any bank or trust company having a capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000
as a trust fund, a sum equal to the aggregate Series C Redemption Price of all outstanding shares of Series C
Preferred with irrevocable instructions and authority to the bank or trust company to pay, on or after the
Series C Redemption Date, the Series C Redemption Price to the respective holders of Series C Preferred
upon the surrender of their share certificates. From and after the date of such deposit, the shares so called for
redemption shall be redeemed. The deposit shall constitute full payment of the shares to their holders, and
from and after the Series C Redemption Date, the shares shall be deemed to be no longer outstanding, and
the holders thereof shall cease to be shareholders with respect thereto and shall have no rights with respect
thereto except the rights to receive from the bank or trust company payment of the Series C Redemption
Price of the shares, without interest, upon surrender of their certificates therefor (and a certificate for those
shares, if any, evidenced by such certificates which are not being redeemed on such Series C Redemption
Date). Any funds so deposited and unclaimed at the end of one year from such Series C Redemption Date
shall be released or repaid to the Company, after which the former holders of the shares called for
redemption shall be entitled to receive payment of the Series C Redemption Price with respect to such shares
only from the Company.

- 49 -

4.6.5.6 Subject to Section 4.6.5.2 hereof, if the funds of the Company legally available therefor shall be
insufficient to discharge the Series C Preferred redemption requirement in full, funds to the extent legally
available for such purpose shall be set aside upon the Company’s receipt of a Series C Redemption Election
in accordance with Sections 4.6.5.6. The maximum number of full shares of Series C Preferred that can be
redeemed with such funds shall be redeemed from the holders of shares of Series C Preferred as of the date
of such Series C Redemption Election ratably in accordance with the full amounts otherwise payable to
them. Thereafter, the Company shall redeem shares of Series C Preferred ratably from the holders thereof as
funds legally available therefor become available.

4.6.5.7 Nothing in this Section 4.6.5 shall prevent any holder of shares of Series C Preferred from exercising
the Series C Conversion Right of such shares at any time prior to the actual redemption of such shares.

4.6.6 No Reissuance of Series C Preferred. No share or shares of Series C Preferred acquired by the Company by
reason of redemption, purchase, conversion or otherwise shall be reissued, and all such shares shall be
canceled, retired and eliminated from the shares which the Company shall be authorized to issue.

4.6.7 Protective Provisions. For so long as any shares of Series C Preferred remain outstanding, consent of the
holders of at least 60% of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred shall be required for any action that (i)
alters or changes the rights, preferences or privileges of the Series C Preferred, (ii) increases or decreases the
authorized number of shares of Series C Preferred, (iii) increases or decreases the authorized number of shares
of Common or Preferred, (iv) creates (by reclassification or otherwise) any new class or series of shares
having rights, preferences or privileges senior to or on a parity with the Series C Preferred, (v) results in the
redemption of any shares of Common (other than pursuant to equity incentive agreements with employees or
service providers giving the Company the right to repurchase shares upon the termination of employment or
services), (vi) results in any merger, other corporate reorganization, sale of control, or any transaction in which
all or substantially all of the assets of the Company are sold, (vii) amends or waives any provision of this
Restated Certificate or the Bylaws of the Company, (viii) increases or decreases the authorized size of the
Company’s Board of Directors, (ix) creates or amends any employee stock option or incentive plan, (x) results
in the payment or declaration of any dividend on any shares of Common or Preferred or (xi) makes or permits
any material change in the nature of the business of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
