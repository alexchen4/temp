shares of Redeemed Preferred to be redeemed on such date, those funds that are legally available
will be used to redeem shares from the holders of Redeemed Preferred ratably in proportion to
the number of shares of Redecmed Preferred held by each holder as of such Redemption Date.
The shares of Redeemed Preferred not redeemed shall remain outstanding and entitle the holder
thereof to all the rights and preferences provided herein, including the rights of conversion set
forth in Section 4 below. If any time thereafter, additional funds become legally available for the
redemption, such funds will immediately be used to redeem the balance of the shares that the
Corporation has become obliged to redeem on any Redemption Date but which it has not

Corporation's assets in determining the funds legally available for the redemption of shares.

shares to be redeemed from such holder, the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price and the

shares, in the manner and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice. Each surrendered
certificate shall be cancelled, and the Redemption Price for such shares shall then be payable to
the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner
thereof. If less than all the shares represented by any such certificate are redeemed, a new
certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares. Nothing herein shall be deemed
to prevent a holder of Redeemed Preferred from converting all or part of such holder's shares into
Common Stock in accordance with the terms of Section4 hereof at any time prior to a
Redemption Date covering such shares, and the provisions of this Section 3 shall not apply to
any shares so converted.

(d) From and after each Redemption Date, unless there has been a default in
payment of the Redemption Price, the shares of Redeemed Preferred designated for redemption
in the Redemption Notice for such Redemption Date shall cease to be outstanding and shall no
longer be transferred on the books of the Corporation, and all rights of the holders with respect to
such shares shall cease, except the right to receive the Redemption Price without additional
interest upon surrender of their certificate or certificates.

redeemed, with irrevocable instructions and authority to the bank or trust corporation to publish
the notice of redemption thereof and pay the Redemption Price for such shares to their respective
holders on or after the Redemption Date, upon reccipt of notification from the Corporation that
such holder has surrendered his, her or its share certificate to the Corporation pursuant to
subsection (3)(c) above. Such instructions shall also provide that any monies deposited by the
Corporation pursuant to this subsection (3)(e) for the redemption of shares thereafter converted
into shares of the Corporation's Common Stock pursuant to Section 4 hereof prior to the
Redemption Date shall be returned to the Corporation forthwith upon such conversion. The
balance of any moneys deposited by this Corporation pursuant to this subsection (3)(c)
remaining unclaimed at the expiration of one (1) year following the Redemption Date shall

thereafter be returned to the Corporation upon its request expressed in a resolution of its board of
directors.

(f) At no time shall the Corporation redeem any outstanding share of Series A
Preferred Stock so long as any Series E Preferred, Series D Preferred, Series C Preferred or
Series B Preferred remains issued and outstanding.

4. Conversion

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at
the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share, at the office
of the Corporation or any transfer agent for such stock, into such number of fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing (i) the Original Issue Price
for such series of Preferred Stock by (ii) the then effective Conversion Price for such series of
Preferred Stock (such quotient, the "Conversion Rate"). The initial Series A Conversion Price,
the initial Series B Conversion Price, the initial Series C Conversion Price, the initial Series D
Conversion Price and the initial Series E Conversion Price shall be $3.3250, $0.8773, $0.5623,
$0.2918 and $0.2927, respectively. The Conversion Prices for all series of Preferred Stock are
subject to adjustment as provided in this Section 4.

(b) Automatic_Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall
automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the then effective Conversion Rate
for such series upon the closing of a firm commitment underwritten public offering of Common
Stock for the account of the Corporation to the public pursuant to an effective registration
statement under the Securities Act of 1933 at a price per share (prior to underwriter commissions
and offering expenses) of not less than five (5) times the Series E Original Issue Price per share
(as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, recapitalizations or splits with respect to such
shares) and net proceeds to the Corporation of not less than $30,000,000 (after deduction of
underwriter commissions and offering expenses) (a "Qualified IPO"). In addition, each share of
a series of Preferred Stock shall automatically convert (i) with the approval, by affirmative vote,
written consent or other agreement of the holders of not less than (x) fifty percent (50%) of the
outstanding Series A Preferred, Serics B Preferred and Series C Preferred (in the case of the
automatic conversion of the Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred and Series C Preferred)
voting together as a single class on an as-converted basis, (y) fifty-five percent (55%) of the
outstanding Series D Preferred (in the case of the automatic conversion of the Series D
Preferred) voting as a separate class on an as-converted basis or (z) fifty-one percent (51%) of

-8-

34859-0013/LEGAL!3249243.8
the outstanding Series E Preferred (in the case of the automatic conversion of the Series E
Preferred) voting as a separate class on an as-converted basis, or (ii) upon the voluntary
conversion by the holders of (x) not less than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding Series A
Preferred, Series B Preferred and Series C Preferred (in the case of the automatic conversion of
the Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred and Series C Preferred), (y) at least fifty-five percent
(55%) ‘of the outstanding Series D Preferred (in the case of the automatic conversion of the
Series D Preferred) or (z) at least fifty-one percent (51%) of the outstanding Series E Preferred
(in the case of the automatic conversion of the Series E Preferred).

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall
be issued upon conversion of the Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the
holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction
multiplied by the then effective Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock. Conversion
of shares of Preferred Stock at the option of the holder thereof shall be effected by delivery, to
the office of the Corporation or to any transfer agent for such shares, of duly endorsed
certificates for the shares being converted and of written notice to the Corporation that the holder
elects to convert such shares. Conversion shall be deemed to occur immediately prior to the
close of business on the date the shares and notice are delivered. Automatic conversion of the
Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 4(b) shall be effective without any further action on the part
of the holders of such shares and shall be effective whether or not the certificates for such shares
are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent. Holders entitled to receive Common
Stock upon conversion of Preferred Stock shall be treated for all purposes as the record holders
of such shares of Common Stock on the date conversion is deemed to occur. The Corporation
shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of Preferred Stock unless either (i) the certificates evidencing such shares being
converted are delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent as provided above, or (ii) the
holder (A) notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost,
stolen or destroyed and (B) executes an agreement, and at the Corporation's election provides a
surety bond or other security, satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from
any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates. The Corporation shall, as soon as
practicable after the delivery of such certificates, or the agreement to indemnify in the case of a
lost certificate, issue and deliver to the holder of the shares of Preferred Stock being converted, a
certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which the holder is
entitled and a check payable to the holder for any cash due with respect to fractional shares.

(d) Adjustments of Conversion Price for Certain Diluting Issuances,
Splits and Combinations. The applicable Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock
shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows (provided, however, that the
Conversion Price applicable to the Series A Preferred shall not be subject to adjustment pursuant
to subsection (i) of this Section 4(d)):

(i) Adjustment of Conversion Price upon Issuance of Additional
Shares of Common Stock below the Conversion Price. If the Corporation issues Additional

Shares of Common Stock (including Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued
pursuant to Section 4(d)(i)(D)) without consideration or for a consideration per share less than
the Conversion Price for the Series E Preferred in effect immediately prior to such issue, then
and in such event, such Conversion Price for Serics B Preferred, Series C Preferred, Series D

9.

34859-0013/LEGAL13249243.8
Preferred and Series E Preferred, as applicable, shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to
a price (calculated to the nearest hundredth of a cent) as set forth herein, unless otherwise
provided in this Section 4.

(A) Adjustment Formula.

(1) With respect to any adjustment occurring after the
date hereof and prior to the twelve (12) month anniversary of the date hereof, the new Series E
Conversion Price shall be determined by reducing the Series E Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such adjustment, concurrently with such issue, to a price equal to the
Effective Price of such Additional Shares of Common Stock. The "Effective Price" of
Additional Shares of Common Stock shall mean the quotient determined by dividing (i) the
aggregate consideration received, or under Section 4(d)(i)(E) deemed to have been received, by
the Corporation for such Additional Shares of Common Stock, by (i1) the total number of
Additional Shares of Common Stock issued or sold, or under Section 4(d)(i)(D) deemed to have
been issued or sold.

(2) With respect to any adjustment occurring on or
following the twelve (12) month anniversary of the date hereof, the new Series E Conversion
Price shall be adjusted to the price determined by multiplying the Series E Conversion Price in
effect immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction (the "Weighted Average"), the
numerator of which shall be the number of shares of "Common Stock Outstanding” immediately
prior to such issuance (including shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to
Section 4(d)(i)(E)) plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration
received by the Corporation for such issuance would purchase at such Series E Conversion Price
in effect immediately prior to such issue; and the denominator of which shall be the number of
shares of "Common Stock Outstanding" immediately prior to such issuance (including shares of
Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to Section 4(d)(i)(E)) plus the number of shares of
such Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued. For the purpose of this paragraph, the
number of shares of "Common Stock Outstanding" shall be deemed to include all Common
Stock issued and outstanding, any Common Stock issuable upon conversion of issued and
outstanding Preferred Stock, and any Common Stock issuable upon exercise or conversion of all
other outstanding Convertible Securities and Options whether vested or unvested and whether or
not immediately exercisable (assuming conversion of Convertible Securities issuable upon
exercise of Options therefor).

(3) | Whenever the Conversion Price for Series B
Preferred, Series C Preferred or Series D Preferred is adjusted pursuant to this Section 4(d)(i),
the new Series B Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price and/or Series D Conversion Price,
as the case may be, shall be adjusted to a price determined by multiplying the Series B
Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price and/or Series D Conversion Price, as the case may
be, in effect immediately prior to such adjustment by the Weighted Average.

combinations, recapitalizations or splits with respect to such shares following the date of this
Fifth Restated Certificate) for subscription by holders of the Company's Series B Preferred,

deemed to be a "Nonparticipating Holder." For each Nonparticipating Holder, that number of

-12-

“

34859-001 3/LEGAL13249243.8
outstanding shares of Series B Preferred, Series C Preferred and Series D Preferred equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Series B Preferred, Series C
Preferred and Series D Preferred (including outstanding warrants to purchase Series B Preferred,
Series C Preferred and Series D Preferred) held by the Nonparticipating Holder by (y) the

Date"), be automatically converted into Common Stock at the then applicable Conversion
Rate(s) for such shares of Series B Preferred, Series C Preferred or Series D Preferred,
respectively, and no adjustment to such Conversion Price(s) or Conversion Rate(s) shall be made
in respect of such issuance of shares of Series E Preferred. If a Nonparticipating Holder holds

Percentage shal! be allocated between such shares in proportion to the number of shares of Series
B Preferred and Series C Preferred and Series D Preferred held by such Nonparticipating Holder
as of the date of the Issuance Notice. For purposes of this Section (B)(4)(d)(i)(C)(2), the term
"Declined Percentage" shall mean the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the lesser of (A) such
Nonparticipating Holder's Pro-Rata Portion minus the amount of Series E Preferred actually
purchased by such Nonparticipating Holder, and (B) 68,327,296 shares of Series E Preferred (as

Nonparticipating Holder's Pro-Rata Portion.

(4) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the application of
Section (B)(4)(d)@)(C)(3) above shall be automatically waived with respect to all Major Holders
and no shares of Series B Preferred, Series C Preferred and Series D Preferred held by such
Nonparticipating Holder shall be converted by operation of such section in the event the
Corporation sells at least 68,327,296 shares of Series E Preferred (as adjusted for any stock
dividends, combinations, recapitalizations or splits with respect to such shares following the date
of this Fifth Restated Certificate) to new or existing investors prior to the Mandatory Offering
Date, regardless of individual] participation in such financing by the Major Holders.

Corporation for the Series B Preferred, Series C Preferred and Series D Preferred, or at such

so converted, duly endorsed or assigned in blank to this Corporation. As promptly as practicable
thereafter, this Corporation shall issue and deliver to such holder, at the place designated by such
holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of the Common Stock to be
issued and such holder shall be deemed to have become a stockholder of record of Common
Stock on the Mandatory Offering Date, unless the transfer books of this Corporation are closed
on that date, in which event such holder shall be deemed to have become a stockholder of record
of Common Stock on the next succeeding date on which the transfer books are open. From and
after the Mandatory Offering Date, the certificate or certificates representing shares of Series B
Preferred, Series C Preferred and Series D Preferred converted pursuant to Section
(B)(4)(d)(i)(C)(3) shall represent the shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series B

34859-0013/LEGAL13249243.8
(D) Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock.
If the Corporation at any time after the Original Issue Date of the Series E Preferred shall issue
any Options or Convertible Securities or shall fix a record date for the determination of any
holders of any class of securities entitled to receive any such Options or Convertible Securities,
then the maximum number of shares (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto without
regard fo any provisions contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) of
Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case of Convertible
Securities and Options for Convertible Securities, the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to be Additional Shares of Common Stock issued as of
the time of such issuance or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of
business on such record date, provided that in any such case in which Additional Shares of
Common Stock are deemed to be issued:

(1) no further adjustment to the Conversion Price for
any series of Preferred Stock shall be made upon the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities,
or Common Stock issued upon the exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities;

(2) if such Options or Convertible Securities by their
terms provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any increase or decrease in the
consideration payable to the Corporation, or increase or decrease in the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable, upon the exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, then the Conversion
Price for each affected series of Preferred Stock computed upon the original issuance thereof (or
upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based
thereon, shall, upon any such increase or decrease becoming effective, be recomputed to reflect
such increase or decrease insofar as it affects such Options or the rights of conversion or
exchange under such Convertible Securities;

(3) upon the expiration of any such Options or any
rights of conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities that have not been exercised,
the Conversion Price for each affected series of Preferred Stock computed upon the original issue
thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent
adjustments based thereon, shall, upon such expiration, be recomputed as if:

(1) in the case of Convertible Securities or
Options for Common Stock, the only additional shares of Common Stock issued were shares of
Common Stock, if any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, and the consideration received therefor was the
consideration actually received by the Corporation for the issuance of all such Options, whether
or not exercised, plus the consideration actually received by the Corporation upon such exercise,
or for the issuance of all such Convertible Securities that were actually converted or exchanged,
plus the additional consideration, if any, actually received by the Corporation upon such
conversion or exchange, and

(ii) in the case of Options for Convertible
Securities, only the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were

-14-

34859-0013/LEGAL13249243.8
issued at the time of issue of such Options and the consideration received by the Corporation for
the Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been then issued was the consideration
actually received by the Corporation for the issuance of all such Options, whether or not
exercised, plus the consideration deemed to have been received by the Corporation upon the

issuance of the Convertible Securities with respect to which such Options were actually
exercised;

(4) no readjustment pursuant to subsections (2) or (3)
above shall have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock to
an amount which exceeds the lesser of (x) the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred
Stock, on the original adjustment date, or (y) the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred
Stock that would have resulted from any issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock
between the original adjustment date and such readjustment date, and no readjustment shall
affect Common Stock issued on conversion of Preferred Stock prior to such readjustment; and

(5) in the case of any Options that expire by their terms
not more than ninety (90) days after the date of issue thereof, no adjustment of the Conversion

Price for any series of Preferred Stock shall be made until the expiration or exercise of all such
Options.

{E) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this
Section 4(d), the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional
Shares of Common Stock shall be computed as follows:

(1) Cash and Property. Such consideration shall:

(D insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at
the aggregate amount of cash received by the Corporation prior to amounts paid or payable for
accrued interest or declared dividends and prior to any commissions or expenses paid by the
Corporation;

(II) insofar as it consists of property other than
cash, be computed at the fair value thereof at the time of such issuc, as determined in good faith
by the board of directors; and

(IN) if Additional Shares of Common Stock are
issued together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for consideration
which covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received for the Additional Shares
of Common Stock, computed as provided in subsections (1) and (II) above, as determined in
good faith by the board of directors.

(2) Options and Convertible Securities. The
consideration per share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock

deemed to have been issued pursuant to Section 4(d)(i)(D), in respect of Options and Convertible
Securities, shall be determined by dividing:

-]5-

34859-001 3/LEGAL1 3249243.8
¢9) the total amount, if any, received or
receivable by the Corporation as consideration for the issuance of such Options or Convertible
Securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the
instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent
adjustment of such consideration) payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such Option or
the converston or exchange of such Convertible Securities, or im the case of Options for
Convertible Securitics, the exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities and the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities by

(11) the maximum number of shares of Common
Stock (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained
therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options
or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities.

(ii) Adjustments for Stock Dividends, Combinations or Splits. If,
after the date of this Fifth Restated Certificate, the outstanding shares of Common Stock are

subdivided, by stock split or otherwise, into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, or if
the Corporation shall declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of
Common Stock, then the Conversion Prices in effect prior to such event shall be proportionately
decreased upon the occurrence of such event. If, after the date of this Fifth Restated Certificate,
the outstanding shares of Common Stock are combined or consolidated, by reclassification,
reverse stock split or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then the
Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock in effect prior to such event shall be
proportionately increased upon the occurrence of such event.

(e) Adjustments for Other Distributions. If, after the date of this Fifth
Restated Certificate, the Corporation fixes a record date for the determination of holders of
Common Stock entitled to receive any distribution payable in securities of the Corporation other
than shares of Common Stock (excluding any distribution in which the Preferred Stock
participates on an as-converted basis, and any distribution for which adjustment is otherwise
made pursuant to this Section 4), then in each such case provision shall be made so that the
holders of Preferred Stock receive upon conversion, in addition to the Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of their shares, the property or other securities of the Corporation that they
would otherwise have received had their shares of Preferred Stock been converted into Common
Stock immediately prior to such event and had they thereafter retained such securities, subject to
all other adjustments called for during such period under this Section 4 of this Division (B).

(f) Adjustments for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. If, after
the date of this Fifth Restated Certificate, the Common Stock is changed into the same or a

different number of shares of any other class or series of stock, whether by capital
reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a Deemed Liquidation under Section 2 of
this Division B, and events for which adjustment is made pursuant to Sections 4(d)(ii) or 4(e)
above of this Division (B)), the Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock then in effect
shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such reorganization, reclassification or change, be
adjusted such that the Preferred Stock shall be convertible into, in lieu of the Common Stock
which the holders thereof would otherwise have been entitled to receive, a number of shares of
such other class or series of capital stock equivalent to the number of shares of such other class

-16-

34859-0013/LEGAL] 3249243.8
or series of capital stock that such holders would have been entitled to receive in such
reclassification, capital reorganization or change for the number of shares of Common Stock that
the holders would have been entitled to receive upon conversion of their Preferred Stock
immediately prior to such reclassification, capital reorganization or change.

-(g) No Impairment. The Corporation will not without first obtaining the
consent of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of each affected series of
Preferred Stock, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be
observed or performed under this Section 4 by the Corporation, but will at all times in good faith
assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Section 4 and in the taking of all such action
as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holders of the
Preferred Stock under this Section 4 against impairment.

(h) Certificate as to Adjustments. The Corporation shall promptly compute
any Conversion Price adjustments and provide each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate
describing such adjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment is based.
If requested in writing by any holder of Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall provide such
holder a certificate describing any Conversion Price adjustments, the current Conversion Price
and the amount of Common Stock or other property issuable upon conversion of the shares of
Preferred Stock held by such holder.

(i) Notices of Record Date, Ifthe Corporation shall propose at any time:

(A) to declare any dividend or distribution upon its Common
Stock other than a distribution payable solely in Common Stock;

(B) to effect any reclassification or recapitalization of its
Common Stock; or

(C) to merge or consolidate with or into any other corporation,
or sell, lease or convey all or substantially all its property or business, or to liquidate, dissolve or
wind up;

Then, in connection with each such event, the Corporation shal! send to
the holders of the Preferred Stock:

(1) at least twenty (20) days' prior written notice of the
date on which a record shall be taken for such dividend, distribution or subscription rights (and
specifying the date on which the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled thereto) or for
determining rights to vote in respect of the matters referred to in (C) and (D) above; and

(2) in the case of the matters referred to in (C) and (D)
above, at least twenty (20) days' prior written notice of the date when the same shall take place
(and specifying the date on which the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to exchange

their Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon the occurrence of such
event).

-17-

34859-001 3/LEGAL]3249243.8
Each such written notice shall be delivered personally or given by first
class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the holders of Preferred Stock at the addresses for such
stockholders as shown on the books of the Corporation.

Qj) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall
at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common
Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock,
such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, in addition to such other remedies as shall
be available to the holder of such Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate
action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes,
including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval
of any necessary amendment to this Fifth Restated Certificate.

5. Voting

(a) General Voting Rights. The holders of Series A Preferred shall not be
