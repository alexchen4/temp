which it is due, on the date it was mailed by United States registered or certified mail to that address.

This notice shall be used to indicate reliance on the Uniform Limited Offering Exemption (ULOE) for sales of securities in those states that have adopted

are to be, or have been made. Ifa state requires the payment of a fee as a precondition to the claim for the exemption, a fee in the proper amount shall
accompany this form. This notice shall be filed in the appropriate states in accordance with state law. The Appendix to the notice constitutes a part of
