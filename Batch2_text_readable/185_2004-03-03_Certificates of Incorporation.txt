The corporation is authorized to issue two classes of stock to be designated, respectively,
“Common Stock" and "Preferred Stock." The total number of shares of Common Stock that the
corporation is authorized to issue is 40,000,000, with a par value of $0.001 per share. The total
number of shares of Preferred Stock that the corporation is authorized to issue is 20,000,000, with a
par value of $0.001 per share, 3,000,000 of which are designated "Series A Preferred Stock," and
10.000,000 of which are designated "Series B Preferred Stock."

The corporation shall from time to time in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware
increase the authorized amount of its Common Stock if at any time the number of shares of Common
Stock remaining unissued and available for issuance upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall
not be sufficient to permit conversion of the Preferred Stock, The number of authorized shares of
Common Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares of Common
Stock then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock of the
corporation (voting together as a single class on an as-if-converted basis).

The undesignated Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series.
Subject to Section 4(c), the corporation's board of directors is authorized to determine the
designation of any series, to fix the number of shares of any series of the undesignated Preferred
Stock, and to determine or alter the rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions granted to or
imposed upon any wholly unissued series of undesignated Preferred Stock, and, within the limits and
restrictions stated in any resolution or resolutions of the corporation's board of directors originally
fixing the number of shares constituting any series of the undesignated Preferred Stock, to increase
or decrease (but not below the number of shares of any such series then outstanding) the number of
shares of any such series subsequent to the issue of shares of that series. In case the number of
shares of any series shal] be so decreased, the shares constituting such decrease shall resume the
status which they had prior to the adoption of the resolution originally fixing the number of shares of
such series.

The relative rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to or imposed upon the
respective classes and series of the shares of capital stock or the holders thereof are as set forth
below.

Section 1. Dividends. The holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
receive, for each share of Series A Preferred Stock held by such holders, out of any funds legally
available therefor, noncumulative cash dividends at the rate of ten percent (10%) of the Original
Issue Price (as defined below) per annum (as adjusted for any recapitalizations, stock combinations,
stock dividends, stock splits and the like), when, as and if declared by the corporation's Board of
Directors. The holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, for each share of
Series B Preferred Stock held by such holders, out of any funds legally available therefor,
noncumulative cash dividends at the rate of nine percent (9%) of the Original Issue Price (as defined
below) per annum (as adjusted for any recapitalizations, stock combinations, stock dividends, stock
splits and the like), when, as and if declared by the corporation's Board of Directors. The “Original
Issue Price” of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be twenty-five cents ($0.25) and the “Original
Issue Price” of the Series B Preferred Stock shall be [one dollar ($1.00)]. No dividend shall be paid
on the Common Stock in any year, other than dividends payable solely in capital stock, until all
dividends for such year have been declared and paid on the Preferred Stock, and no dividends on the
Common Stock shall be paid unless the amount of such dividend on the Common Stock is also paid
on the Preferred Stock on an as-converted to Common Stock basis.

Section 2, Liquidation Preference.

(a) In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation,
prior and in preference to any distribution of any of the assets or funds of the corporation to the
holders of the Common Stock and Series A Preferred Stock by reason of their ownership of such
stock, the holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive for each outstanding share
of Series B Preferred Stock then held by them an amount equal to [$1.00] plus declared but unpaid
dividends on such share (as adjusted for any recapitalizations, stock combinations, stock dividends,
stock splits and the like). If, upon the occurrence of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the

CWocuments and Settings\loW ocal Settings\Temporry Intemet Files\;OLK2B7\PALIB2_2719416_4 (2).DOC -2-
assets and funds of the corporation legally available for distribution to stockholders by reason of
their ownership of stock of the corporation shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such
holders of Series B Preferred Stock of the full aforementioned preferential amounts, then the entire
assets and funds of the corporation legally available for distribution to stockholders by reason of
their ownership of stock of the corporation shall be distributed ratably among the holders of Series B
Preferred Stock in proportion to the preferential amount each such holder is otherwise entitled to
receive,

(b) Upon a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, and after
payment to the holders of Series B Preferred Stock of the amounts to which they are entitled
pursuant to Section 2(a), prior and in preference to any distribution of any of the assets or funds of
the corporation to the holders of Common Stock by reason of their ownership of such stock, the
holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive for each outstanding share of Series A
Preferred Stock then held by them an amount equal to $0.25, plus declared but unpaid dividends on
such share (as adjusted for any recapitalizations, stock combinations, stock dividends, stock splits
and the like). If, upon the occurrence of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the assets and
funds of the corporation legally available for distribution to stockholders by reason of their
ownership of stock of the corporation shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of
Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock of the full aforementioned preferential
amounts, then such assets and funds will first be distributed to holders of Series B Preferred Stock in
satisfaction of the full preferential amount to which holders of Series B Preferred Stock are entitled.
Thereafter, any remaining assets and funds of the corporation legally available for distribution will
be distributed ratably among the holders of Series A Preferred Stock in proportion to the preferential
amount each such holder is otherwise entitled to receive.

(c) Upon a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, and after
payment to the holders Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock of the amounts to
which they are entitled pursuant to Sections 2(a) and 2(b), all assets and funds of the corporation that
remain legally available for distribution to stockholders by reason of their ownership of stock of the
corporation shall be distributed ratably among the holders of Common Stock and the holders of
Preferred Stock on an as-converted to Common Stock basis.

(d) For the purposes of this Section 2, a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of
the corporation shall be deemed to be occasioned by, and to include, the corporation's sale of all or
substantially all of its assets or the acquisition of this corporation by another entity by means of
merger or consolidation resulting in the exchange of the outstanding shares of this corporation for
securities or consideration issued, or caused to be issued, by the acquiring corporation or its
subsidiary, unless the stockholders of this corporation, as constituted immediately prior to such
transaction, hold at least 50% of the voting power of the surviving corporation in such a transaction.

(e) If any of the assets of this corporation are to be distributed under this Section
2, or for any other purpose, in the form of securities, then such securities shall be valued in good
faith by the Board of Directors which shall take into account such objective evidence of value (such
as market trading prices and the like) as is reasonably available to the Board of Directors at the time
of valuation.

(f) If any of the assets of this corporation are to be distributed under this Section
2, or for any other purpose, in a form other than cash or securities, then the Board of Directors shall

CADocuments and Settings\lo\ocal Settings\Temporary Intemet Files\OLK2B7\PALIB2_2719416_4 (2).DOC ~3-
be empowered to, and shall promptly determine the value of the assets to be distributed to the
holders of Preferred Stock or Common Stock. This corporation shall, upon receipt of such
determination, give prompt written notice of the determination to each holder of shares of Preferred
Stock or Common Stock.

Section 3. Conversion. The holders of Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as
follows: :

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the
option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share, at the office of the
corporation or any transfer agent for such Preferred Stock, into such number of fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing (i) the Original Issue Price of
such share of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, as applicable, by (ii) the
Conversion Price (the "Conversion Price") at the time in effect for a share of such series of Preferred
Stock. The Original Issue Price per share of Series A Preferred Stock is $0.25 (as adjusted for any
recapitalizations, stock combinations, stock dividends, stock splits and the like with respect to the
Series A Preferred Stock). The Original Issue Price per share of Series B Preferred Stock is [$1.00]
(as adjusted for any recapitalizations, stock combinations, stock dividends, stock splits and the like
with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock). The Conversion Price per share of Series A Preferred
Stock initially shall be $0.25, subject to adjustment from time to time as provided below, The
Conversion Price per share of Series B Preferred Stock initially shall be [$1.00], subject to
adjustment from time to time as provided below. All references herein to the Conversion Price with
respect to Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock shall mean the Conversion Price as
so adjusted.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be
converted into shares of Common Stock at the then effective Conversion Price upon the earlier of (i)
the closing of a firm commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration
statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, covering the offer and sale of Common
Stock to the public involving gross proceeds to the Company of not less than $30,000,000 (a
"Qualified Initial Public Offering") or (ii) the consent of holders of not less than a majority of the
then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock voting together as a single class and not as separate
series, and on an as-converted to Common Stock basis.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be
issued upon conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder
would otherwise be entitled, the corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the
then effective Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock. Before any holder of Preferred
Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 3(a),
such holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the
corporation or of any transfer agent for such Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice by mail,
postage prepaid, to the corporation at its principal corporate office, of the election to convert the
samc, and such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of
business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted. In the event
of an automatic conversion pursuant to Section 3(b), the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall
be converted automatically without any further action by the holder of such shares and whether or
not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the corporation or the transfer agent
for such Preferred Stock; and the corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing

C* Documents and Settings\loLocal Settings\Temporary Intemet Files\OLK2B7\PALIB2_2719416_4 (2).DOC -4-
the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such automatic conversion unless the certificates
evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are either delivered to the corporation or the transfer agent
for such Preferred Stock as provided above, or the holder notifies the corporation or the transfer
agent for such Preferred Stock that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes
an agreement satisfactory to the corporation or its transfer agent to indemnify the corporation and/or
its transfer agent from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates (and in the case of
a transfer agent, if so required, provides a bond in such amount reasonably satisfactory to such
transfer agent). The corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver to such
address as the holder may direct, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common
Stock to which such holder shall be entitled. If the conversion is in connection with a public
offering of securities described in Section 3(b), the conversion shall be conditioned upon the closing
with the underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering, and the conversion shall not
be deemed to have occurred until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities,

(d) Status of Converted Stock. In the event any shares of Preferred Stock shall
be converted pursuant to this Section 3, the shares so converted shall be canceled and shall not be
reissued by the corporation.

{e) Adjustment of Conversion Price of Preferred Stock. The Conversion Price
shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

(i) Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of Common Stock.
In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided by stock split, stock
dividend or otherwise, into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price of
each series of Preferred Stock then in effect shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such
subdivision, be proportionately decreased. In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock
shall be combined or consolidated into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion
Price of each series of Preferred Stock then in effect shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of
such combination or consolidation, be proportionately increased.

(ii) Adjustments for Stock Dividends and Other Distributions, In the
event the corporation makes, or fixes a record date for the determination of holders of Common
Stock entitled to receive, any distribution (excluding repurchases of securities by the corporation not
made on a pro rata basis) payable in property or in securities of the corporation other than shares of
Common Stock, and other than as otherwise adjusted for in this Section 3 or as provided for in
Section | in connection with a dividend, then and in each such event the holders of Preferred Stock
shall receive, at the time of such distribution, the amount of property or the number of securities of
the corporation that they would have received had their Preferred Stock been converted into
Common Stock on the date of such event.

(iii) Adjustments for Reorganizations, Reclassifications or Similar
Events. [f the Common Stock shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of any
other class or classes of stock or other securities or property, whether by capital reorganization,
reclassification or otherwise, then each share of Preferred Stock shall thereafter be convertible into
the number of shares of stock or other securities or property to which a holder of the number of
shares of Common Stock of the corporation deliverable upon conversion of such shares of Preferred
Stock shall have been entitled upon such reorganization, reclassification or other event.

(C) Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock.

i) in the case of Convertible Securities or Options
for Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common Stock issued were shares of Common
Stock, if any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of
such Convertible Securities, and the consideration received therefor was the consideration actually
received by the corporation for the issue of all such Options, whether or not exercised, plus the
consideration actually received by the corporation upon such exercise, or for the issue of all such
Convertible Securities, whether or not converted or exchanged, plus the additional consideration, if
any, actually received by the corporation upon such conversion or exchange; and

ii) in the case of Options for Convertible
Securities, only the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were
issued at the time of issue of such Options and the consideration received by the corporation for the
Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been then issued was the consideration actually
received by the corporation for the issue of all such Options, whether or not exercised, plus the
consideration deemed to have been received by the corporation upon the issue of the Convertible
Securities with respect to which such Options were actually exercised;

(4) no readjustment pursuant to Section 3(e)(iv)(C)(2) or
(3) above shall have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price to an amount which exceeds the
Conversion Price existing immediately prior to the original adjustment with respect to the issuance
of such Options or Convertible Securities, as adjusted for any Additional Shares of Common Stock
issued (or, pursuant to Section 3(e)(iv)(C), deemed to be issued) between such original adjustment
date and such readjustment date;

(5) inthe case of any Options which expire by their terms
not more than 30 days after the date of issue thereof, no adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be

conversion or exchange thereof is not determinable, adjustment of the Conversion Price shall only be
made with respect to the number actually determinable and no adjustment to the Conversion Price
shall be made with respect to the number undeterminable until such undeterminable number
becomes determinable.

(D) Adjustment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of
Additional Shares of Common Stock. Subject to the limitation set forth in Section 3(¢)(iv)(B),
above, if Additional Shares of Common Stock are issued (or, pursuant to Section 3(e)(iv)(C),
deemed to be issued) without consideration or for a consideration per share (computed on an as-
converted to Common Stock basis) less than a Conversion Price in effect on the date of, and
immediately prior to, such issue (a "Dilutive Issue"), then and in such event, such Conversion Price
shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest cent) determined
by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, (x) the numerator of which shall be the number
of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of shares of
Common Stock which the aggregate consideration received by the corporation for the total number
of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued would purchase at such Conversion Price, and (y)
the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to such issue plus the number of such Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued. For the

CaDocuments and Settings\lo\Local Settings\Temporary Intemet Files\O1.K2B7\PALIB2_271941 6_4 (2).DOC -8-
purposes of this Section 3(e)(iv)(D), all shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
outstanding Options and upon conversion of outstanding Convertible Securities and Preferred Stock,
shall be deemed to be outstanding, and immediately after any Additional Shares of Common Stock
are deemed issued pursuant to Section 3(e){iv)(C), such Additional Shares of Common Stock shall
be deemed to be outstanding.

(E) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this
Section 3(e)(iv), the consideration received by the corporation for any Additional Shares of Common
Stock issued (or, pursuant to Section 3(e)(iv)(C), deemed to be issued) shall be computed as follows:

(1) Cash and Property. Such consideration shall:

i) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
aggregate amount of cash received by the corporation after deducting any commissions paid by the
corporation with respect to such issuance;

ii) insofar as it consists of property other than cash,
be computed at the fair value thereof at the time of such issuance, as determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors of the corporation; and

ili) if Additional Shares of Common Stock are
issued (or, pursuant to Section 3(e)(iv)(C), deemed to be issued) together with other shares or
securities or other assets of the corporation for consideration which covers both, be the proportion of
such consideration so received, computed as provided in clauses (i) and (11) of this Section
3(e)(iv)(E)(1), as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the corporation.

{2) Options and Convertible Securities. The
consideration received by the corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have
been issued pursuant to Section 3(e)(iv)(C), relating to Options and Convertible Securities, shall be
the sum of (x) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the corporation as consideration for
the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus (y) the minimum aggregate amount of
additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto but without taking into
account potential antidilution adjustments) payable to the corporation upon the exercise of such
Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for
Convertible Securities (without achievement of any milestones other than the passage of time), the
exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities.

(f) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 3, the corporation at its expense shall
promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish
to each holder of Preferred Stock to which such adjustment pertains a certificate setting forth such
adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or
readjustment is based. The corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of
Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth () such
adjustments and readjustments, (ii) the Conversion Price at the time in effect, and (iii) the number of
shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be

(g) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The corporation shall at
all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock,
solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock, such number
of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock, in addition to such other remedies as shall be available to the holder of
such Preferred Stock, the corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its
counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such
number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including, without limitation, using
reasonable efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to this
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

Section 4, Voting.

(a) General. Except as otherwise required by law, each holder of Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of shares of Common Stock into which
the shares of Preferred Stock so held could be converted at the record date for determination of the
stockholders entitled to vote, or, ifno such record date is established, at the date such vote is taken or
any written consent of stockholders is solicited. Except as required by law or as otherwise set forth
herein (including without limitation Sections 4(b) and 4(c)), all shares of all series of Preferred Stock
and all shares of Common Stock shall vote together as a single class. Fractional votes by the holders
of Preferred Stock shall not, however, be permitted, and any fractional voting rights shall (after
aggregating all shares into which shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder could be converted)
be rounded down to the nearest whole number.

{b) Election of Directors. The authorized number of directors of the corporation
shall be set forth in the Bylaws of the corporation and may be increased or decreased in accordance
with their provisions. For so long as at least 300,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock remain
