The Preferred Stock will be issued in series. The first series of Preferred Stock shall be
comprised of three million five hundred ninety-eight thousand seven hundred ninety (3,598,790)
shares and shall be designated “Series A-1 Preferred Stock.” As used herein, the term ‘Series
A-I Preferred Stock” without designation shall refer to shares of the Corporation’s Series A-1
Preferred Stock. The second series of Preferred Stock shall be comprised of three million four
hundred thousand (3,400,000) shares and shall be designated “Series A-2 Preferred Stock.” As

the Corporation’s Series A-2 Preferred Stock. The third series of Preferred Stock shall be
comprised of three million four hundred thousand (3,400,000) shares and shall be designated
“Series A-3 Preferred Stock.” As used herein, the term “Series A-3 Preferred Stock” without
designation shall refer to shares of the Corporation’s Series A-3 Preferred Stock.

Subject to compliance with applicable voting rights which may have been or may be
granted hereunder to the holders of Preferred Stock or series thereof, including, without
limitation, Article IV(B), Section 6 hereof (the “Protective Provisions’), the Preferred Stock
authorized by this Certificate of Incorporation may be issued from time to time in one or more
series. Subject to compliance with the applicable Protective Provisions, the Board of Directors is
expressly authorized to increase or decrease (but not below the number of shares of such series
then outstanding) the number of shares of any series prior to or subsequent to the issue of shares
in that series. In case the number of shares of any such series shall be so decreased, the shares
constituting such decrease shall resume the status that they had prior to the adoption of the
resolution originally fixing the number of shares of such series.

B. Rights, Preferences, Privileges and Restrictions of Preferred. The relative
rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to or imposed upon the Preferred Stock
are as follows:

1. Dividends. The holders of the then outstanding Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to receive dividends out of any assets legally available therefor. prior and in preference
to any declaration or payments of any dividend (payable other than in Common Stock or other
securities and rights convertible into or entitling the holder thereof to receive, directly or
indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock of this Corporation) on the Common Stock of this
Corporation, at the rate of $0.3608 per share per annum for the Series A-1 Preferred Stock (as
adjusted for any consolidations, combinations, stock distributions, stock dividends, stock splits
or similar events, each a “‘Recapitalization Event’) and $0.3616 per share per annum for the
Series A-2 Preferred Stock and Series A-3 Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any Recapitalization
Event), payable when, as, and if declared by the Board of Directors; provided, however that no
stockholder of the Corporation shall be entitled to receive any dividends as a result of (a) the
Corporation’s repurchase of certain shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any
Recapitalization Event) at a price per share not to exceed $4.51 (as adjusted for any
Recapitalization Event) effected pursuant to the terms and conditions of agreements between the
Corporation and each of certain stockholders of the Corporation dated on or about the date on
which the Series A-2 Preferred Stock was first issued by the Corporation (the “Prior Exempt
Recapitalization Event’), or (b) the exchange of shares of Series A-2 Preferred Stock for shares
of Series A-3 Preferred Stock to be effected (if elected by the holders of the then outstanding
shares of Series A-2 Preferred Stock) between the date of the filing of this Certificate of
Incorporation and the closing of a Corporate Sale (as defined Article [V(B), Section 2(c)) to be
consummated in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement (as defined in Article
IV(B), Section S(a)) (the “Planned Exempt Recapitalization Event’). No dividend may be
declared or paid on any shares of Common Stock unless at the same time an equivalent dividend
is declared and paid simultaneously on the Preferred Stock on an as-converted basis. The right
to dividends on shares of the Common Stock and Preferred Stock shall not be cumulative, and no
right shall accrue to holders of Common Stock or Preferred Stock by reason of the fact that
dividends on said shares are not declared in any period nor shall any undeclared or unpaid
dividend bear or accrue interest.

2. Liquidation Preference. In the event of the liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation, either voluntary or involuntary, distributions to the stockholders
of the Corporation shall be made in the following manner:

(a) Preference. The holders of Series A-2 Preferred Stock and Series
A-3 Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, on a pari passu basis, prior and in preference to
any distribution of any assets or property of the Corporation to the holders of Series A-1
Preferred Stock and Common Stock by reason of their ownership hereof, an amount per share
equal to the Original Series A-2 Price or the Original Series A-3 Price, as applicable (as defined
in Article [V(B), Section 5(a) below) (as adjusted for any Recapitalization Event) plus an amount
equal to all declared and unpaid dividends with respect thereto; provided, however that no
stockholder of the Corporation shall be entitled to receive any dividends as a result of the Prior
Exempt Recapitalization Event or the Planned Exempt Recapitalization Event. If upon the
occurrence of such event, the assets and funds available for distribution are insufficient to permit
the payment to the holders of Series A-2 Preferred Stock and Series A-3 Preferred Stock of their
full preferential amount, then the entire assets and funds of the Corporation legally available for
distribution to stockholders will be distributed among the holders of the Series A-2 Preferred
Stock and Series A-3 Preferred Stock ratably in proportion to the full preferential amount which
they would be entitled to receive pursuant to the preceding sentence of this Article IV(B),
Section 2(a). After payment has been made in full to the holders of Series A-2 Preferred Stock
and Series A-3 Preferred Stock pursuant to the first sentence of this Article IV(B), Section 2(a),
the holders of Series A-1 Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive prior and in preference to
any distribution of any assets or property of the Corporation to the holders of Common Stock by
reason of their ownership hereof, an amount per share equal to the Original Series A-1 Price (as
defined in Article IV(B), Section 5(a) below) (as adjusted for any Recapitalization Event) plus an
amount equal to all declared and unpaid dividends with respect thereto; provided, however that
no stockholder of the Corporation shall be entitled to receive any dividends as a result of the
Prior Exempt Recapitalization Event or the Planned Exempt Recapitalization Event. If upon the
occurrence of such event, the assets and funds available for distribution are insufficient to permit
the payment to the holders of Series A-1 Preferred Stock of their full preferential amount, then
the entire assets and funds of the Corporation legally available for distribution to stockholders,
after the payment to the holders of Series A-2 Preferred Stock and Series A-3 Preferred Stock of
their full preferential amount, will be distributed among the holders of the Series A-1 Preferred
Stock ratably in proportion to the full preferential amount which they would be entitled to
receive pursuant to the preceding sentence of this Article IV(B), Section 2(a).

(b) Remaining Assets. After payment has been made in full to the
holders of Preferred Stock pursuant to Article IV(B), Section 2(a), the holders of Common Stock
shall be entitled to receive the remaining funds and assets of the Corporation available for
distribution to stockholders ratably in proportion to the shares of Common Stock then held by
them; provided, however that no stockholder of the Corporation shall be entitled to receive any
dividends as a result of the Prior Exempt Recapitalization Event or the Planned Exempt
Recapitalization Event.

(c) Reorganization or Merger. The following events shall be
considered a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of this Corporation within the meaning of this
Article IV(B), Section 2 (each a “Corporate Sale’): (1) a reorganization, merger or consolidation
of the Corporation with or into any other corporation or corporations, in which the stockholders
of the Corporation immediately prior to the transaction hold 50% or less of the voting stock
immediately after the transaction, (ii) a sale, transfer, exclusive license, lease or other disposition
(but not including a transfer by pledge or mortgage to a bona fide lender) of all or substantially
all of the assets of the Corporation (other than to a wholly-owned subsidiary) or (iii) any
transaction or series of related transactions to which the Corporation is a party in which the
stockholders of the Corporation immediately prior to the transaction hold 50% or less of the
voting stock immediately after the transaction; provided, however, that a transaction shall not
constitute a Corporate Sale if its sole purpose is to change the state of this Corporation’s
incorporation or to create a holding company that will be owned in substantially the same
proportions by the persons who held this Corporation’s securities immediately prior to such
transaction.

(d) Non-Cash Distributions. The value of assets or securities
distributed pursuant to this Article IV(B), Section 2 shall be computed at their fair market value
at the time distributed to stockholders, as determined by the Board of Directors in the good faith
exercise of its reasonable business judgment, provided that (i) if such securities are listed on any
established stock exchange or a national market system, their fair market value shall be deemed
to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange or system over the
thirty (30) day period (or portion thereof) ending three (3) days prior to the closing, as reported
in the Wall Street Journal or similar publication, (ii) if such securities are regularly quoted by a
recognized securities dealer but selling prices are not reported, their fair market value shall be the
average high bid and low asked prices for such securities over the thirty (30) day period (or
portion thereof) ending three (3) days prior to the closing; and (iii) if such assets or securities are
not publicly traded, their fair market value shall be as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors of the Corporation.

(e) Consent for Certain Repurchases. Each holder of an outstanding
share of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have consented, for purposes of Sections 502 and
503 of the General Corporation Law of California (the “CGCL”), to distributions made by the
Corporation in connection with (i) the Prior Exempt Recapitalization Event, (ii) the Planned
Exempt Recapitalization Event, and (ii) the repurchase of shares of Common Stock issued to or
held by directors, employees or consultants (1) upon termination of their employment or services
pursuant to agreements providing for the right of said repurchase at cost or (2) in connection with
the exercise by the Corporation of contractual rights of first refusal or first offer pursuant to
agreements providing for the right of said repurchase between the Corporation and such persons,
provided the terms of such repurchase shall have been approved by the Board of Directors.
3. Voting Rights.

(a) General Rights. The holder of each share of Preferred Stock shall
be entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of shares of Common Stock into which
such share of Preferred Stock could be converted on the record date for the vote or written
consent of stockholders and, except as otherwise required by law or as set forth herein, shall have
voting rights and powers equal to the voting rights and powers of the Common Stock. The
holder of each share of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to notice of any stockholders’ meeting in
accordance with the bylaws of the Corporation and shall vote with holders of the Common Stock

Stock held by each holder could be converted) shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number.

Each holder of Common Stock shall be entitled to one (1) vote for each share of Common Stock
held.

(b) Election of Board of Directors. As long as at least an aggregate

removal of such director. The holders of outstanding Common Stock, voting as a separate class,
shall be entitled to elect three (3) directors of this Corporation at each meeting or pursuant to
each consent of the Corporation’s stockholders for the election of directors, and to remove from
office such directors and to fill any vacancy caused by the resignation, death or removal of such

separate class, the Common Stock voting as a single class, or the Common Stock and Preferred
Stock voting together as a single class, or any director so elected as provided in the preceding
sentence hereof, may be removed during the aforesaid term of office, whether with or without
cause, only by the affirmative vote of the holders of the Series A-2 Preferred Stock and Series A-

rights as follows (the “Conversion Rights’):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be
convertible without the payment of any additional consideration by the holder thereof and, at the
option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share at the office of
the Corporation or any transfer agent of the Corporation for the Preferred Stock. Each share of
Series A-1 Preferred Stock shall be convertible at the conversion rate determined by dividing the
Original Series A-1 Price by the Series A-1 Conversion Price (determined as provided herein) in
effect at the time of conversion. The “Original Series A-J Price’ shall be $4.51 and the initial
“Series A-1 Conversion Price” shall be $4.51. Each share of Series A-2 Preferred Stock shail be

The “Original Series A-2 Price” shall be $4.52 and the initial “Series A-2 Conversion Price”
shall be $4.52. Each share of Series A-3 Preferred Stock shall be convertible at the conversion
rate determined by dividing the Original Series A-3 Price by the Series A-3 Conversion Price
(determined as provided herein) in effect at the time of conversion. The “Original Series A-3
Price” shall be $4.52 and the initial “Series 4-3 Conversion Price” shall be $4.52; provided that
if, and only if, the automatic conversion set forth in the first sentence of Article IV(B), Section
5(b) below is effected in connection with the closing of a Corporate Sale pursuant to the terms of
that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated March 12, 2008 (as the same may be amended
or modified from time to time, the “Merger Agreement’), to which the Corporation is a party,
then the Series A-3 Conversion Price applicable to such conversion shall be
$4.19382080374508. Each of the Original Series A-1 Price, Original Series A-2 Price and
Original Series A-3 Price is herein referred to as the “Original Price.’ Each of the Series A-1
Conversion Price, Series A-2 Conversion Price and Series A-3 Conversion Price is herein
referred to as a “Conversion Price”. The number of shares of Common Stock into which each
share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series A-2 Preferred Stock and Series A-3 Preferred Stock
respectively, may be converted is hereinafter referred to as the “Preferred Stock Conversion
Rate” of the Series A-] Preferred Stock, Series A-2 Preferred Stock and Series A-3 Preferred
Stock respectively. Each Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in
Article III, Section 5(c) below.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Series A-3 Preferred Stock
shall automatically be converted into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Common Stock at its then effective Preferred Stock Conversion Rate immediately prior to the
closing of a Corporate Sale pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. In addition, each
share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series A-2 Preferred Stock and Series A-3 Preferred Stock
shall automatically be converted into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Common Stock at the then effective Preferred Stock Conversion Rate, as applicable,
immediately upon the earlier of:
(i) the written consent of the holders of more than fifty percent
(50%) of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class on an
as-converted-basis; or

per share (prior to underwriters’ commissions and expenses) of not less than five (5) times the
Original Series A-2 Price (as adjusted for Recapitalization Events) with aggregate gross proceeds
to the Corporation of not less than $30,000.000 (a “Qualified Public Offering’).

respectively, in effect on the date of, and immediately prior to, such issue.

(iii) | Deemed Issue of Additional] Shares of Common Stock or
Additional Shares of Incentive Stock. In the event the Corporation at any time or from time to
time after the effective date of this Certificate of Incorporation shall issue any Options or
Convertible Securities or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of
securities entitled to receive any such Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum
number of shares (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto without regard to any provisions
contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) of Common Stock issuable upon
the exercise of such Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities, the conversion or exchange
of the Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to be Additional Shares of Common Stock or
Additional Shares of Incentive Stock, as applicable, issued as of the time of the issuance of such
Option or Convertible Security or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the
close of business on such record date:

(A) except as provided in Article TV(B), Section

upon the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities or shares of Common Stock upon the
exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities;

terms provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any change in the consideration payable
to the Corporation, or change in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable, upon the
exercise, conversion or exchange thereof (other than under or by reason of provisions designed
to protect against dilution), a Conversion Price computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon
the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto) and any subsequent adjustments based
thereon, shall, upon any such increase or decrease becoming effective, be recomputed to reflect
such increase or decrease insofar as it affects such Options or the rights of conversion or
exchange under such Convertible Securities;

(C) upon the expiration of any such Options or
Convertible Securities, each Conversion Price, to the extent in any way affected by or computed
using such Options or Convertible Securities, shall be recomputed to reflect the issuance of only
the number of shares of Common Stock actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or
Convertible Securities; and

(D) (1) no readjustment pursuant to Article IV(B),
Section 5(c)(iii) clauses (B) and (C) above shall have the effect of increasing the Series A-1
Conversion Price to an amount that exceeds the Series A-1 Conversion Price on the original
adjustment date, (2) no readjustment pursuant to Article IV(B), Section 5(c)(iii) clauses (B) and
(C) above shall have the effect of increasing Series A-2 Conversion Price to an amount which
exceeds the lower of (a) the Series A-2 Conversion Price on the original adjustment date or (b)
the Series A-2 Conversion Price that would have resulted from any issuance of Additional Shares
of Common Stock or Additional Shares of Incentive Stock between the original adjustment date
and such readjustment date, and (3) no readjustment pursuant to Article IV(B), Section 5(c)(iii)
clauses (B) and (C) above shall have the effect of increasing Series A-3 Conversion Price to an
amount which exceeds the lower of (a) the Series A-3 Conversion Price on the original
adjustment date or (b) the Series A-3 Conversion Price that would have resulted from any
issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock or Additional Shares of Incentive Stock
between the original adjustment date and such readjustment date.

(iv) Adjustment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of
Additional Shares of Common Stock Below Purchase Price. In the event this Corporation
shall issue Additional Shares of Common Stock (including Additional Shares of Common Stock
deemed to be issued pursuant to Article IV(B), Section 5(c)(iii)), after the effective date of this
Certificate of Incorporation, without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the
Series A-2 Conversion Price or the Series A-3 Conversion Price in effect on the date of and
immediately prior to such issue, then and in each such event the Series A-2 Conversion Price or
the Series A-3 Conversion Price, respectively, shall automatically be adjusted as set forth in this
Article IV(B), Section 5(c)(iv), unless otherwise provided in this Article IV(B), Section 5(c).

(A) Adjustment of Series A-2 Conversion Price and
Series A-3 Conversion Price. Whenever the Series A-2 Conversion Price or Series A-3
Conversion Price is adjusted by Article IV(B), Section 5(c)(iv), the new Series A-2 Conversion
Price or Series A-3 Conversion Price, respectively, shall be determined by multiplying the
applicable Series A-2 Conversion Price or Series A-3 Conversion Price then in effect by a
fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to such issue plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate
consideration received by the Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of Common
Stock so issued would purchase at such applicable Series A-2 Conversion Price or Series A-3
Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance, and the denominator of which
shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus
the number of such Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued. For the purposes of this
paragraph, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be deemed to include the

9
Common Stock issuable on conversion of all outstanding Preferred Stock other than the
Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued, upon conversion or exercise of any outstanding
Convertible Securities other than the Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued, and upon
exercise of all outstanding Options other than the Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued
(and assuming conversion of Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of such Options).

(Vv) Adjustment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of
Additional Shares of Incentive Stock. In the event this Corporation shall issue Additional
Shares of Incentive Stock (including Additional Shares of Incentive Stock deemed to be issued
pursuant to Article IV(B), Section 5(c)(iii)) after the effective date of this Certificate of
Incorporation then and in each such event the Series A-2 Conversion Price and the Series A-3
Conversion Price shall automatically be adjusted to a new Series A-2 Conversion Price and new
Series A-3 Conversion Price, such that the applicable Post-Issuance Percentage (as defined
below) is equal to the applicable Pre-Issuance Percentage (as defined below), unless otherwise
provided in this Article IV(B), Section 5({c). For purposes of this paragraph, (a) the “Post-
Issuance Percentage” is equal to a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of
shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all shares of Series A-2 Preferred Stock or
Series A-3 Preferred Stock, as applicable, outstanding immediately following the issuance (or
deemed issuance) of such Additional Shares of Incentive Stock after giving effect to the
adjustments under this paragraph, and the denominator of which shall be the sum of the number
of Additional Shares of Incentive Stock so issued (or deemed issued) and the number of
outstanding shares of Common Stock immediately following the issuance (or deemed issuance)
of such Additional Shares of Incentive Stock after giving effect to the adjustments under this
paragraph, (b) the “Pre-Issuance Percentage” is equal to a fraction, the numerator of which shall
be the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all shares of Series A-2
Preferred Stock or Series A-3 Preferred Stock, as applicable, outstanding immediately prior to,
and without giving effect to any adjustment that otherwise would be effected by this paragraph
as a result of, such issuance (or deemed issuance) of such Additional Shares of Incentive Stock,
and the denominator of which shall be the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock
immediately prior to, and without giving effect to any adjustment that otherwise would be
effected by this paragraph as a result of, the issuance (or deemed issuance) of such Additional
Shares of Incentive Stock, and (c) the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be
deemed to include the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all outstanding Preferred
Stock other than the Additional Shares of Incentive Stock so issued, upon conversion or exercise
of any outstanding Convertible Securities other than the Additional Shares of Incentive Stock so
issued, and upon exercise of all outstanding Options other than the Additional Shares of
Incentive Stock so issued (and assuming conversion of Convertible Securities issuable upon
exercise of such Options).

(vi) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this
Article IV(B), Section 5(c), the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any
Additional Shares of Common Stock or Additional Shares of Incentive Stock, as applicable, shall
be computed as follows:

(A) Cash and Property: Such consideration shall:

10
(1) _ insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at
the aggregate amount of cash received by the Corporation before deducting any reasonable
discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the Corporation for any
underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof;

(2) insofar as it consists of property other than
cash, be computed at the fair value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined by Board of
Directors in the good faith exercise of its reasonable business judgment; and

(3) in the event Additional Shares of Common
Stock or Additional Shares of Incentive Stock are issued together with other shares or securities
or other assets of the Corporation for consideration which covers both, be the proportion of such
consideration so received, computed as provided in clauses (1) and (2) above, as determined in
good faith by the Board.

(B) Options and Convertible Securities. The
consideration per share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock or
Additional Shares of Incentive Stock deemed to have been issued pursuant to Article IV(B),
Section 5(c), relating to Options and Convertible Securities, shall be determined by dividing:

(1) the total amount, if any, received or
receivable by the Corporation as consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible
Securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the
instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent
adjustment of such consideration) payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such Options
or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for
Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities and the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, by

(2) the maximum number of shares of Common
Stock (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained
therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options
or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities.

(vii) Other Adjustments to Conversion Price.

(A) Subdivisions, Combinations, or Consolidations
of Common Stock. If at any time and from time to time the outstanding shares of Common
Stock shall be subdivided, combined or consolidated, by stock split, stock dividend, combination
or like event, into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock after the effective date
of this Certificate of Incorporation, each Conversion Price in effect immediately pnor to such
subdivision, combination, consolidation or stock dividend shall, concurrently with the
effectiveness of such subdivision, combination or consolidation, be proportionately adjusted.

(B) Distributions Other Than Cash Dividends Out of
Retained Earnings. In case the Corporation shall declare a cash dividend upon its Common
Stock payable otherwise than out of retained earnings or shall distribute to holders of its

11
Common Stock shares of its capital stock (other than shares of Common Stock and other than as
otherwise adjusted in this Article IV(B), Section 5(c)), stock or other securities of other persons,
evidences of indebtedness issued by the Corporation or other persons, assets (excluding cash
dividends) or options or rights (excluding options to purchase and rights to subscribe for
Common Stock or other securities of the Corporation convertible into or exchangeable for
Common Stock), then, in each such case, provision shall be made so that the holders of
Preferred Stock shall receive upon conversion thereof, in addition to the number of shares of
Common Stock receivable thereupon, the amount of securities of the Corporation which they
would have received had their Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock on the date of
such event and had they thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to and including
the date of conversion, retained such securities receivable by them as aforesaid during such
period, subject to all other adjustments called for during such period under this Article IV(B),
Section 5 with respect to the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock.

(C) Adjustment for Common Stock Dividends and
Distributions. If, after the effective date of this Certificate of Incorporation, the Corporation at
any time or from time to time makes, or fixes a record date for determination of holders of
Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares
of Common Stock, in each such event each Conversion Price that is then in effect shall be
decreased as of the time of such issuance or, in the event such record date is fixed, as of the close
of business on such record date, by multiplying each Conversion Price then in effect by a
fraction of (i) the numerator of which is the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of business on such
record date, and (ii) the denominator of which is the total number of shares of Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of business on
such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such
dividend or distribution; provided, however, that if such record date is fixed and such dividend is
not fully paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, each Conversion
Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record date and
thereafter each Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this Article IV(B), Section
5(c)(vii)(C) to reflect the actual payment of such dividend or distribution.

(D)  Reclassifications and Reorganizations. In the
case, at any time after the date hereof, of any capital reorganization (except as provided in
Article IV(B), Section 2(d)) or any reclassification of the stock of the Corporation (other than as
a result of a stock dividend or subdivision, split-up or combination of shares), each Conversion
Price then in effect shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such reorganization or
reclassification, be proportionately adjusted such that the shares of the Preferred Stock shall,
after such reorganization or reclassification, be convertible into the kind and number of shares of
stock or other securities or property of the Corporation or otherwise to which such holder would
have been entitled if immediately prior to such reorganization or reclassification, the holder had
converted the holder’s shares of the Preferred Stock into Common Stock. The provisions of this
Article IV(B), Section 5(c)(vii)(D) shall similarly apply to successive reorganizations,
reclassifications, consolidations or Corporate Sales.

(d) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each
adjustment or readjustment of the any Conversion Price pursuant to this Article [V(B), Section 5,

12
the Corporation at its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in
accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate
setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such
adjustment or readjustment is based including the consideration received for any Additional
Shares of Common Stock or Additional Shares of Incentive Stock issued. The Corporation shall,
upon the written request at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be
furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and readjustments,
(ii) the Conversion Price at the time in effect and (iii) the number of shares of Common Stock
and the type and amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon the
conversion of the Preferred Stock.

(e) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender
the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the headquarters of the Corporation or of
any transfer agent for the Corporation and shall give written notice to the Corporation at such
office that the holder elects to convert the same and shall state therein the name or names in
which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued (except that no
such written notice of election to convert shall be necessary in the event of an automatic
conversion pursuant to Article IV(B), Section 5(b) hereof). The Corporation shall, as soon as
practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to the
nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of
Common Stock to which he shall be entitled as aforesaid. Such conversion shall be deemed to
have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the
shares of Preferred Stock to be converted (except that in the case of an automatic conversion
pursuant to Article IV(B), Section 5(b) hereof such conversion shall be deemed to have been
made immediately prior to the closing of the offering referred to in Article IV(B), Section 5(b))
and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such
conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of
Common Stock on such date. Upon the occurrence of either of the events specified in Article
IV(B), Section 5(b) above, the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted
automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the
certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent;
provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion unless the certificates evidencing such
shares of Preferred Stock are either delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent as provided
above, or the holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been
lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify
the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates.

(f) Fractional Shares.

(i) In the event of the conversion of shares of Preferred Stock
in connection with the closing of a Corporate Sale pursuant to the terms of the Merger
Agreement, fractional shares of Common Stock may be issued upon such conversion.

(ii) | Other than as set forth in Article IV(B), Section 5(f)(i)
above, no fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of shares of

13
Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder of Preferred Stock would
otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shal! pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair
market value of one share of Common Stock as determined by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation. The number of whole shares issuable to each holder upon such conversion shall be
determined on the basis of the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of
the total number of shares of Preferred Stock of each holder at the time converting into Common
Stock.

(g) No Dilution or Impairment. Without the consent of the Preferred
Stock in accordance with Article ITV(B), Section 6, the Corporation will not amend this
Certificate of Incorporation or participate in any reorganization, recapitalization, transfer of
assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary
action, for the purpose of avoiding or secking to avoid the observance or performance of any of
the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Corporation, but will at all times in good
faith assist in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect
the conversion rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock against dilution or other impairment.

(h) Status of Converted Shares. No shares of Preferred Stock which
have been converted into Common Stock pursuant to Article [V(B), Section 5 hereof, after the
origina] issuance thereof shall ever again be reissued and all such shares so converted shall upon
such conversion be appropriately canceled on the books of the Corporation and shall be restored
to the status of authorized but unissued Preferred Stock of the Corporation, undesignated as to
series.

(i) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The
Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares
of Common Stock solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of Preferred
Stock such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to
effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number
of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such
corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but
unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such
purpose.

(Gj) Notices of Record Date. In the event of any taking by the
Corporation of a record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining
the holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend) or other
distribution, any right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of stock of any
class or any other securities or property or to receive any other right, the Corporation shall mail
to each holder of Preferred Stock at least ten (10) days prior to such record date, a notice
specifying the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend or
distribution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right.

6. Protective Provisions. In addition to any other rights provided by law, as

long as a majority of the authorized shares of the Preferred Stock remain outstanding, this
Corporation shall not (whether by merger, amendment, consolidation or otherwise), without first

14
obtaining the affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class on an as-converted basis:

(a) change the authorized number of directors on the Corporation’s
Board of Directors;

(b) make any amendment or waiver of this Corporation’s Certificate of

Incorporation or Bylaws that adversely changes the rights, preferences or privileges of the
Preferred Stock or any series thereof:

(c) increase the authorized number of, or issue, any securities
(including any security convertible into or exercisable for any equity security) on parity with or
senior any series of the Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, voting, conversion, redemption
or liquidation preference, including without limitation, the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series A-
2 Preferred Stock or Series A-3 Preferred Stock;

(d) | consummate or agree to consummate a Corporate Sale; except that
no approval of the Preferred Stock shall be necessary if the closing of such transaction results in
the distribution of assets to the holders of the Series A-2 Preferred Stock and Series A-3
Preferred Stock (or the Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof) pursuant to Article
IV(B), Section 2 hereof, by reason of such holders’ ownership thereof, in an amount per share
equal to or greater than nine (9) times the Original Series A-2 Price (as adjusted for
Recapitalization Events); and

(e) enter into any transaction or agreement between the Corporation
and Michael Birch, Xochi Birch, the Corporation’s executive officers or their affiliates or
respective family members (except in the ordinary course of business as part of travel advances

effective date of this Certificate of Incorporation.

and imposed on the Common Stock are as set forth below in this Article IV(C).

stock at the time outstanding having prior rights as to dividends, the holders of the Common

and in such manner as may be provided by law or as set forth in this Certificate of Incorporation.

15
The number of authorized shares of Common Stock may be increased or decreased (but not
