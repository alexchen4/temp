Distribution. Shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred

into voting securities of the surviving entity), as a result of shares in the Corporation held by such
holders prior to such transaction, at least fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power represented by
the voting securities of the Corporation or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such
transaction or series of transactions, (2) any equity financing primarily for capital raising purposes,

Corporation.

(g) | Maluation of Non-Cash Consideration. If any assets of the Corporation
distributed to stockholders in connection with any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the
Corporation are other than cash, then the value of such assets shall be their fair market value as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, except that any publicly-traded securities to be
distributed to stockholders in a liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation shall be
valued as follows:

(i) If the securities are then traded on a national securities exchange or the
Nasdaq Stock Market (or a similar national quotation system), then the value of the securities shall
be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange or system over
the ten (10) trading day period ending five (5) trading days prior to the Distribution:

(ii) If the securities are actively traded over-the-counter, then the value of
the securities shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid prices of the securities over the ten
(10) trading day period ending five (5) trading days prior to the Distribution.

In the event of a merger or other acquisition of the Corporation by another entity, the

Distribution date for purposes of these valuation provisions shall be deemed to be the date such
transaction closes.

SE\9101417.6 -6-
For the purposes of this Section 3(g), “trading day” shall mean any day which the exchange
or system on which the securities to be distributed are traded is open and “closing prices” or
“closing bid prices” shall be deemed to be: (i) for securities traded primarily on the New York
Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, the last reported trade price or sale price,
as the case may be, at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on that day and (ii) for securities listed or traded on
other exchanges, markets and systems, the market price as of the end of the regular hours trading
period that is generally accepted as such for such exchange, market or system. If, after the date
hereof, the Board of Directors determines that the benchmark times generally accepted in the
securities industry for determining the market price of a stock as of a given trading day shall change
from those set forth above, the fair market value shall be determined as of such other generally
accepted benchmark times.

4. Conversion. The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and
Series C Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred
Stock and Series C Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any
time after the date of issuance of such share at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for
the Preferred Stock, into that number of fully-paid, nonassessable shares of Common Stock
determined by dividing the Original Issue Price for the relevant series of Preferred Stock by the
applicable Conversion Price for such series. (The number of shares of Common Stock into which
each share of Preferred Stock of a series may be converted is hereinafter referred to as the
“Conversion Rate” for each such serics.) The Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment as set
forth in this Section 4. Upon any decrease or increase in the Conversion Price for any series of
Preferred Stock, as described in this Section 4, the Conversion Rate for such series shall be
appropriately increased or decreased.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock shall automatically-be converted into fully-paid, non-
assessable shares of Common Stock at the then effective Conversion Rate for such share
(i) immediately prior to the closing of a firm commitment underwritten initial public offering
pursuant to an effective registration statement filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the “Securities Act’), covering the offer and sale of the Corporation’s Common Stock, in
which the public offering price in such offering is not less than $6.98 per share (as adjusted for
Recapitalizations), and the aggregate gross proceeds to the Corporation are not less than $30,000,000
(a “Qualified IPO”), or (ii) upon the receipt by the Corporation of a written request for such
conversion from the holders of not less than two-thirds (2/3) of the Preferred Stock then
outstanding, counted together as a single class on an as-converted to Common Stock basis, or, if
later, the effective date for conversion specified in such request (each of the events referred to in (i)
and (11) are referred to herein as an “Automatic Conversion Event’).

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of Common Stock shal! be issued
upon conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would
otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shal] pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the then
fair market value of a share of Common Stock as determined by the Board of Directors. For such
purpose, all shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder of Preferred Stock shall be aggregated,

SE\9101417.6 -7-
ee

and any resulting fractional share of Common Stock shall be paid in cash. Before any holder of
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into full shares of Common Stock, and to
receive certificates therefor, he shall either (A) surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly
endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock or

(B) notify the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or
destroyed and execute an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation
from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates, and shall give written notice to the
Corporation at such office that he elects to convert the same; provided, however, that on the date of
an Automatic Conversion Event, the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall! be converted
automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the
certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent;
provided further, however, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing
the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such Automatic Conversion Event unless either the
certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are delivered to the Corporation or its transfer
agent as provided above, or the holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such
certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the
Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such
certificates. On the date of the occurrence of an Automatic Conversion Event, each holder of record
of shares of Preferred Stock shal! be deemed to be the holder of record of the Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion, notwithstanding that the certificates representing such shares of
Preferred Stock shall not have been surrendered at the office of the Corporation, that notice from the
Corporation shall not have been received by any holder of record of shares of Preferred Stock, or

that the certificates evidencing such shares of Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered to
such holder.

The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after such delivery or notice issue and deliver at
such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of
Common Stock to which he shall be entitled as aforesaid and a check payable to the holder in the
amount of any cash amounts payable as the result of a conversion into fractional shares of Common
Stock, plus any declared and unpaid dividends on the converted Preferred Stock. Such conversion
shall be deemed to have becn made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such
surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to
receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes
as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date; provided, however,
that if the conversion is in connection with an underwritten offer of securities registered pursuant to
the Securities Act or a merger, sale, financing, or liquidation of the Corporation or other event, the
conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned
upon the closing of such transaction or upon the occurrence of such event, in which case the
person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of the Preferred
Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the
closing of such transaction or the occurrence of such event.

(d) Adjustments to Conversion Price for Diluting Issues.

(i) Special Definition. For purposes of this Section 4(d), “Additional
Shares of Common” shall mean all shares of Common Stock issued (or, pursuant to paragraph

SE\9101417.6 -8-
4(d)(iii), deemed to be issued) by the Corporation after the filing of this Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, other than issuances or deemed issuances of securities:

(1) to officers, directors and employees of, or consultants to, the
Corporation pursuant to stock grants, option plans, purchase plans or other employee stock incentive
programs or arrangements approved by the Board of Directors, or upon exercise of options or
warrants granted to such parties pursuant to any such plan or arrangement;

(2) upon the exercise or conversion of Options, promissory notes, or
other Convertible Securities outstanding as of the date of the filing of this Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation;

(3) upon conversion of Preferred Stock, as a dividend or distribution
on Preferred Stock or pursuant to any event for which adjustment is made pursuant to paragraph
4(e), 4(f) or 4(g) hereof;

(4) in a Qualified Public Offering;

(5) pursuant to acquisition transactions, whether by merger, purchase
of substantially all of the assets or other reorganization or to a joint venture agreement, provided,
that such issuances are approved by the Board of Directors, including at least one of the Series B and
Series C Directors, as defined in that certain Amended and Restated Voting Agreement, dated as of
the date of the initial issuance of shares of Series C Preferred Stock, among the Corporation and the
holders of Preferred Stock;

(6) to banks, equipment lessors or other financial institutions pursuant
to a debt financing, commercial leasing, equipment financing, or similar transactions approved by
the Board of Directors, including at least one of the Series B and Series C Directors;

(7) with the approval of the holders of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, counted together as a single class on an as-converted to
Common Stock basis; and

(8) pursuant strategic partnership agreements, provided that such
issuances are approved by the Board of Directors, including at least one of the Series B and Series C
Directors.

(ii) | No Adjustment of Conversion Price. No adjustment in the Conversion
Price of a particular series of Preferred Stock shall be made in respect of the issuance of Additional
Shares of Common unless the consideration per share (as determined pursuant to Section 4(d)(v)) for
an Additional Share of Common issued or deemed to be issued by the Corporation is less than the
Conversion Price in effect on the date of, and immediately prior to such issue, for the Series C
Preferred Stock.

(iii) | Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the date of the filing of this Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall issue any Options or Convertible Securities or shall fix a

SE\9101417.6 -9-
record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive any such
Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of shares (as set forth in the
instrument relating thereto without regard to any provisions contained therein for a subsequent
adjustment of such number) of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Options or, in the
case of Convertible Securities, the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities or, in the
case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options and the conversion or
exchange of the underlying securities, shall be deemed to have been issued as of the time of such
issue or, in case such a record date shal] have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record
date, provided that in any such case in which shares are deemed to be issued:

(1) no further adjustment in the Conversion Price of any series of
Preferred Stock shall be made upon the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities or shares of
Common Stock in connection with the exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities;

(2) if such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms provide,
with the passage of time or otherwise, for any change in the consideration payable to the Corporation
or in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange
thereof (other than a change pursuant to the anti-dilution provisions of such Options or Convertible
Securities such as this Section 4(d) or pursuant to Recapitalization provisions of such Options or
Convertible Securities such as Sections 4(e), 4(f) and 4(g)hereof), the Conversion Price of each
series of Preferred Stock and any subsequent adjustments based thereon shall be recomputed to
reflect such change as if such change had been in effect as of the original issue thereof (or upon the
occurrence of the record date with respect thereto);

(3) no readjustment pursuant to clause (2) above shall have the effect
of increasing the Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock to an amount above the Conversion
Price that would have resulted from any other issuances of Additional Shares of Common and any

other adjustments provided for herein between the original adjustment date and such readjustment
date;

(4) upon the expiration of any such Options or any rights of
conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have been exercised, the
Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon
the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto) and any subsequent adjustments based thereon
shall, upon such expiration, be recomputed as if:

(a) in the case of Convertible Securities or Options for
Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common issued were the shares of Common Stock, if
any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities and the consideration received therefor was the consideration actually
received by the Corporation for the issue of such exercised Options plus the consideration actually
received by the Corporation upon such exercise or for the issue of all such Convertible Securities
which were actually converted or exchanged, plus the additional consideration, if any. actually
received by the Corporation upon such conversion or exchange, and

SE\9101417.6 -10-
(b) in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, only the
Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were issued at the time of
issue of such Options, and the consideration received by the Corporation for the Additional Shares of
Common deemed to have been then issued was the consideration actually received by the
Corporation for the issue of such exercised Options, plus the consideration deemed to have been
received by the Corporation (determined pursuant to Section 4(d)(v)) upon the issue of the
Convertible Securities with respect to which such Options were actually exercised; and

(5) if such record date shall have been fixed and such Options or
Convertible Securities are not issued on the date fixed therefor, the adjustment previously made in
the Conversion Price which became effective on such record date shall be canceled as of the close of
business on such record date, and thereafter the Conversion Price shal! be adjusted pursuant to this
paragraph 4(d)(iii) as of the actual date of their issuance.

(iv) Adjustment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional Shares
of Common.

(1) Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock. In the
event this Corporation shall issue Additional Shares of Common (including Additional Shares of
Common deemed to be issued pursuant to paragraph 4(d)(iii)) without consideration or for a
consideration per share less than the applicable Conversion Price of Series A Preferred Stock or
Series B Preferred Stock, as applicable, in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such issue,
then, the Conversion Price of such affected series of Preferred Stock shall be reduced, concurrently
with such issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying such
Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of shares which the aggregate
consideration received by the Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of Common so
issued would purchase at such Conversion Price, and the denominator of which shall be the number
of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of such
Additional Shares of Common so issued.

(2) Series C Preferred Stock. In the event this Corporation shall issue
Additional Shares of Common (including Additional Shares of Common deemed to be issued
pursuant to paragraph 4(d)(iii)) without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the
Conversion Price of Series C Preferred Stock in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such
issue. then, such Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price
(calculated to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the
numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior
to such issue plus the number of shares which the aggregate consideration received by the
Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of Common so issued would purchase at such
Conversion Price, and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Preferred Stock

outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of such Additional Shares of Common
so issued.

(3) Limitations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Conversion Price
shall not be reduced pursuant to this Subsection 4(d)(iv) at such time if the amount of such reduction

SE\9101417.6 -l1-
would be less than $0.01, but any such amount shall be carried forward, and a reduction will be
made with respect to such amount at the time of, and together with, any subsequent reduction which,
together with such amount and any other amounts so carried forward, equal $0.01 or more in the
aggregate. For the purposes of this Subsection 4(d)(iv), all shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock and the exercise and/or conversion of any
other outstanding Convertible Securities and al] outstanding Options shall be deemed to be
outstanding.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this subsection 4(d).
the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue (or deemed issue) of any Additional
Shares of Common shall be computed as follows:

(1) Cash and Property. Such consideration shall:

(a) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the aggregate
amount of cash received by the Corporation before deducting any reasonable discounts,
commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the Corporation for any underwriting or
otherwise in connection with such issuance;

(b) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair market value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors; and

(c) in the event Additional Shares of Common are issued
together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for consideration which
covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in clauses (a)
and (b) above, as reasonably determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(2) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per share
reccived by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common deemed to have been issued pursuant
to paragraph 4(d)(iii) shall be determined by dividing

(x) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the
Corporation as consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the
minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating
thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such
consideration) payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the
exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities by

(y) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as
set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a
subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion
or exchange of such Convertible Securities.

SE\9101417.6 -12-
(e) Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of Common Stock. In the event
the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided (by Recapitalization or otherwise), into
a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock
in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such
subdivision, be proportionately decreased. In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock
shall be combined (by reclassification or otherwise) into a lesser number of shares of Common
Stock, the Conversion Prices in effect immediately prior to such combination shall, concurrently
with the effectiveness of such combination, be proportionately increased.

(f) Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of Preferred Stock. In the event
the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock or a series of Preferred Stock shall be subdivided (by a
Recapitalization or otherwise), into a greater number of shares of Preferred Stock, the Dividend
Rate, Original Issue Price and Liquidation Preference of the affected series of Preferred Stock in
effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such
subdivision, be proportionately decreased. In the event the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock or
a series of Preferred Stock shall be combined (by reclassification or otherwise) into a lesser number
of shares of Preferred Stock, the Dividend Rate, Original Issue Price and Liquidation Preference of
the affected series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such combination shall,
concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination, be proportionately increased.

(g) Adjustments for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. Subject to
Section 3 above (“Liquidation Rights”), if the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the

Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of any other class or
classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a
subdivision or combination of shares provided for above), then, in any such event, in lieu of the
number of shares of Common Stock which the holders would otherwise have been entitled to receive
each holder of such Preferred Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such shares of Preferred
Stock into a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock which a holder of the number of
shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of such series of Preferred Stock immediately
before that change would have been entitled to receive in such reorganization or reclassification, all
subject to further adjustment as provided herein with respect to such other shares.

(h) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation at its expense shall
promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish
to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and
showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation
shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be
furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and readjustments, (ii) the
Conversion Price at the time in effect and (iii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the
amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon the conversion of
Preferred Stock.

(i) Waiver of Adjustment of Conversion Price. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, any downward adjustment of the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock may

SE\9101417.6 -13-
be waived by the consent or vote of the holders of the majority of the outstanding shares of such
series either before or after the issuance causing the adjustment.

(j) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at all
times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock solely
for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock, such number of its
shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then
outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding
shares of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion
of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such
number of shares as shal] be sufficient for such purpose.

5. Voting.

(a) Restricted Class Voting. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or as
required by law, the holders of Preferred Stock and the holders of Common Stock shall vote together
and not as separate classes.

(b) No Series Voting. Other than as expressly provided herein or required by law,
there shall be no series voting.

(c) Preferred Stock. Each holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to the number of
votes equal to the number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Preferred Stock held
by such holder could be converted as of the record date. The holders of shares of the Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to vote on all matters on which the Common Stock shall be entitled to vote. Holders
of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to notice of any stockholders’ meeting in accordance with the
Bylaws of the Corporation. Fractional votes shall not, however, be permitted and any fractional
voting rights resulting from the above formula (after aggregating all shares into which shares of
Preferred Stock held by each holder could be converted), shall be disregarded.

(d) Election of Directors. So long as at least 612,640 shares (as adjusted for
Recapitalizations) of Series A Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the holders of Series A Preferred
Stock, voting as a separate class, shall be entitled to elect one member of the Corporation’s Board of
Directors at each meeting or pursuant to each consent of the Corporation’s stockholders for the
election of directors. So long as at least 1,000,000 shares (as adjusted for Recapitalizations) of
Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the holders of Series B
Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock, voting together as a separate class, shall be entitled to
elect two members of the Corporation’s Board of Directors at each meeting or pursuant to each
consent of the Corporation’s stockholders for the election of directors. The holders of Common
Stock and Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class, shall elect any additional member of the
Corporation’s Board of Directors. If a vacancy on the Board of Directors is to be filled by the Board
of Directors, only directors elected by the same class or classes of stockholders as those who would
be entitled to vote to fill such vacancy shall vote to fill such vacancy.

SE\9101417.6 -14-

Common Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares of Common
Stock then outstanding) by an affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock of the

vote for each share thereof held.
