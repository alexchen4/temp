Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series B-1 Preferred Stock and Series C
Preferred Stock in connection with a Series D Acquisition is anticipated to be paid in
installments, prior to the time a Current Distribution of any installment is to be made, the total
amount available for the Cunent Distribution will be cumulated with all prior distributions made
in connection with the Series D Acquisition (including distributions relating to the Initial
Payments and the Catch-up Amount), and a calculation of the amount distributable to each
stockholder will be made as if the total cumulative amount had been paid in a single initial
distribution, assuming for purposes of such calculation that the Series A Preferred Stock. Series
B Preferred Stock, Series B-1 Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock elected to convert
such series of Preferred Stock to Common Stock in a manner that would yicld such series of
Preferred Stock the largest distribution. In the Current Distribution, cach such stockholder will
receive an amount such that when the Current Distribution is added to all prior distributions to
euch stockholder in connection with the Serles D Acquisition, each stockholder will have
received its Cumulative Distribution.

purpose of effecting the conversion of the Preferred Stock, such number of its duly authorized
shares of Common Stock as shal] from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all
outstanding Preferred Stock. Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment
reducing the Conversion Price below the then par value of the shares of Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation will, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary
in order that the Corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion Price.

(iii) Upon any such conversion, no adjusunent to the
Conversion Price shall be made tor any declared or accrued but unpaid dividends on the
Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion or on the Common Stock delivered upon conversion.

respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a

less than the Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to the
issuance of such Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents, the Conversion Price of such
series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall be decreased to
the amount determined in accordance with the following formula:

Conversion Price = (P1 x 01) + (P2 x O2)
Q1 + Q2

P] = Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance.

Q}

Number of shares of Common Stock deemed outstanding (in accordance with

exercisable or exchangeable security, provided, that the term Cammon Stock Equivalents shall
not include any rights, warrants or options to acquire Common Stock where the exercise or
“strike” price, or other amount payable in connection with the exercise or exchange of such
security, exceeds the fair market value of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such
exercise.

(ii) The per share consideration for the sale or issuance of
Common Stock shall be the price per share received by the Corporation before payment of

or receivable upon the sale or issuance of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents shall be
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

W02-WEST:3DCS511400135532.5 - 16-
of shares of Common Stock issuable with respect to such Common Stock Equivalents into the
aggregate consideration received by the Corporation upon the sale or issuance of such Common
Stuck Equivalents plus the minimum aggregate amount of any additional consideration
receivable by the Corporation upon the conversion or exercise of such Common Stock
Equivalents. For the purpose of calculation, such maximum number of shares shal! be asswned

to be issued on the earlier of the payment date or record date for a distribution of such Common
Stock Equivalents.

(iv) Lf any Common Stock Equivalents included in adjustments
under this Section B.5(d) expire or terminate without the Common Stock to which they related
having been issued, the Conversion Price shall be readjusted to eliminate the effect of the
assumed issuance of such Common Stock. If any Common Stock Equivalents by their terms
provide for subsequent increases in the additional consideration payable for the related Common
Stock or for subsequent decreases in the number of shares of Common Stock obtainable, then,
upon any such increase or decrease, the Conversion Price shall be appropriately readjusted to the
extent such Common Stock Equivalents have not then expired or been exercised or converted.
The aggregate increase in the Conversion Price caused by all such readjustments shall not exceed
the decrease in Conversion Price made upon the issuance of the Common Stock Equivalents to
which such readjustments relates. If any Common Stock Equivalents by their terms provide for
subsequent decreases in the additional consideration payable for the related Common Stock or
for subsequent increases in the number of shares of Common Stock obtainable, then, upon any
such decrease or increase, the Conversion Price shall be appropriately adjusted to the extent such
Common Stock Equivalents have not then expired or been exercised or converted,

(vy) In case the Corporation shall declare a dividend or make
any other distribution upon any stock of the Corporation payable in Common Stock or Common
Stock Equivalents, such Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents shall be deemed to have
been issued or sold without consideration as of the earlier of the related record or payment date.
