Common Stock”) without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Current
Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, or Series B1
Preferred Stock, as the case may be, except as set forth in Section IV D.(3)(d), then the
applicable Current Conversion Price sha!l simultancously with such issuance or sale be adjusied
to a Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series Bl Conversion Price,
respectively, (calculated to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying such then applicable
Current Conversion Price by a fraction,

(A) the numerator of which shall be (x) the number of shares of
Common Stock Outstanding at the close of business on the day immediately preceding the date
of such issuance or sale, plus (y) the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate
consideration received (or by the express provisions hereof deemed to have been received) by the
Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued or sold would
purchase at such then Current Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock and/or Series B1 Preferred Stock, as applicable, and (B) the denominator of
which shall be the number of shares »f Common Stock Outstanding at the close of business on
the date of such issuance or sale after giving effect to such issuance or sale of Additional Shares
of Common Stock. For the purpose of the immediately preceding calculation described in this
Section TV D.(3)(a), the number of shares of Common Stock Outstanding shall iiclude, in
addition to the number of shares of Common Stock actually outstanding, the nun.ber of shares of
Common Stock (x) into which the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series

into which any then outstanding warrants and other rights to subscribe for or purchase Common

(or, if such shares are offered by the Corporation for subscription, the subscription price, or, if
such shares are sold to underwriters or dealers for public offering without a subscription offering,
the initial public offering price), without deducting therefrom any compensation or discount paid
or allowed to underwriters or dealers or others performing similar services or for any expenses
incurred in connection therewith.

(ii) Non-Cash Consideration. In case of the issuance
(otherwise than upon conversion or exchange of Convertible Securities) or sale of Additional
Shares of Common Stock for consideration other than cash or for consideration a part of which
shall be other than cash, the fair value of such consideration as determined by the Board of
Directors of the Corporation ir the good faith exercise of its business judgment, irrespective of
the accounting treatment thereof, siiall be deemed to be the value, for purposes of this Section IV
D., of the consideration other than cash received b:’ the Corporation for such securities,

(iii) Qptions and Convertible Securities. In case the
Corporation shall in any manner issue or grant any Options or any Convertible Securities, the
total maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Options
or upon conversion or exchange of the total maximum amount of such Convertible Securities at
the time such Convertible Securities first become convertible or exchangeable shall (as of the
date of issue or grant of such Options or, in the case of the issue or sale of Convertible Securities
other than where the same are issuable upon the exercise of Options, as of the date of such issue
or sale) be deemed to be issued and to be outstanding for the purpose of this subsection

provisions of subsection D.(3)(b) below, no further adjustment of the Current Conversion Price
shall be made upon the actual issuance of any such Common Stock or Convertible Securities or
upon the conversion or exchange of any such Convertible Securities.

(b) Change in Option Price or Conversion Rate. If the purchase price
provided for in any Option referred to in subsection D.(3)a){iii), or the rate at which any
Convertible Securities referred to in subsection D.(3)(aXiii) are convertible into or exchangeable
for shares of Common Stock shall change at any time (other than under or by reason of
provisions designed to protect against dilution), the Current Conversion Price in effect at the
time of such event shall forthwith be readjusted to the Series A Conversion Price, Series B
Conversion Price, or Series B1 Conversion Price, as applicable, that would have been in effect at
such time had such Options or Convertible Securities still outstanding provided for such changes
purchase price, additional consideration or conversion rate, as the case may be, at the time same
were initially granted, issued or sold. If the purchase price provided for in any such Option
referred to in subsection D.(3Xa){iii), or the additional consideration (if any) payable upon the
conversion or exchange of any Convertible Securities referred to in subsection D.(3)a)(iii), or
the rate at which any Convertible Securities referred to in subsection D.(3a){iii) are convertible
into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock, shall be reduced at any time under or by
reason of provisions with respect thereto designed to protect against dilution, then, in case of the
delivery of shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of any such Option or upon conversion or

PA\M0409231.4
352238-2 8
exchange of any such Convertible Securities, the then Current Conversion Price for the Series A
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, and/or Series B1 Preferred Stock, as applicable, shall,
upon issuance of such shares of Common Stock, be adjusted to such amount as would have been
obtained had such Option or Convertible Securities never been issued and had adjustments been
made only upon the issuance of the shares of Common Stock delivered as aforesaid and for the
consideration actuaily received for such Option or Convertible Securities and the Common
Stock.

(c) mination _o tion or Conversion Rights. Upon the
termination or expiration of any right to purchase Common Stock under any Option or of any
right to convert or exchange Convertible Securities, the Current Conversion Price for the Series
A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, and/or Series Bi Preferred Stock, as applicable,
shall, upon such termination, be changed to the Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion
Price, and/or Series BI Conversion Price that would have been in effect at the time of such
expiration or termination had such Option or Convertible Securities, to the extent outstanding
immediately prior to such expiration or termination, never been issued, and the shares of

such record date (or the date of such dividend, distribution, split or subdivision if no record date

or Series Bl Preferred Stock, as the case may be, shall be increased in proportion to such
increase in the number of outstanding shares of Common Stuck (including for this purpose,
Common Stock Equivalents). If the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock at any time
after the Issuance Date is decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of Common
Stock, then, following the record date of such combination, the Series A Conversion Price, Series
B Conversion Price, and Serics B! Conversion Price, as applicable, shall be appropriately
increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of
Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred and S:ries BI Preferred shall be decreased in proportion

sale of assets transaction provided for elsewhere in this Section IV D.), provision shall be made
so ihat the holders of Series A Preferred Stuck, Series B Preferred Stock, and Series B1 Preferred
Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of shares of Series A Preferred
Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series B1 Preferred Stock the number of shares of stock or
other securities or property of the Corporation or otherwise, to which a holder of Common Stock
deliverable upon such conversion would have been entitled on such recapitalization. In any such
case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section IV
D. with respect to the rights of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock
and Series B1 Preferred Stock, after the recapitalization to the end that the provisions of this

Conversion Price, and/or Series B1 Conversion Price, then the respective Conversion Price will
be so equitably reduced.

(i) No Impairment. The Corporation will not, by amendment of these
Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation or through any reorganization,
recapitalization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, liquidation, dissolution, issue or sale of
securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of
any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Corporation, but will at all times
in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Section IV D. and in the taking
of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of
the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, and/or Series B1 Preferred
