In the event of a merger or other acquisition of the Corporation by another entity, the
Distribution date shall be deemed to be the date such transaction closes.

other exchanges, markets and systems, the market price as of the end of the regular hours trading

hercof, the benchmark times generally accepted in the securities industry for determining the market
price of a stock as of a given trading day shall change from those set forth above, the fair market

4. Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as follows
(the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option
of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share at the office of the
Corporation or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, into that number of fully-paid,
nonassessable shares of Common Stock determined by multiplying each share of Preferred Stock by
the Conversion Rate (as defined below) then in effect for such Preferred Stock. The “Conversion
Rate” for each such series shall be the quotient obtained by dividing the Original Issue Price for the
relevant series of Preferred Stock by the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock,
calculated to the nearest hundredth. Upon any decrease or increase in the Conversion Price for any

series of Preferred Stock, as described in this Section 4, the Conversion Rate for such series shal] be
appropriately increased or decreased.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be
converted into fully-paid, non-assessable shares of Common Stock at the then effective Conversion
Rate for such share (i) immediately prior to the closing of a firm commitment underwritten public
offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the “Securities Act”), covering the offer and sale of the Corporation’s Common Stock, provided
that the offering price per share is not less than $3.04 (as adjusted for Recapitalizations) and the
aggregate gross proceeds to the Corporation are not less than $45,000,000, or (ii) upon the receipt by
the Corporation of a written consent pursuant to California Corporations Code section 603 for such
- conversion from the holders of a majority of the Preferred Stock (on an as-converted basis) then

outstanding, or, if later, the effective date for conversion specified in such consent (each of the
events referred to in (i) and (ii) are referred to herein as an “Automatic Conversion Event”).

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued
upon conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would
otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the then
fair market value of a share of Common Stock as determined by the Board of Directors. For such
purpose, all shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder of Preferred Stock shalt be aggregated,
and, upon conversion, any resulting fractional share of Common Stock shall be paid in cash. Before
any holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into full shares of Common Stock,
and to receive certificates therefor, they shall either (A) surrender the certificate or certificates
therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for the Preferred
Stock or (B) notify the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen
or destroyed and execute an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation
from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates, and shall give written notice to the
Corporation at such office that they elect to convert the same; provided, however, that on the date of
an Automatic Conversion Event, the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted
automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the
certificates representing such shares are sumendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent;
provided further, however, that the Corporation shall] not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing
the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such Automatic Conversion Event unless either the

4187925 _6.D0C
certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are delivered to the Corporation or its transfer
agent as provided above, or the holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such
certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the
Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such
certificates. On the date of the occurrence of an Automatic Conversion Event, each holder of record
of shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion, notwithstanding that the certificates representing such shares of
Preferred Stock shall not have been surrendered at the office of the Corporation, that notice from the
Corporation shall not have been received by any holder of record of shares of Preferred Stock, or

that the certificates evidencing such shares of Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered to
such holder.

The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after such delivery, or after such agreement and
indemnification, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as
aforesaid and a check payable to the holder in the amount of any cash amounts payable as the result
of a conversion into fractional shares of Common Stock, plus any declared and unpaid dividends on
the converted Preferred Stock. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately
prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be
converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon
such conversion shall be treated for ali purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of
Common Stock on such date; provided, however, that if the conversion is in connection with an
underwritten offer of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act or a merger, sale or
liquidation of the Corporation, the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering Preferred
Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing of such transaction, in which event the
person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of the Preferred

Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the
closing of such transaction.

(d) Adjustments to Conversion Price for Diluting Issues.

G) Special Definition. For purposes of this Section 4(d), ‘Additional
Shares_of Common” shall mean all shares of Common Stock issued (or, pursuant to

Corporation at any time or from time to time after the date of the filing of this Amended and
Restated Articles of Incorporation shall issue any Options or Convertible Securities or shall fix a

date, provided that in any such case in which shares are deemed to be issued:

(1) no further adjustment in the Conversion Price of any series of
Preferred Stock shall be made upon the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities or shares of

Common Stock in connection with the exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities;

thereof (other than a change pursuant to the anti-dilution provisions of such Options or Convertible
Securities such as this Section 4(d) or pursuant to Recapitalization provisions of such Options or

4157915_6.0C
reflect such change as if such change had been in effect as of the original issue thereof (or upon the
occurrence of the record date with respect thereto); — - :

(3) no readjustment pursuant to clause (2) above shall have the effect
of increasing the Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock to an amount above the Conversion
Price that would have resulted from any other issuances of Additional Shares of Common and any

other adjustments provided for herein between the original adjustment date and such readjustment
date;

(4) upon the expiration of any such Options or any rights of
conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have been exercised, the
Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon

the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto) and any subsequent adjustments based thereon
shall, upon such expiration, be recomputed as if-

(A) im the case of Convertible Securities or Options for
Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common issued were the shares of Common Stock, tf
any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities and the consideration received therefor was the consideration actually
received by the Corporation for the issue of such exercised Options plus the consideration actually
received by the Corporation upon such exercise or for the issue of all such Convertible Securities
which were actually converted or exchanged, plus the additional consideration, if any, actually
received by the Corporation upon such’conversion or exchange, and

(B) in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, only
the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were issued at the time of
issue of such Options, and the consideration received by the Corporation for the Additional Shares of
Common deemed to have been then issued was the consideration actually received by ‘the
Corporation for the issue of such exercised Options, plus the consideration deemed to have been
received by the Corporation (determined pursuant to Section 4(d}(v)) upon the issue of the
Convertible Securities with respect to which such Options were actually exercised; and

(5) if such record date shall have been fixed and such Options or
Convertible Securities are not issued on the date fixed therefor, the adjustment previously made in
the Conversion Price which became effective on such record date shall be canceled as of the close of

business on such record date, and thereafter the Conversion Price shalt be adjusted pursuant to this
Section 4(d)(iii) as of the actual date of their issuance.

(iv) Adjustment _of Conversion Price Upon Issuance_of Additional Shares
of Common. In the event the Corporation shall issue Additional Shares of Common (including
Additional Shares: of Common deemed to be: issued pursuant to Section 4(d)(iii)) without
consideration or for a consideration per share less than the applicable Conversion Price of a series of
Preferred Stock in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such issue, then: (a) with respect to
the Series A Preferred Stock, the Conversion Price of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be reduced,
concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying
such Conversion Price by a fraction, (x) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of shares which the
aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of

Common so issued would purchase at such Conversion Price, and (y) the denominator of which shall
4157915 _6.DOC
be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the
number of such Additional Shares of Common so issued; and (b) with respect to the Series C
Preferred Stock, the Series B-1 Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock, the Conversion
Price of the Series C Preferred Stock, the Series B-1 Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred
Stock, respectively, shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price equal to the
consideration per share received by the Corporation for such Additional Shares of Common so
issued. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Conversion Price shall not be reduced at such time if the
amount of such reduction would be less than $0.01. For the purposes of this Subsection 4(d){iv), all
shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock and

the exercise and/or conversion of any other outstanding Convertible Securities and all outstanding
Opuons shall be deemed to be outstanding.

{v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this subsection 4(d),
the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue (or deemed issue) of any Additional
Shares of Common shall be computed as follows:

(1) Cash and Property. Such consideration shall:

{a) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
aggregate amount of cash received by the Corporation;

{b) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair market value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors; and

(c) in the event Additional Shares of Common are issued
together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for consideration which
covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in clauses
(a) and (b) above, as reasonably determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(2) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per share
received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common deemed to have been issued pursuant
to Section 4(d)(i11) shall be determined by dividing:

{x) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the
Corporation as consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the

minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating
thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such
consideration) payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertibie Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the

exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities, by

(y) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, other than a change pursuant to the anli-
dilution provisions of such Options or Convertible Securities such as this Section 4(d) or pursuant to

Recapitalization provisions of such Options or Convertible Securities such as Sections 4{e), 4(f),

dividend or otherwise), into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price of
each series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall, concurrently
with the effectiveness of such subdivision, be proportionately decreased. In the event the
outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined (by reclassification or otherwise) into a
lesser number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Prices of each series of Preferred Stock

in effect immediately prior to such combination shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such
combination, be proportionately increased.

(f) Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of Preferred Stock. In the event
the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock or a series of Preferred Stock shall be subdivided (by stock
split, by payment of a stock dividend or otherwise), into a greater number of shares of Preferred
Stock, the Original Issue Price and Liquidation Preference of the affected series of Preferred Stock in
effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such
subdivision, be proportionately decreased. In the event the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock or
a series of Preferred Stock shall be combined (by reclassification or otherwise) into a lesser number
of shares of Preferred Stock, the Original Issue Price and Liquidation Preference of the affected
series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such combination shall, concurrently with the
effectiveness of such combination, be proportionately increased.

(g) Adjustment for Common Stock Dividends and Distributions. If the Corporation,
at any time or from time to time after the date of filing of this Amended and Restated Articles of
Incorporation, makes, or fixes a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock
entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in shares of Common Stock, in each such
event the Conversion Price then in effect for each series of Preferred Stock shall be decreased as of
the time of such issuance or, in the event such record date is fixed, as of the close of business on
such record date, by multiplying the Conversion Price then in effect for such series of Preferred
Stock by a fraction (i) the numerator of which is the total number of shares of Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issues or the close of business on such record
date and (ii) the denominator of which is the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of business on such record
date plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or
distribution; provided, however, that if such record date is fixed and such dividend is not fully paid
or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the Conversion Price for each
series of Preferred Stock shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record

date and thereafter the Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this Section 4(g) to reflect the
actual payment of such dividend or distribution.

(h) Adjustments for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. Subject to
Section 3 above, if at any time or from time to time, the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of
the Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of any other class
or classes of stock, whether by recapitalization, capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise
(other than a subdivision, combination of shares or merger or sale of assets provided for above or in
Section 3), then, in any such event, in lieu of the number of shares of Common Stock which the
holders would otherwise have been entitled to receive, each holder of such Preferred Stock shall
have the right thereafter to convert such shares of Preferred Stock into a number of shares of such
other class or classes of stock which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable
4157915 _6, DOC
upon conversion of such series of Preferred Stock immediately before that change would have been
entitled to receive in such reorganization or reclassification, all subject to further adjustment as
provided herein with respect to such other shares. In addition, to the extent applicable in any
yeorganization or recapitalization, provision shall be made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock
shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of the Preferred Stock the number of shares of
stock or other securities or property of the Corporation or otherwise, to which a holder of Common

Stock deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled on such reorganization or
recapitalization.

(i) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation at its expense shall
promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and fumish
to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and
showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation
shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be
furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and readjustments, (ii) the
Conversion Price at the time in effect and (iii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the

amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon the conversion of
Preferred Stock.

(j) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at all
times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock solely
for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock, such number of its
shares of Common Stock as shal] from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then
outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding
shares of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion

of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such
number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.

rata among the holders of the Preferred Stock so that each holder of Preferred Stock shall receive a
redemption payment equal to a fraction of the aggregate amount available for redemption, the
numerator of which is the number of shares of Preferred Stock held by such holder with each
number multiplied by the Redemption Price of each share of Preferred Stock held by such holder,
and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding multiplied by
the Redemption Price of each such outstanding share of Preferred Stock, and the Corporation shall
redeem the remaining shares to be redeemed as soon as sufficient funds are legally available.
