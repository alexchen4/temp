Series A Stock and Series B Stock then outstanding for a cash amount per share
determined as set forth herein (the “Special Liquidation Price,” said redemption being
referred to herein as a “Special Liquidation”). In the event the Event of Sale involves
consideration that does not consist of cash, then the Special Liquidation Price may be
paid with such consideration having a value equal to the Special Liquidation Price. To
the extent there is any cash consideration in connection with an Event of Sale, the cash
consideration will first be applied to satisfy the Special Liquidation Price prior to the
payment thereof to any stockholders of the Corporation. For all purposes of this Section
A.4(e), the Special Liquidation Price shall be equal to that amount per share which would
be received by each Series B Stockholder and each Series A Stockholder if, in connection

Stockholder shall be entitled to receive the Special Liquidation Price for each such share
of Preferred Stock owned by such holder. Subject to the provisions of Section A.4(e)(iii)
hereof, payment of the Special Liquidation Price will be made upon actual delivery to the
Corporation or its transfer agent of the certificate representing such shares of Preferred
Stock, or an affidavit of loss as to the same.

Gii) fon the Special Liquidation Date less than all of the shares of
either the Series A Stock or Series B Stock then outstanding may be legally redeemed by
the Corporation, the Special Liquidation shall be made first as to the Series B Stock pro
rata with respect to such Series B Stock based upon the number of outstanding shares of
Series B Stock then owned by each such holder thereof until such holders are satisfied in
full and then to the holders of the Series A Stock pro rata with respect to such Series A
Stock based upon the number of outstanding shares of Series A Stock then owned by
each holder thereof.
(iv) Onand after any Special Liquidation Date, all rights in respect of
the shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall cease and terminate except the right to
receive the applicable Special Liquidation Price as provided herein, and such shares of
Preferred Stock shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding, whether or not the
certificates representing such shares of Preferred Stock have been received by the

holder(s) thereof with respect to such shares of Preferred Stock shall continue until the
Corporation cures such default.

provisions of this Section A.4(e) may be waived by the holders of a majority of the
voting power of the shares of Series B Stock then outstanding, by delivery of written
notice of waiver to the Corporation prior to the closing of any Event of Sale, in which
event the Corporation shall not redeem any shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this
Section A.4(f).

Liquidation under this Section A.4(d) and (B) the extent to which the Corporation will, if
at all, be legally prohibited from paying each holder of Preferred Stock the Special
Liquidation Price.

(vii) For purposes of this Section A.4(e), an “Event of Sale” shall mean
(A) the merger or consolidation of the Corporation into or with another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other entity, or the merger or consolidation of any
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other entity (collectively, an “Entity’’) into

Corporation receive distributions of cash or securities as a result of such consolidation or
merger in complete exchange for their shares of capital stock of the Corporation), or (B)

specify in a written notice to the Corporation the number of shares which the Requesting Holder
elects to redeem (a “Redemption Notice”), in accordance with Section A.5(c) hereof. The total
sum payable per share of Series B Stock on the Redemption Date or on the subsequent

under this Section A.5 and cause the immediate redemption of all, but not less than all, of the
shares of Series B Stock held by the Series B Stockholders. With respect to a breach of which

Corporation shall have the right to cure such breach shall be deemed to have commenced on the
tenth day after the occurrence of such breach, irrespective of notice of such breach from an
Investor. if the Corporation shall not have notified the Investors of such breach by such date.

(b) Onand after each Redemption Date, all rights of any Requesting Holder
with respect to those shares of Series B Stock being redeemed by the Corporation pursuant to
Section A.5(a) on such Redemption Date, except the right to receive the Redemption Price per
share of Series B Stock as hereinafter provided, shall cease and terminate, and such shares of
Series B Stock shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding, whether or not the certificates
representing such shares have been received by the Corporation; provided, however, that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, (A) if the Corporation defaults in the
payment of the Redemption Payment, the rights of the Requesting Holder with respect to such
shares of Series B Stock shall continue until the Corporation cures such default, and (B) without
limiting any other rights of a Requesting Holder, upon the occurrence of a subsequent
Liquidation or Event of Sale, with respect to the shares of Series B Stock in respect of which no

previous Redemption Notice, each such Series B Stockholder shall send a Redemption Notice to

Certificate of Incorporation in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the
rights reserved in this Article VIII.

Except as otherwise required by law, holders of Common Stock, as such, shall not be entitled to
vote on any amendment to this Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of
Designations relating to any series of Preferred Stock) that relates solely to the terms of one or
more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled,
either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon

ARTICLE [X
Compromises and Arrangements

Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed between the Corporation and its
creditors or any class of them and/or between the Corporation and its stockholders or any class of
them, any court of equitable jurisdiction within the State of Delaware may, on the application in
a summary way of the Corporation or of any creditor or stockholder thereof or on the application
of any receiver or receivers appointed for the Corporation under Section 291 of the Delaware
General Corporation Law or on the application of trustees in dissolution or of any receiver or
receivers appointed for the Corporation under Section 279 of the Delaware General Corporation
Law, order a meeting of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of
stockholders of the Corporation, as the case may be, to be summoned in such manner as such
court directs. If a majority in number representing three-fourths in value of the creditors or class
of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of the Corporation, as the case
may be, agree to any compromise or arrangement and to any reorganization of the Corporation as
a consequence of such compromise or arrangement, then such compromise or arrangement and

binding on all the creditors or class of creditors, and/or on all of the stockholders or class of
stockholders of the Corporation, as the case may be, and also on the Corporation.

ARTICLE X
Limitation of Liability

No director of the Corporation shall be liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for
monetary damages for breach of his or her fiduciary duty as director; provided, however, that
nothing contained in this Article X shall eliminate or limit the liability of a director:

(a) for any breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its
stockholders;

(b) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional
misconduct or a knowing violation of the law;

(c) under Section 174 of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware; or

(d) for any transaction from which the director derived improper personal
benefit.

No amendment to or repeal of this Article X shall apply to or have any effect on the
liability or alleged liability of any director of the Corporation for or with respect to any acts or
omissions of such director occurring prior to such amendment or repeal. If the Delaware General
Corporation Law is subsequently amended to further eliminate or limit the liability of a director.
then a director of the Corporation, in addition to the circumstances in which a director is not
personally liable as set forth in this Article X, shall not be liable to the fullest extent permitted by
the amended Delaware General Corporation Law.
