1, Dividends

When, as and if declared by the Corporation's Board of Directors (the "Board") the
holders of shares of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, on a pari passu basis, dividends
out of any assets legally available therefor, prior and in preference to any declaration or payment
of any dividend (other than dividends payable in Common Stock or other securities and rights
convertible into or entitling the holder thereof to receive, directly or indirectly, additional shares
of Common Stock of the Corporation, provided that an adjustment to the Series A Conversion
Price (as defined below) and the Series B Conversion Price (as defined below) has been made in
accordance with Section 3(d)(ii) below) on the Common Stock of the Corporation, at the rate of
(a) $0.03695 per share per annum on each outstanding share of Series A Preferred (subject to
proportional adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combinations,
recapitalization, reclassification or other similar event affecting such shares) and (b) $0.08078
per share per annum on each outstanding share of Series B Preferred (subject to proportional
adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combinations, recapitalization,
reclassification or other similar event affecting such shares). Such dividends shall not be
cumulative, and no right thereto shall accrue if such dividends are not declared. After ;
satisfaction of the foregoing dividend preferences, the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to share,
on an as-converted to Common Stock basis (an "As Converted Basis"), in any dividend declared

61016-0004/LEGAL13103771.7 -}-
and paid with respect to the Common Stock. For the purpose of determining the legality of
distributions pursuant to Section 23B.06.400(2)(b) of the Revised Code of Washington, or any
successor Statute, repurchases or redemptions of Common Stock may be made without reference
to the amount required to satisfy the liquidation preferences set forth in Section 2 below.

2. Liquidation
(a) Priority of Payments

Upon a Liquidation Event (as defined below), the assets and funds legally available for
distribution to shareholders of the Corporation ("Distributable Proceeds") shall be distributed
as follows:

(i) The holders of shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding shall be entitled
to be paid on a pari passu basis out of the Distributable Proceeds, before any payment is made to
the holders of Common Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount equal to (a)
$0.4619 per share of Series A Preferred (subject to proportional adjustment in the event of any
stock dividend, stock split, combination, recapitalization, reclassification or other similar event
with respect to the Series A Preferred) (the "Series A Liquidation Amount") plus any declared
but unpaid dividends on such shares of Series A Preferred and (b) $1.0098 per share of Series B
Preferred (subject to proportional adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split,
combination, recapitalization, reclassification or other similar event with respect to the Senes B
Preferred) (the "Series B Liquidation Amount") plus any declared but unpaid dividends on
such shares of Series B Preferred. If, upon any such Liquidation Event, the Distributable
Proceeds are insufficient to pay the holders of Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred the full
amount of the Series A Liquidation Amount and the Series B Liquidation Amount, respectively,
plus any declared but unpaid dividends thereon, then all Distributable Proceeds shall be
distributed ratably among the holders of Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred in proportion
to the preferential amount each such holder otherwise would have been entitled to receive.

(ii) | Upon the completion of the distributions to the holders of Preferred Stock
as described above, the remaining Distributable Proceeds shall! be distributed among the holders
of Common Stock pro rata based on the number of shares of Common Stock held by each.
Nothing contained in this Section 2 shall limit the night of holders of Preferred Stock to convert
their shares into Common Stock at any time prior to or simultaneously with the closing of a
Liquidation Event, provided that shares of Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to be converted
into shares of Common Stock in order to participate in any Liquidation Event, or series of
Liquidation Events, as shares of Common Stock, without first foregoing participation in the
Liquidation Event, or series of Liquidation Events, as shares of Preferred Stock.

{b) Liquidation Events

(i) Definition. For purposes of this Section 2, a "Liquidation Event" shall
mean: (A) the closing of the sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the
Corporation's assets (including an exclusive license with respect to all or substantially all of the
Corporation's intellectual property), (B) the consummation of a merger, share exchange or
consolidation of the Corporation with or into another entity (except one in which the holders of
capital stock of the Corporation as constituted immediately prior to such merger, share exchange

61016-0004/LEGAL13103771.7 -2-
or consolidation continue to hold at least 50% of the voting power of the capital stock of the
Corporation or the surviving or acquiring entity (or its parent entity)); or (C) a liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation (whether voluntary or involuntary).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) a transaction under (B) of the prior sentence shall not
constitute a Liquidation Event if its purpose is (x) to change the state of the Corporation's
incorporation, or (y) to create a holding company that will be owned in substantially the same
proportions by the persons who held the Corporation's securities immediately prior to such
transaction; and (2) any transaction or event otherwise constituting a Liquidation Event under
this paragraph shall be deemed to be exempt from such definition if (x) the holders of at least
60% of the then outstanding Preferred Stock (voting together as a single voting group on an As
Converted Basis) so agree by vote or written consent or (y) the Board, including the Series A
Director and the Series B Director (each as defined below) specifically approves the transaction
or event as an exempt transaction or event from the definition of a Liquidation Event.

(i) Valuation of Consideration. If the consideration received in a
Liquidation Event is other than cash, its value will be deemed its fair market value as determined
in good faith by the Board. Any securities shall be valued as follows:

(A) Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar
restrictions on free marketability:

(1) If traded on a securities exchange or a national quotation
system, the value shal] be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such
exchange or quotation system over the twenty trading-day period ending on the third trading day
prior to the closing;

(2) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the
twenty trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to the closing; and

(3)  Ifthere is no active public market, the value shall be the
fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Board and the holders of at least 60% of
the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (voting together as a single voting group on an As
Converted Basis).

(B) The method of valuation of securities subject to investment letter
or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of a
shareholder's status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount
from the market value determined as above in Section 2(b)(ii)(A) to reflect the approximate fair
market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board.

(C) The foregoing methods for valuing non-cash consideration to be
distributed in connection with a Liquidation Event shall, upon approval by the Company's
shareholders of the definitive agreements governing a Liquidation Event in accordance with
Article I], Section 4, be superseded by any determination of such value set forth in the definitive
agreements governing such Liquidation Event.

61016-0004/LEGAL13103771.7 -3-
3. Conversion

The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have the right to convert their shares of Preferred
Stock into Common Stock as provided in this Section 3.

(a) Voluntary Conversion

Subject to Section 3(c), each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the
option of the holder thereof, at any time aficr the date of issuance of such share, at the office of
the Corporation or any transfer agent for such stock, into such number of fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Liquidation Amount for
that series of Preferred Stock by the Conversion Price (as defined below) for that series of
Preferred Stock in effect on the effective date of such conversion, as determined below. The
initial Series A Preferred Conversion Price shall be equal to the Series A Liquidation Amount
(the “Series A Conversion Price"), and the initial Series B Preferred Conversion Price shall be
equal to the Series B Liquidation Amount (the "Series B Conversion Price"). Such initial
Series A Conversion Price and Series B Conversion Price (as applicable, the "Applicable
Conversion Price") shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 3(d).

(b) Automatic Conversion

Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of Common
Stock at the Applicable Conversion Price at the time in effect for such share immediately upon
the earlier of (i) the date specified by the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least
60% of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (voting together as a single voting group on an
As Converted Basis), and (ii) the effective date of the registration statement under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), with respect to an underwritten public offering
of the Corporation's Common Stock in which the public offering price results in gross proceeds
to the Corporation of at least $30,000,000 (a "Qualified Public Offering").

(c) Mechanics of Conversion

Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert such shares into shares
of Common Stock under Section 3(a) above, such holder shall (i) either (A) surrender the
certificate or certificates for the shares to be converted, duly endorsed, at the office of the
Corporation or of any transfer agent for such series of Preferred Stock, or (B) notify the
Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and
execute an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss
incurred by it in connection with such certificates, and (ii) give written notice to the Corporation
at its principal corporate office of the election to convert such shares and shall state therein the
name or names in which the certificate or certificates for the shares of Common Stock issuable
upon such conversion are to be issued. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter,
issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or nominees
of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which
such holder shall be entitled upon such conversion. Such conversion shall be deemed to have
been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date on which the requirements of
the first sentence of this paragraph have been satisfied with respect to the shares of such series of
Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of

61016-0004/LEGAL13103771.7 -4-
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record
holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock as of such date. In connection with any
automatic conversion of Preferred Stock under Section 3(b) above, such conversion shall be
deemed effective with respect to all shares of such Preferred Stock so converted as of the
effective date of the vote or consent referred to in clause (i) of such subsection or the effective
date of the Qualified Public Offering registration statement referred to in clause (ii) of such
subsection; provided, however, that if the automatic conversion is in connection with a Qualified
Public Offering, the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering such Preferred Stock
for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of securities
pursuant to such Qualified Public Offering, in which event the person(s) entitled to receive the
shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such Preferred Stock shall not be deemed
to have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of
securities. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after the effective date of any automatic
conversion, issue and deliver, at the Corporation's principal corporate office, to each holder of
Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the
number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled upon such conversion,
subject to any such holder first providing to the Corporation the documentation referred to in
clauses (1)(A) or (i)(B) of this paragraph. The person or persons entitled to reccive the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record
holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock as of the effective date of conversion as
provided above.

(d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock for Certain Dilutive
Issuances, Splits and Combinations

The Applicable Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock shall be subject to
adjustment from time to time as follows:

(i) Issuance of Additional Stock below Purchase Price. If the Corporation
shall issue, after the first issuance of shares of Series B Preferred (the "Purchase Date"), any
Additional Stock (as defined below) for a consideration per share less than the Applicable
Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to the issuance of
such Additional Stock, then, in each such case, the Applicable Conversion Price for such series
of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such issuance shall automatically be adjusted as
set forth in this Section 3(d)(i), unless otherwise provided in this Section 3(d)(i).

(A) Adjustment Formula. Whenever the Applicable Conversion
Price for a given series of Preferred Stock is adjusted pursuant to this Section 3(d)(i), the new
Applicable Conversion Price shall be determined by multiplying the Applicable Conversion
Price in effect immediately prior to the issuance of Additional Stock by a fraction, (x) the
numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (or deemed to
be outstanding pursuant to Section 3(d)(i)(E) below) immediately prior to such issuance (the
“Outstanding Common") plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate
consideration received by the Corporation for such issuance would purchase at such Applicable
Conversion Price; and (y) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of
Outstanding Common plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock.

61016-0004/LEGAL13103771.7 -5-
(B) Definition of Additional Stock. For purposes of this
Section 3(d)(i), "Additional Stock" shall mean any shares of Common Stock issued (or deemed
to have been issued pursuant to Section 3(d)(i)(E)) by the Corporation after the Purchase Date,
other than:

(1) | Common Stock issued pursuant to a transaction described

in Section 3(d){ii) hereof;

(2) Capital stock, or warrants or options to purchase capital
stock, issued to employees, directors, consultants or other service providers of the Corporation
pursuant to a stock option plan or other compensatory agreements or arrangements approved by
the Board, including the Series A Director and the Series B Director;

(3) Capital stock, or warrants or options to purchase capital
stock, issued in connection with bona fide acquisitions, mergers or similar transactions;

(4) Capital stock, or options or warrants to purchase capital
stock, issued in connection with commercial credit arrangements, equipment financings, or
similar transactions, plans or arrangements, provided that such transactions, plans or
arrangements are (A) effected primarily for purposes other than raising equity capital and (B)
approved by the Board, including the Series A Director and the Series B Director;

(5) Common Stock issued or issuable upon conversion of
Preferred Stock;

(6) Common Stock issued or issuable in a Qualified Public
Offering;

(7) Capital stock issued or issuable upon exercise of options,
warrants or convertible notes of the Corporation outstanding as of the Purchase Date; or

(8) Capital stock, or options or warrants to purchase capital
stock, issued in connection with strategic collaborations, development agreements, licensing
transactions or similar transactions, plans or arrangements, provided that such transactions, plans
or arrangements are (A) effected primarily for purposes other than raising equity capital and (B)
approved by the Board, including the Series A Director and the Series B Director.

(C) No Fractional Adjustments. No adjustment of the Applicable
Conversion Price for a series of Preferred Stock shall be made in an amount less than one
hundredth of a cent per share, provided that any adjustments which are not required to be made
by reason of this sentence shall be carried forward and shall be either taken into account in any
subsequent adjustment made prior to three years from the date of the event giving rise to the
adjustment being carried forward, or shall be made at the end of three years from the date of the
event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward.

(D) Determination of Consideration. In the case of the issuance of

Common Stock for cash, the consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid
therefor before deducting any reasonable discounts, commissions, compensations or concessions

61016-0004/LEGAL13103771.7 -6-
allowed, paid or incurred by the Corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection
with the issuance and sale thereof and without deductions of any other expenses paid by the
Corporation. In the case of the issuance of Common Stock for a consideration in whole or in
part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be deemed to be the fair valuc
thereof as determined in good faith by the Board irrespective of any accounting treatment.

(E) Deemed Issuances of Common Stock. In the case of the issuance
of options or warrants to purchase, or other rights to subscribe for, shares of Common Stock,
securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock, or options or
warrants to purchase, or other rights to subscribe for, such convertible or exchangeable
securities. the following provisions shall apply for all purposes of this Section 3(d)(1):

(1) The aggregate maximum number of shares of Common
Stock deliverable upon exercise (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to exercisability,
including without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account potential
antidilution adjustments) of such options or warrants to purchase, or other rights to subscribe for,
Common Stock shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such options, warrants or rights
were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the manner
provided in Section 3(d)(i)(D)), if any, received by the Corporation upon the issuance of such
options, warrants or rights plus the minimum exercise price provided in such options, warrants or
rights (without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) for the Common Stock
covered thereby.

(2) | The aggregate maximum number of shares of Common
Stock deliverable upon conversion of or in exchange (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions
to convertibility or exchangeability, including, without limitation, the passage of time, but
without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) for any such convertible or
exchangeable securities, or upon the exercise of options or warrants to purchase, or other rights
to subscribe for, such convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or
exchange thereof shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or
such options, warrants or rights were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration, if
any, received by the Corporation for any such securities and related options, warrants or rights
(excluding any cash received on account of accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the
minimum additional consideration, if any, to be received by the Corporation (without taking into
account potential antidilution adjustments) upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or
the exercise of any related options, warrants or rights (the consideration in each case to be
determined in the manner provided in Section 3(d)(i)(D)).

(3) In the event of any change in the number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon exercise of
such options, warrants or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such convertible or
exchangeable securities, including without limitation a change resulting from the antidilution
provisions thereof, the Applicable Conversion Price for each affected series of Preferred Stock,
to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, warrants, rights or
securities, shall be recomputed to reflect such change, but no further adjustment shall be made
for the actual issuance of Common Stock or any payment of such consideration upon the
exercise of any such options, warrants or rights or the conversion or exchange of such securities.

61015-0004/LEGAL13103771.7 -7-
(4) Upon the expiration of any such options, warrants or rights,
the termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options,
warrants or rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Applicable
Conversion Price for each affected series of Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected by
or computed using such options, warrants, rights or securities or options, warrants or rights
related to such securities, shal] be recomputed to reflect the issuance of only the number of
shares of Common Stock (and convertible or exchangeable securities which remain in effect)
actually issued upon the exercise of such options, warrants or rights, upon the conversion or
exchange of such securities or upon the exercise of the options, warrants or rights related to such
securities.

(5) | The number of shares of Common Stock deemed issued
and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to Sections 3(d)(i)(E)(1) and 3(d)(i)(E)(2)
shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or expiration of the type

described in either Section 3(d)(i)(E)(3) or 3(d)(i)(E)(4).

(F) No Increased Conversion Price. Notwithstanding any other
provisions of this Section 3(d)(i), except to the limited extent provided for in
Sections 3(d)(i)(E)(3) and 3(d)(i)(E)(4), no adjustment of the Applicable Conversion Price of any
series of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 3(d)(i) shall have the effect of increasing any
such Applicable Conversion Price.

(G) Waiver of Adjustment. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, any downward adjustment of the Applicable Conversion Price of any series of
Preferred Stock may be waived, either prospectively or retroactively and either generally or ina
particular instance, by the consent or vote of the holders of (1) a majority of the outstanding
shares of such series of Preferred Stock or (2) the Board (including the director elected by such
series of Preferred Stock, if any). Any such waiver shall bind all future holders of shares of such
series of Preferred Stock.

(ii) | Stock Splits and Dividends. In the event the Corporation should at any
time or from time to time after the Purchase Date fix a record date for the effectuation of a split
or subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or the determination of holders of
Common Stock entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of
Common Stock or other securities or rights convertible into, or entitling the holder thereof to
receive directly or indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock (hereinafter referred to as
“Common Stock Equivalents”) without payment of any consideration by such holder for the
additional shares of Common Stock or the Common Stock Equivalents (including the additional
shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof), then, as of such record
date (or the date of such dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no record date is fixed), the
Applicable Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock shall be appropriately decreased
so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of Preferred
Stock shall be increased in proportion to such increase of the aggregate of shares of Common
Stock outstanding and shares issuable with respect to Common Stock Equivalents, with the
number of shares issuable with respect to Common Stock Equivalents determined from time to
time in the manner provided for deemed issuances in Section 3(d)(i)(E).

61016-0004/LEGAL13103771.7 -8-
(iii) Reverse Stock Splits. Ifthe number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding at any time after the Purchase Date is decreased by a reverse split or combination of
the outstanding shares of Common Stock, then, following the record date of such reverse split or
combination, the Applicable Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock shall be
appropriately increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of
each share of Preferred Stock shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding
shares of Common Stock.

(e) Other Distributions

Subject to Section | above, in the event the Corporation shall declare a distribution
payable in securitics of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by the Corporation or
other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options, warrants or rights not referred to in
Section 3(d)(ii), then, in each such case for the purpose of this Section 3(e), the holders of
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any such distribution as though they
were the holders of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation into which their
shares of Preferred Stock are convertible as of the record date fixed for the determination of the
holders of Common Stock of the Corporation entitled to receive such distribution.

(f) Recapitalizations

If at any time or from time to time there shall be a recapitalization of the Common Stock
(other than a subdivision, combination or merger or sale of assets transaction provided for
elsewhere in this Section 3 or in Section 2), provision shall be made so that the holders each
series of Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive, upon conversion of such series of
Preferred Stock, the number of shares of capital stock or other securities or property of the
Corporation (or otherwise) to which a holder of the Common Stock deliverable upon conversion
of such series of Preferred Stock would have been entitled on such recapitalization if such
Common Stock had been outstanding at the time of such transaction. In any such case,
appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 3 with
respect to the rights of the holders of such series of Preferred Stock after the recapitalization to
the end that the provisions of this Section 3 (including adjustment of the Applicable Conversion
Price for such series of Preferred Stock then in effect and the number of shares issuable upon
conversion of such series of Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event and be as nearly
equivalent as practicable.

(g) No Fractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments

(i) No fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of any share or
shares of Preferred Stock, and the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued shall be
rounded to the nearest whole share. With respect to any fraction of a share called for upon the
conversion of Preferred Stock, an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the then current
Applicable Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock shall be paid in cash to the holder
otherwise entitled to receive such fractional shares, unless such payment is waived by the holders
of at least 60% of the outstanding Preferred Stock voting together as a single voting group on an
As Converted Basis (at a meeting or by written consent). The number of shares issuable to each
holder upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of

61016-0004/LEGAL!3 10377 1.7 -9-
such series of Preferred Stock that the holder is at the time converting into Common Stock and
the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such aggregate conversion.

(ii) | Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the Applicable
Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 3, the Corporation, at
its expense, shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the
terms hereof and prepare and furnish to each holder of such series of Preferred Stock a certificate
setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such
adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon the written request at any time
of any holder of such series of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a
like certificate setting forth (A) such adjustment and readjustment, (B) the Applicable
Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock at the time in effect, and (C) the number of
shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be
received upon the conversion of a share of such series of Preferred Stock.

(h) Reservation of Stock Issuable upon Conversion

The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but
unissued shares of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the
shares of Preferred Stock, such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time
be sufficient to effect the conversion of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock. If at any time
the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect
the conversion of all then outstanding shares of Preferred stock, the Corporation shall take such
corporate action as may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common
Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including without
limitation engaging in reasonable efforts to obtain the requisite shareholder approval of any
necessary amendment to the Corporation's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation.

(i) Status of Converted or Repurchased Stock

In the event any shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted pursuant to Section 3
hereof, or otherwise redeemed, purchased or acquired by the Corporation, the shares so
converted, redeemed, repurchased or acquired shal! be canceled and cease to be authorized and
shall not be re-issuable by the Corporation.

Gi) Reserved.
(k) Notices of Record Date

In the event of any taking by the Corporation of a record of the holders of any class of
securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof who are entitled to (i) receive any
dividend or other distribution, (ii) receive any right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise
acquire any shares of stock of any class or any other securities or property, (iii) vote to approve a
transaction effecting any reclassification or recapitalization of the Corporation's outstanding
capita] stock or (iv) vote to approve the voluntarily liquidation or dissolution of the Corporation
or any transaction deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation

Stock, at least ten (10) days prior to the date specified therein, a notice specifying the date on

61016-0004/LEGAL13103771.7 -10-
which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or right, and
the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right. The notice provisions set forth
in this Section may be shortened or waived prospectively or retrospectively by the consent or
vote of the holders of at least 60% of the Preferred Stock, voting together as a single voting
group on an As Converted Basis.

() Notices

Any notice required by the provisions of this Section 3 to be given to the holders of
shares of Preferred Stock shall given in accordance with Section 2.5 of the Corporation's Bylaws.

4, Protective Covenants

In addition to any other shareholder vote that may be required by law, the Corporation
shall not take any of the following actions (by amendment, merger, consolidation or otherwise)
without the written consent or affirmative vote of the holders of at least 60% of the then
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (voting together as a single voting group on an As
Converted Basis):

(a) | Amend the Rights and Preferences of any series of Preferred Stock in a manner
adverse to the holders thereof;

(b) Increase or decrease the total authorized shares of Common Stock or Preferred
Stock (other than decreases resulting from the conversion of Preferred Stock into Common Stock

(d) | Amend the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the
Corporation in a manner adverse to the holders of Preferred Stock,
