the Company at its principal corporate office, of the election to convert the same and shall state
therein the name or names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock are
to be issued (a Preferred Holder may not effect a transfer of shares pursuant to a conversion
unless all applicable restrictions on transfer are complied with.) The Company shall, as soon as

or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of

Common Stock’s fair market value determined in good faith by the Board as of the date of

of Preferred Stock. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to
the close of business on the date of such surrender of the certificate or certificates representing

shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the
record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock as of such date.

Series 5 Preferred, Series 4 Preferred, the Series 3 Preferred or Series 2 Preferred (together, the
“Senior Preferred’), as applicable in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional
Stock, then the applicable Conversion Price of the applicable series of Senior Preferred in effect
immediately prior to each such issuance shall (except as otherwise provided in this clause (i)) be
determined by dividing (X) an amount equal to the sum of (a) the product derived by multiplying
the applicable Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance times the number of
shares of Common Stock (including shares of Common Stock deemed to have becn issued upon
conversion of the outstanding Preferred Stock or otherwise under Section 3.3(i)(E)) outstanding

Senior Preferred shall have the effect of increasing the applicable Conversion Price of the Senior

Preferred above the applicable Conversion Price of the Scnior Preferred in effect immediately
prior to such adjustment.

(C) In the case of the issuance of Common Stock for cash, the
consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid thercfor before deducting any

Common Stock or options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or
exchangeable securitics (where the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such
options or rights or upon conversion or exchange of'such securities are not excluded from the
definition of Additional Stock), the following provisions shall apply:

(1) the aggregate maximum number of shares of Common
