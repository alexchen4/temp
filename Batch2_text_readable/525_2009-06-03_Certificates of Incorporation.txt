surviving or resulting corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary of another corporation
immediately following such merger or consolidation, the parent corporation of such surviving or

wholly owned subsidiary of the Corporation.

3,3. Conversion. The holders of Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as
follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Series A Preferred shall be convertible at
the option of the holder thereof at any time after the date of issuance and without the payment of
any additional consideration therefor into that number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Common Stock as is determined by dividing $1.68 (appropriately adjusted to take account of any
stock split, stock dividend, subdivision, combination of shares, or the like) in the case of shares
of Series A Preferred, $1.848 (appropriately adjusted to take account of any stock split, stock
dividend, subdivision, combination of shares, or the like) in the case of shares of Series A-1
Preferred, and $0.75 (appropriately adjusted to take account of any stock split, stock dividend,
subdivision, combination of shares or the like) in the case of shares of each of Series A-2
Preferred, Series A-3 Preferred and Series A-4 Preferred by the Conversion Price of the Series A
Preferred, Series A-1 Preferred, Series A-2 Preferred, Series A-3 Preferred or Series A-4
Preferred respectively, in effect at the time of conversion. The Conversion Price of the Series A
Preferred as of the Original Issue Date shall be $0.56, the Conversion Price of the Series A-1
Preferred as of the Original Issue Date shall be $0.616 and the Conversion Price of each of the
Series A-2 Preferred, Series A-3 Preferred and Series A-4 Preferred as of the Original Issue Date
shall be $0.75. Each Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment (in order to adjust the
number of shares of Common Stock into which shares of the applicable series of Preferred Stock
are convertible) as hereinafter provided. Each person so converting shares of Preferred Stock
shal! be entitled to all declared but unpaid dividends applicable to such shares of Preferred Stock
up to the time of the conversion thereof. Such dividends shall be paid to such person within
thirty (30) days of the date of conversion of such shares.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically
be converted into shares of Common Stock at the then effective Conversion Price for such share
of Preferred Stock upon:

(i) the closing of a firm commitment underwritten public offering
pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
covering the offer and sale of the Company’s Common Stock to the public, for the account of the
Company, at a public offering price of at least $2.25 per share, with such amount to be
appropriately adjusted to take account of any stock split, stock dividend, subdivision,
combination of shares, or the like, and having an aggregate offering price to the public of not less
than $40,000,000; or

, (ii) the written consent of the holders of at least two-thirds in voting
power of the Preferred Stock outstanding at that time.

The person(s) entitled to receive Common Stock issuable upon a conversion of shares of
Preferred Stock hereunder shall not be deemed to have converted such shares of Preferred Stock
until immediately prior to the closing of such offering or the receipt by the Corporation of such
consent (or, if later, the effective date for conversion specified in such written consent). Each
person who holds of record shares of Preferred Stock immediately prior to an automatic
conversion shall be entitled to all declared but unpaid dividends up to the time of the automatic
conversion. Such dividends shall be paid to all such holders within thirty (30) days of the
automatic conversion.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be
issued upon conversion of shares of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which a
holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction
multiplied by the then effective applicable Conversion Price. Before any holder of shares of
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into full shares of Common Stock, such
holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the
Corporation or of any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the
Corporation at such office that such holder elects to convert the same and shall state therein his
name or the name or names of his nominees in which such holder wishes the certificate or
certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued, together with the applicable federal
taxpayer identification number. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue
and deliver at such office to such holder of shares of Preferred Stock, or to his nominee or
nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which he
shall be entitled, together with cash in lieu of any fraction of a share. Subject to Section 3.3(b)
above, such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of
business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the
person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion shall
be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on
such date.

(d) Adjustments to Conversion Price for Diluting Issues:

(i) Special Definitions. For purposes of Section 3.3(d) and Section
3.4, the following definitions shall apply:

dividend or distribution on shares of Preferred Stock;

other entity in a transaction approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors.

(ii) No Adjustment of Conversion Price. No adjustment in the number
of shares of Common Stock into which a particular series of Preferred Stock is convertible shall
be made by adjustment in the Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock in respect of the
issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock or otherwise, (A) unless the consideration per
share for such Additional Shares of Common Stock issued or deemed to be issued by the
Corporation is less than the Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock in effect on the
date of, and immediately prior to, the issue of such Additional Shares of Common Stock or (B) if
prior to such issuance or within twenty (20) days thereafter the Corporation receives notice from
the holders of at least two-thirds in voting power of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock
that no such adjustment in such Conversion Price shall be made.

(iii) Issue of Securities Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common
Stock.
() Options and Convertible Securities. In the event the Corporation

at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall issue any Options or
Convertible Securities or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of
securities entitled to receive any such Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum
number of shares (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto without regard to any provisions
contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) of Common Stock issuable upon
the exercise of such Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities and Options therefor, the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to be Additional Shares
of Common Stock issued as of the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shall have
been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, provided that Additional Shares of

Common Stock shall not be deemed to have been issued if such shares of Common Stock are
excluded from the definition of Additional Shares of Common Stock set forth in Section
3.3(d)(i)(4); and provided, however, that in any such case in which Additional Shares of
Common Stock are deemed to be issued:

(A)no further adjustment in any Conversion Price shall be made upon
the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities or shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of
such Options or conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities,

(B) if such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms provide,
with the passage of time or otherwise, for any increase in the consideration payable to the
Corporation, or decrease in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable, upon the exercise,
conversion or exchange thereof, the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock computed
upon the original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and
any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon any such increase or decrease becoming
effective, be recomputed to reflect such increase or decrease insofar as it affects such Options or
the rights of conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities,

(C) upon the expiration of any such Options or any rights of

_ conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have been exercised,
the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock computed upon the original issue thereof
(or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto) and any subsequent adjustments
based thereon shall, upon such expiration, be recomputed as if:

(i) in the case of Convertible Securities or Options for
Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common Stock issued were the shares of
Common Stock, if any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities and the consideration received therefor was the
consideration actually received by the Corporation for the issue of all such Options, whether or
not exercised, plus the consideration actually received by the Corporation upon such exercise, or
for the issue of all such Convertible Securities which were actually converted or exchanged, plus
the additional consideration, if any, actually received by the Corporation upon such conversion
or exchange, and

(ii) in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, only the
Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were issued at the time of
issue of such Options, and the consideration received by the Corporation for the Additional
Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been then issued was the consideration actually
received by the Corporation for the issue of all such Options, whether or not exercised, plus the
consideration deemed to have been received by the Corporation (determined pursuant to Section
3,3(d)(v)) upon the issue of the Convertible Securities with respect to which such Options were
actually exercised;

(D) no readjustment pursuant to clause (B) or (C) above shall have the
effect of increasing the Conversion Price of either series of Preferred Stock to an amount which
exceeds the lower of (i) the Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock on the original
adjustment date, or (ii) the Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock that would have

resulted from any other issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock between the original
adjustment date and such readjustment date;

(E) in the case of any Options which expire by their terms not more
than thirty (30) days after the date of issue thereof, no adjustment of the Conversion Price of
either series of Preferred Stock shall be made until the expiration or exercise of all such Options,
whereupon such adjustment shall be made in the same manner provided in clause (C) above; and

(F) if such record date shall have been fixed and such Options or
Convertible Securities are not issued on the date fixed therefor, the adjustment previously made
in the Conversion Price of either series of Preferred Stock which became effective on such
record date shall be canceled as of the close of business on such record date, and thereafter the
Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock shall be adjusted pursuant to this Section
3.3(d)(iii) as of the actual date of their issuance.

(2) Stock Dividends, Stock Distributions and Subdivisions. In the
event the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall declare
or pay any dividend or make any other distribution on the Common Stock payable in Common
Stock, or effect a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or
otherwise than by payment of a dividend in Common Stock), then and in any such event,
Additional Shares of Common Stock shall not be deemed to have been issued, but the
Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock shall be adjusted in accordance with Section

3.3(d)(vi).

(iv) Adjustment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional
Shares of Common Stock. In the event the Corporation shall issue Additional Shares of
Common Stock (including Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to
Section 3.3(d)(iii)) without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the
Conversion Price of a particular series of Preferred Stock in effect on the date of and
immediately prior to such issue, then and in such event, such Conversion Price shall be reduced,
concurrently with such issue in order to increase the number of shares of Common Stock into
which such series of Preferred Stock is convertible, to a price (calculated to the nearest cent)
determined by dividing (A) (i) such Conversion Price multiplied by the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue (including shares of Common Stock
issuable upon conversion of any outstanding Options, Convertible Securities and shares of
Preferred Stock), plus (ii) the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for the total
number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued, by (B) (i) the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue (including shares of Common Stock
issuable upon conversion of any outstanding Options, Convertible Securities and shares of
Preferred Stock), plus (ii) the total number of such Additional Shares of Common Stock so
issued, provided that such Conversion Price shall not be so reduced at such time if the amount of
such reduction would be an amount less than $0.01, but any such amount shall be carried
forward and any reduction with respect thereto shall be made at the time of and together with any
subsequent reduction which, together with such amount and any other amount or amounts so
carried forward, shall aggregate $0.01 or more.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this Section
3.3(d), the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional Shares of
Common Stock shall be computed as follows:

(1) Cash and Property. Such consideration shall:

(A) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the aggregate amount
of cash received by the Corporation excluding amounts paid or payable for accrued interest or
accrued dividends;

(B) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be computed at
the fair value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors; and )

(C) in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock are issued
together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for consideration which
covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in
clauses (A) and (B) above, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(2) Options and Convertible Securities. The aggregate consideration
received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been
issued pursuant to Section 3.3(d)(iii)(1), relating to Options and Convertible Securities, shall be
determined by computing the total arnount, if any, received or receivable by the Corporation as
consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the minimum
aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto,
without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such
consideration until such subsequent adjustment occurs) payable to the Corporation upon the
exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities or in the
case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options for Convertible
Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities. The total number of
Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued shall be determined by calculating the maximum
number of shares of Common Stock (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without
regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number until such
subsequent adjustment occurs) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities.

(vi) Adjustment for Dividends, Distributions, Subdivisions
Combinations or Consolidation of Common Stock.

SOMDHIAnUS Uh Oe

(1) Stock Dividends, Distributions or Subdivisions. In the event the
Corporation at any time, or from time to time, shall declare or pay any dividend or make any
other distribution on the Common Stock payable in Common Stock, or effect a subdivision of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a
dividend in Common Stock), the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock in effect
immediately prior to such stock dividend, stock distribution or subdivision shall, concurrently
with the effectiveness of such stock dividend, stock distribution or subdivision, be
proportionately decreased.

(2) Combinations or Consolidations. In the event the outstanding
shares of Common Stock shall be combined or consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise,
into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price of each series of
Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such combination or consolidation shall,
concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination or consolidation, be proportionately
increased.

(vii) Adjustment for Merger or Reorganization. Subject to the
provisions of Section 3.2(d), in case of any consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or
into another corporation or the conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Corporation to another corporation in which the holders of Common Stock will be entitled to
receive shares of stock, other securities or property, each share of each series of Preferred Stock
shall thereafter be convertible into the number of shares of stock or other securities or property to
which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation deliverable upon
conversion of such share of Preferred Stock would have been entitled upon such consolidation,
merger or conveyance. In any such case, appropriate adjustment (as determined by the Board of
Directors) shall be made in the application of these provisions set forth with respect to the rights
and interest thereafter of the holders of Preferred Stock, to the end that these provisions
(including provisions with respect to changes in and other adjustments of the Conversion Prices)
shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any shares of stock
or other property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of Preferred Stock.

(ce) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of any Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 3.3, the Corporation at its expense
shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with these terms and
furnish to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment, readjustment
or conversion and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment, readjustment or
conversion is based, provided that the failure to promptly provide such notice shall not affect the
effectiveness of such adjustment, readjustment or conversion. The Corporation shall, upon the
__written request at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to
such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and readjustments, (ii) each
Conversion Price at the time in effect, and (iii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the
amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon the conversion of a
share of each series of Preferred Stock.

(f) Notices of Record Date. In the event of (i) any taking by the Corporation
of a record date of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the
holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend which is the
same as cash dividends paid in previous quarters) or other distribution, or (ii) any capital
reorganization of the Corporation, any reclassification or recapitalization of the capital stock of
the Corporation, any merger or consolidation of the Corporation, and any transfer of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Corporation to any other corporation, or any other entity or
person, or any voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Corporation,
the Corporation shall, unless waived by the holders of at least two-thirds in voting power of
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, mail to each holder of Preferred Stock at least 30 days
prior to the record date specified therein, a notice specifying (A) the date on which any such
record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend or distribution and a description of such

10
dividend or distribution, (B) the date on which any such reorganization, reclassification, transfer,
consolidation, merger, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to become effective,
and (C) the time, if any, that is to be fixed, as to when the holders of record of Common Stock
(or other securities) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock (or other
securities) for securities or other property deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification,
transfer, consolidation, merger, dissolution, liquidation or winding up.

(g) | Common Stock Reserved. The Corporation shall reserve and keep
available out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock such number of shares of Common
Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect conversion of the Preferred Stock.

3.4. Redemption.

(a) On June 4, 2014 and on each of the first and second anniversaries thereof
(each such date being referred to hereinafter as a “Redemption Date”), upon the demand of the
holders of at least two-thirds in voting power of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock,
the Corporation shall redeem from each such holder of shares of Preferred Stock, at the
applicable Redemption Price (as defined below), the following respective portions of the number
of shares of each series of Preferred Stock held by such holder on the applicable Redemption
Date:

Preferred Stock to be Redeemed

For the purposes of this Section 3.4, the term “Redemption Price” means a price per share equal
to, (i) in the case of the Series A Preferred, the sum of (x) $1.68 (subject to appropriate
adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other similar
recapitalization affecting such shares) plus (y) any dividends declared but unpaid thereon, (ii) in
the case of the Series A-1 Preferred, the sum of (x) $1.848 (subject to appropriate adjustment in
the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization
affecting such shares) plus (y) any dividends declared but unpaid thereon, and (iii) in the case of
each of the Series A-2 Preferred, Series A-3 Preferred and Series A-4 Preferred, the sum of (x)
$0.75 (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split,
combination or other similar recapitalization affecting such shares) plus (y) any dividends
declared but unpaid thereon.

(b) If the funds of the Corporation legally available for redemption of the
Preferred Stock on any Redemption Date are insufficient to redeem the number of shares of
Preferred Stock required under this Section 3 to be redeemed on such date, those funds which are
legally available will be used to redeem the maximum possible number of such shares ratably on

11

the basis of the number of shares of each series of Preferred Stock which would be redeemed on
such date if the funds of the Corporation legally available therefor had been sufficient to redeem
all the shares of Preferred Stock required to be tedeemed on such date. At any time thereafter
when additional funds of the Corporation become legally available for the redemption of the
Preferred Stock, such funds will be used, at the end of the next succeeding fiscal quarter, to
redeem the balance of the shares which the Corporation was theretofore obligated to redeem,
ratably on the basis set forth in the preceding sentence.

(c) Unless there shall have been a default in payment of the applicable
redemption price, no share of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to any dividends declared after its
applicable redemption date, and on such redemption date all rights of the holder of such shares as
a stockholder of the Corporation by reason of the ownership of such share will cease, except the
right to receive the applicable Redemption Price of such share, upon presentation and surrender
of the certificate representing such share and such share will not from and after such redemption
date be deemed to be outstanding.

3.5. Voting Rights.

(a) | Onany matter presented to the stockholders of the Corporation for their
action or consideration at any meeting of stockholders of the Corporation (or by written consent
of stockholders in lieu of meeting), each holder of outstanding shares of each series of Preferred
Stock shall be entitled to cast the number of votes equal to the number of whole shares of
Common Stock into which the shares of such series of Preferred Stock held by such holder are
convertible as of the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote on such matter.
Except as provided by law or by the provisions of Section 3.5(b), Section 3.5(c) or Section 3.7,
