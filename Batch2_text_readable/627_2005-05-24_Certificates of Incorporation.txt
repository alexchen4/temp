shares of Series E Preferred Stock and Scrics F Parity Stock without first making distributions in
respect of liquidation in full on the shares of Series E Senior Stock, if any, and no distribuiion
shall be made on the share of Serics E Junior Stock without first making distributions on the
shares of Scrics E Preferred Stock and Series E Parity Stock, if any, equal to the amount of the
Series E Sales Price per share for each share of Series E Preferred Stock plus declared but unpaid
cividends and the applicable liquidation preference for each share of Series E Parity Stock, in
each case as adjusted for any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Series E Preferred Stock or Series E Panty

like change with respect to the Scries E Preferred Stock or Serics E Parity Stock, as the case may
be, occurring on or after the date the shares of Series E Preferred Stock or Series E Parity Stock,

holders of Series E Junior Stock, if any, other than Common Stock, and then allocated among the
holders of the Common Stock in pruportion to the numbers of shares held by such holders.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any holder of a future class or series of the Corporation's
capital stock is permnitted to participate with Serics E Junior Stock in the distribution of any
assets remaining after the holders of such class or series of capital stock (of each series then
outstanding) have been paid their liquidation preference, if any, then the holders of the Series E
Preferred Stock shall also be permitted to participate in such distribution in proportion to the
number of shares of Common Stock, determined on an as-converted basis, held by such ho!ders.
If upon occurrence of such event the assets and property thus distributed among the holders of
the Series E Preferred Stock and the Series E Parity Stock, if any, is insufficient to permit the
payment to such holders of the full preferential amount, then the cntire assets and property of the
Corporation legally available for distribution shall, subject to the prior payment in full of
distributions in respect of liquidation on shares of Scrics E Senior Stock, be distributed ratably
among the holders of the Series E Preferred Stock and the Series E Parity Stock, such that the
same percentage of the following amounts is paid on each share of Series E Preferred Stock and
Series E Parity Stock: the sum of the Series E Sales Price and declared but unpaid dividends on
Series E Preferred Stock and the applicable liquidation preference of and declared and unpaid
dividends on the Series E Parity Stock. A Merger or Asset Sale (each as defined herein) shall be

number of fully-paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock that is equal to the Series E
Sales Price divided by the Series E Conversion Price multiplied by the number of shares of
Series E Preferred Stock to be converted. The “Series E Conversion Price’ for the Series E
Preferred Stock shall initially be the Series E Sales Price, and shall be subject to adjustment as
provided herein. The number of shares of Common Stock into which each share of Series E
Preferred Stock may be converted is hereinafter referred to as the “Series E Conversion Rate.”

(ii) Mechanics of Conversion. Each holder of Series E
Preferred Stock that desires to convert such shares into shares of Common Stock pursuant to this
paragraph 5(a) shall surrender the certificate or certiicates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office

Corporation shall promptly issue and deliver at such office to such holder a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled. Such
conversion shall be deemed to have been made at the close of business on the date of such
surrender of the certificates representing the shares of Series E Preferred Stock to be converted,

Common Stock as shall be sufficient to effect the conversion of all shares of Series E Preferred
Stock from time to time outstanding, and the Corporation shall obtain and keep in force such
permits as may be required in order to enable the Corporation lawfully to issue and deliver such
number of shares of Common Stock. On conversion, no fractional shares of Common Stock

the Board in good faith.

paragraph, the value of equity shall be determined in good faith by the Board whose
determination shall be binding and conclusive.

(iii) | Conversion of a Majority of Series E Preferred Shares. At
such time as more than 50% of the aggregate number of shares of Series E Preferred Stock has

any rights of conversion or exchange under such convertible securities which shall not
have been exercised, the Series E Conversion Price, computed upon the original issue
thereot (ar upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thercto) and any subsequent
adjustments based thereon shall, upon such expiration, be recomputed as if:

i) in the case of convertible securities
or options for Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common issued
were the shares of Common Stock, if any, actually issued upon the exercise of
such options or the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities and the
consideration received therefor was the consideration actually received by the
Corporation for the issue of such exercised options plus the consideration actually
received by the Corporation upon such exercise or for the issue of all such
convertible securities which were actually converted or exchanged, plus the
additional consideration, if any, actually received by the Corporation upon such
conversion or exchange, and

ii) in the case of options for convertible

then and in such event, the Series E Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently with such
issue (the “Series E Weighted Average Antidilution’), to a price (calculated to the nearest cent)
determined by multiplying the Series E Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which
shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before such issue plus
the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration received by the
Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of Common so issued would purchase at
such Scries E Conversion Price, and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of
“ommon Sisck vutstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of such Additional

Additional Shares of Common shall be deemed to be outstanding. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the holders of shares in a future class or series of the Corporation’s capital stock
have a conversion price adjustment upon the issuance of Additional Shares of Common such that
the conversion price applicable to such shares of capital stock is equal to the quotiert of the
aggregate consideration received for the Additional Shares of Common divided by the number of
Additional Shares of Common (“Ratchet Antidilution’’), then the holders of Series E Preferred
Stock shall have the Series E Conversion Price adjusted for such Ratchet Antidilution rights as to
any Additional Shares of Common rather than the Series E Weighted Average Antidilution rights
described above.

(v) Adjustments for Subdivisions, Splits _ Combinations,
Consolidations, Reorganizations or Reclassifications of Common Stock. In the event that after

the holder would have been entitled iad the holder held, at the time of said split, subdivision,
combination, consolidation, reorganization or reclassification, the number of shares of Common
Stock into which Series E Preferred Stock could have converted immediately prior to such event.

event the Corporation at any time after the date of the first issuance of the Series E Preferred
Stock makes, or fixes a record date for, the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled

number of shares of Common Stock receivable thereupon, the stock or securities to which the
holder would have been entitled had the holder held, at the time of said dividend or other
distribution, the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Series E Preferred Stock
could have converted immediately prior to such event, and had such holders thereafter during the
period from the date of such event to and including the date of conversion, retained such stock or
securities receivabie by such holders as aforesaid during such period, subject to all other
