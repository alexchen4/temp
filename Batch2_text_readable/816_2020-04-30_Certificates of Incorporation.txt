3. Liquidation Rights.

(a) Liquidation Preference. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation, either voluntary or involuntary, the assets and funds of the
Corporation shall be distributed as follows:

(i) The holders of the Series D Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred
Stock shall be entitled to receive pari passu and prior and in preference to any Distribution to the

GDS VF&H\5016 145.6
holders of the Common Stock and Nonvoting Common Stock by reason of their ownership of
such stock, an amount per share for (A) each share of Series C Preferred Stock held by them
equal to the sum of (1) the Liquidation Preference specified for such share of Series C Preferred
Stock and (ii) all declared but unpaid dividends (if any) on such share of Series C Preferred
Stock, and (B) each share of Series D Preferred Stock held by them equal to the sum of (1) the
Liquidation Preference specified for such share of Series D Preferred Stock and (11) all declared
but unpaid dividends (if any) on such share of Series D Preferred Stock. If upon the liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the assets of the Corporation legally available for
distribution to the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock are
insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full amounts specified in this Section
3(a)(i), then the entire assets of the Corporation legally available for distribution shall be
distributed with equal priority and pro rata among the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock
and Series C Preferred Stock in proportion to the full amounts they would otherwise be entitled
to receive pursuant to this Section 3(a)(j).

(ii) | Remaining Assets. After the payment or setting aside for payment
to the holders of Preferred Stock of the full amounts specified in Section 3(a)(i) above, the entire
remaining assets of the Corporation legally available for distribution shall be distributed pro rata
to holders of the Common Stock and Nonvoting Common Stock of the Corporation in proportion
to the number of shares of Common Stock and Nonvoting Common Stock held by them.

(b) Deemed Conversion to Common Stock. Notwithstanding the provisions
set forth in Section 3(a)(i) hereof, in determining the amount that each holder of each Series of
Preferred Stock is entitled to receive upon a voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation, each holder of such Series shall be deemed to have converted all
shares of such Series into shares of Common Stock, effective immediately prior to such
voluntary or involuntary liquidation dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation (regardless of
whether such holder actually converted such shares) and at the Conversion Price then applicable
to such Series, if and to the extent that, as a result of an actual conversion of the shares of such
Series (as well as the assumed conversion of shares of any other Series that such holder would be
deemed to have converted pursuant to this Section 3(b)), such holder would receive an aggregate
amount greater than the aggregate amount that would be distributed to such holder in respect of
such Series pursuant to Section 3(a)(i) hereof, as applicable, if such holder did not convert shares
of such Series into shares of Common Stock. If any such holder shall be deemed to have
converted any of its shares of Preferred Stock into Common Stock pursuant to this paragraph,
such holder shall be entitled to share ratably in the distribution of assets to the holders of
Common Stock in respect of such shares upon such voluntary or involuntary liquidation,
dissolution or winding up, and shall not be entitled to receive a Distribution that would otherwise
be made to such holder in respect of such shares pursuant to Section 3(a)(i) hereof.

(c) Reorganization. For purposes of this Section 3, a liquidation, dissolution
or winding up of the Corporation shall be deemed to be occasioned by and to include a “Change
of Control.” A “Change of Control” shall mean (A) a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of
the Corporation or any subsidiary or subsidiaries of the Corporation that include all or
substantially all of the assets of the Corporation and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, at law,
whether voluntary or involuntary, (B) the consummation of the merger, combination or
consolidation of the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation (in which the Corporation

GDS VF &H\5016 145.6
issues shares of its capital stock pursuant to such merger, combination or consolidation) with or
into any other corporation, limited liability company or other entity (or a group of corporations,
limited liability companies or other entities) (except a merger or consolidation in which the
holders of capital stock of the Corporation immediately prior to such merger or consolidation
continue to hold (solely in respect of their interests in the Corporation’s capital stock
immediately prior to such merger, combination or consolidation) a majority of the voting power
of the capital stock of the Corporation or the surviving or acquiring entity); (C) the closing of the
transfer or issuance (whether by merger, combination, consolidation or otherwise), in one
transaction or a series of related transactions to which the Corporation or a subsidiary of the
Corporation is a party, to a corporation, person or group of affiliated persons (other than an
underwriter of the Corporation’s securities), of the Corporation’s securities if, after such closing,
such person or group of affiliated persons would hold 50% or more in voting interest of the
outstanding voting stock of the Corporation (other than a transfer or issuance effected primarily
for purposes of raising capital for the Corporation or its subsidiaries) or (D) a sale, lease,
exclusive license, assignment, transfer or disposal of all or substantially all of the assets or
intellectual property of the Corporation and its subsidiaries taken as a whole (other than (1) a
pledge ofassets or grant ofa security interest therein to a commercial lender in connection with a
commercial lending or similar transaction or (2) a sale, lease, exclusive license, assignment,
transfer or disposal to a corporation, limited liability company or other entity (or a group of
corporations, limited liability companies or other entities) in which the holders of capital stock of
the Corporation immediately prior to such sale, lease, exclusive license, assignment, transfer or
disposal continue to hold (solely in respect of their interests in the Corporation’s capital stock
immediately prior to such transaction) a majority of the aggregate voting power of the capital
stock of the acquiring entity or entities)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the treatment of any
particular transaction or series of related transactions as a liquidation, dissolution or winding up
of the Corporation (including a “Change of Control”) may be waived (i) by the vote or written
consent of the holders of at least fifty-one percent (51%) of the then outstanding Preferred Stock
(voting together as a single class and on an as-converted to Common Stock basis), and (ii) solely
with respect to Series D Preferred Stock, by the vote or written consent of the holders of at least
a majority of the then outstanding Series D Preferred Stock.

(d) Valuation of Non-Cash Consideration. If any assets of the Corporation
distributed to stockholders in connection with any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the
Corporation are other than cash, then the value of such assets shall be their fair market value as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, except that any publicly traded securities to
be distributed to stockholders in a liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation shall
be valued as follows:

(i) If the securities are than traded on a national securities exchange or
the Nasdaq Stock Market (or a similar national quotation system), then the value of the securities
shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange or
system over the ten (10) trading day period ending five (5) trading days prior to the Distribution;

(ii) if the securities are actively traded over-the-counter, then the value

of the securities shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid prices of the securities over
the ten (10) trading day period ending five (5) trading days prior to the Distribution.

GDS VF &H\5016 145.6
In the event of a merger or other acquisition of the Corporation by another entity, the
Distribution date shall be deemed to be the date such transaction closes.

For the purposes of this subsection 3(d), “trading day” shall mean any day which the
exchange or system on which the securities to be distributed are traded is open and “closing
prices” or “closing bid prices” shall be deemed to be: (i) for securities traded primarily on the
New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, the last reported trade
price or sale price, as the case may be, at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on that day and (ii) for
securities listed or traded on other exchanges, markets and systems, the market price as of the
end of the regular hours trading period that is generally accepted as such for such exchange,
market or system. If, after the date hereof, the benchmark times generally accepted in the
securities industry for determining the market price of a stock as of a given trading day shall
change from those set forth above, the fair market value shall be determined as of such other
generally accepted benchmark times. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the consideration
received by the Corporation or the proceeds to be distributed to holders of shares of the
Corporation’s capital stock is other than cash and the definitive merger agreement, asset
purchase agreement or other definitive transaction document entered into with respect to a
transaction or transactions constituting a Change of Control specifies an alternative method of
determining the value of such consideration or proceeds, then, for the purpose of this
Section 3(d), the value of such consideration or proceeds shall be determined in accordance with
the method set forth in such merger agreement, asset purchase agreement of other definitive
transaction document, as applicable.

4. Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock and Nonvoting Common Stock
shall have conversion rights as follows:

(a) Right to Convert.

(i) Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of
the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share at the office of the
Corporation or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, into that number of fully-paid,
nonassessable shares of Common Stock determined by dividing the Original Issue Price for the
relevant Series by the Conversion Price for such series. In addition, each share of Series D
Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date
of issuance of such share at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for the Series D
Preferred Stock, into that number of fully-paid, nonassessable shares of Nonvoting Common
Stock determined by dividing the Original Issue Price by the Conversion Price of the Series D
Preferred Stock. The number of shares of Common Stock or Nonvoting Common Stock, as
applicable, into which each share of a Series of Preferred Stock may be converted is hereinafter
referred to as the “Conversion Rate” for each such Series. Upon any decrease or increase in the
Conversion Price for any Series of Preferred Stock, as described in this Section 4, the
Conversion Rate for such Series shall be appropriately increased or decreased.

(ii) | Each share of Nonvoting Common Stock shall be convertible, at
the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share at the office
of the Corporation or any transfer agent for the Nonvoting Common Stock, into one fully-paid,
nonassessable share of Common Stock.

GDS VF &H\5016 145.6
(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Series C Preferred Stock shall
automatically be converted into fully-paid, non-assessable shares of Common Stock and each
share of Series D Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into fully-paid, non-
assessable shares of Nonvoting Common Stock, in each case at the then effective Conversion
Rate for such share (i) immediately prior to the closing of a firm commitment underwritten initial
public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), covering the offer and sale of the Common Stock,
provided that the aggregate gross offering proceeds to the Corporation are not less than
$300,000,000, or (ii) (A) with respect to the Series C Preferred Stock, upon the receipt by the
Corporation of a written request for such conversion from the holders of at least fifty-one percent
(51%) of the Series C Preferred Stock then outstanding (voting as a single class and on an as-
converted to Common Stock basis), or, if later, the effective date for conversion specified in such
requests, or (B) with respect to the Series D Preferred Stock, upon the receipt by the Corporation
of a written request for such conversion from the holders of at least fifty-one percent (51%) of
the Series D Preferred Stock then outstanding (voting as a single class and on an as-converted to
Common Stock basis), or, if later, the effective date for conversion specified in such requests
(each of the events referred to in (4) and (11) are referred to herein as an “Automatic Conversion
Event”); provided, however, prior to an Automatic Conversion Event, upon the receipt by the
Corporation of a written request from a holder of Series D Preferred Stock, all or any portion (as
specified in such written request) of the then outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock held
by such holder may instead convert into that number of fully-paid, nonassessable shares of
Common Stock.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of Common Stock or
Nonvoting Common Stock, as applicable, shall be issued upon conversion of Preferred Stock. In
lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation
shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the then fair market value of a share of
Common Stock or Nonvoting Common Stock, as applicable, as determined by the Board of
Directors. For such purpose, all shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder of Preferred Stock
shall be aggregated, and any resulting fractional share of Common Stock and/or Nonvoting
Common Stock, as applicable, shall be paid in cash. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall
be entitled to convert the same into full shares of Common Stock and/or Nonvoting Common
Stock, as applicable,, and to receive certificates therefor, he shall either (A) surrender the
certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any
transfer agent for the Preferred Stock or (B) notify the Corporation or its transfer agent that such
certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and execute an agreement satisfactory to the
Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such
certificates, and shall give written notice to the Corporation at such office that be elects to
convert the same; provided, however, that on the date of an Automatic Conversion Event, the
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically without any further action
by the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates representing such shares are
surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent; provided further, however, that the
Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock
or Nonvoting Common Stock, as applicable, issuable upon such Automatic Conversion Event
unless either the certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are delivered to the
Corporation or its transfer agent as provided above, or the holder notifies the Corporation or its
transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an

GDS VF&H15016 145.6
agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred
by it in connection with such certificates. On the date of the occurrence of an Automatic
Conversion Event, each holder of record of shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to be the
holder of record of the Common Stock or Nonvoting Common Stock, as applicable, issuable
upon such conversion, notwithstanding that the certificates representing such shares of Preferred
Stock shall not have been surrendered at the office of the Corporation, that notice from the
Corporation shall not have been received by any holder of record of shares of Preferred Stock, or
that the certificates evidencing such shares of Common Stock or Nonvoting Common Stock shall
not then be actually delivered to such holder.

The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after such delivery, or after such agreement
and indemnification, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, a
certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock and/or Nonvoting Common
Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid and a check payable to such holder in
the amount of any cash amounts payable as the result of a conversion into fractional shares of
Common Stock and/or Nonvoting Common Stock, plus any declared and unpaid dividends on
the converted Preferred Stock. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately
prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be
converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock and/or
Nonvoting Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the
record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock and/or Nonvoting Common Stock,
respectively, on such date; provided, however, that if the conversion is in connection with an
underwritten offer of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act or a merger, sale,
financing, or liquidation of the Corporation or ether event, the conversion may, at the option of
any holder tendering Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing of such
transaction or upon the occurrence of such event, in which case the person(s) entitled to receive
the Common Stock and/or Nonvoting Common Stock, issuable upon such conversion of the
Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately
prior to the closing of such transaction or the occurrence of such event.

(d) Adjustments to Conversion Price for Diluting Issues.

(i) Special Definition. For purposes of this paragraph 4(d),
“Additional Shares of Common” shall mean all shares of Common Stock issued (or, pursuant to

Redeemed Shares and Options is equal to or less than the gross price per share received by the
Corporation in connection with the corresponding financing transaction.

(ii) No Adjustment of Conversion Price; Tolling. No adjustment in the
Conversion Price of a particular Series of Preferred Stock shall be made in respect of the

issuance of Additional Shares of Common unless the consideration per share (as determined
pursuant to paragraph 4(d)(v)) for an Additional Share of Common issued or deemed to be
issued by the Corporation is less than the Conversion Price in effect on the date of, and
immediately prior to, such issue, for such Series of Preferred Stock. In addition, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth herein, in the event of an issuance or deemed issuance of shares
of Common Stock by the Corporation pursuant to paragraph 4(d)(i)(10), which will be followed

GDS VF&H\5016 145.6
by a repurchase and/or cancellation of Redeemed Shares and Options, no adjustment in the
Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock shall be made until the ninetieth (90") day
following such issuance of shares of Common Stock (the “Repurchase Tolling Date”). On the
Repurchase Tolling Date, the Corporation will determine the number of Redeemed Shares and
Options that have been repurchased and/or cancelled by the Corporation. If the number of
Redeemed Shares and Options repurchased and/or cancelled by the Corporation within the ninety
(90) days following the issuance or deemed issuance of shares of shares of Common Stock by
the Corporation pursuant to paragraph 4(d)(1)(10) is equal to or greater than the number of shares
of shares of Common Stock issued in connection with such transaction, no adjustment shall be
made to the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4,
provided, however, that if the number of Redeemed Shares and Options repurchased and/or
cancelled by the Corporation within the ninety (90) days following the issuance or deemed
issuance of shares of Common Stock by the Corporation pursuant to paragraph 4(d)(i)(10) is less
than the number of shares of Common Stock issued in connection with such transaction, the
positive difference between (x) the number of shares of Common Stock issued or deemed issued
pursuant to paragraph 4(d)(1)(10) and (y) the number of Redeemed Shares and Options actually
repurchased and/or cancelled prior to the Repurchase Tolling Date (the “Repurchase Shortfall
Shares’’) shall be deemed Additional Shares of Common for the purposes of this Section 4 and
each series of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to any applicable Conversion Price adjustment
pursuant to Section 4(d){iv) related to the issuance or deemed issuance of the Repurchase
Shortfall Shares (unless such adjustment is otherwise waived pursuant to Section 4(1)).

(iii) Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the date of the filing of this Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall issue any Options or Convertible Securities or shall
fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive any
such Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of shares (as set forth in the
instrument relating thereto without regard to any provisions contained therein for a subsequent
adjustment of such number) of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Options or, in
the case of Convertible Securities, the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities or,
in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options and the conversion
or exchange of the underlying securities, shall be deemed to have been issued as of the time of
such issue or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as ofthe close of business on such
record date, provided that in any such case in which shares are deemed to be issued:

(1) no further adjustment in the Conversion Price of any Series
of Preferred Stock shall be made upon the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities or shares of
Common Stock in connection with the exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of
such Convertible Securities;

(2) if such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms
provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any change in the consideration payable to the
Corporation or in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion
or exchange thereof (other than a change pursuant to the anti-dilution provisions of such Options
or Convertible Securities such as this Section 4(d) or pursuant to Recapitalization provisions of
such Options or Convertible Securities such as Sections 4(e), 4(f) and 4(g) hereof), the
Conversion Price of each Series of Preferred Stock and any subsequent adjustments based

GDS VF&H\5016 145.6
thereon shall be recomputed to reflect such change as if such change had been in effect as of the
original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of the record date with respect thereto);

(3) no readjustment pursuant to clause (2) above shall have the
effect of increasing the Conversion Price of a Series of Preferred Stock to an amount above the
Conversion Price that would have resulted from any other issuances of Additional Shares of
Common and any other adjustments provided for herein between the original adjustment date
and such readjustment date;

(4) upon the expiration of any such Options or any rights of
conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have been exercised,
the Conversion Price of each Series of Preferred Stock computed upon the original issue thereof
(or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto) and any subsequent adjustments
based thereon shall, upon such expiration, be recomputed as if:

(a) in the case of Convertible Securities or Options for
Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common issued were the shares of Common
Stock, if any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of
such Convertible Securities and the consideration received therefor was the consideration
actually received by the Corporation for the issue of such exercised Options plus the
consideration actually received by the Corporation upon such exercise or for the issue of all such
Convertible Securities which were actually converted or exchanged, plus the additional
consideration, if any, actually recetved by the Corporation upon such conversion or exchange,
and

(b) in the case of Options for Convertible Securities,
only the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were issued at
the time of issue of such Options, and the consideration received by the Corporation for the
Additional Shares of Common deemed to have been then issued was the consideration actually
received by the Corporation for the issue of such exercised Options, plus the consideration
deemed to have been received by the Corporation (determined pursuant to Section 4(d)(v)) upon
the issue of the Convertible Securities with respect to which such Options were actually
exercised; and

(5) if such record date shall have been fixed and such Options
or Convertible Securities are not issued on the date fixed therefor, the adjustment previously
made in the Conversion Price which became effective on such record date shall be canceled as of
the close of business on such record date, and thereafter the Conversion Price shall be adjusted
pursuant to this paragraph 4(d)(iii) as of the actual date of their issuance.

(iv) Adjustment _of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional
Shares of Common. In the event this Corporation shall issue Additional Shares of Common

Stock (including Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to paragraph
4(d)(iii)) without consideration or for a price per share less than the applicable Conversion Price
of a Series of Preferred Stock in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such issue, then,
the Conversion Price of the affected Series of Preferred Stock shall be reduced, concurrently
with such issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying such

GDS VF&HN016 145.6
Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of shares which the
aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of
Common so issued would purchase at such Conversion Price, and the denominator of which
shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus
the number of such Additional Shares of Common so issued. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Conversion Price shall not be reduced at such time if the amount of such reduction would be less
than $0.01, but any such amount shall be carried forward, and a reduction will be made with
respect to such amount at the time of, and together with, any subsequent reduction which,
together with such amount and any other amounts so carried forward, equal $0.01 or more in the
aggregate. For the purposes of this Subsection 4(d)(iv), all shares of Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock and the exercise and/or conversion
of any other outstanding Convertible Securities and all outstanding Options shall be deemed to
be outstanding.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this subsection
4(d), the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue (or deemed issue) of any
Additional Shares of Common shall be computed as follows:

(1) Cash and Property. Such consideration shall:

(a) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
aggregate amount of cash received by the Corporation before deducting any reasonable
discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the Corporation for any
underwriting or otherwise in connection with such issuance;

(b) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair market value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith
by the Board of Directors; and

(c) in the event Additional Shares of Common are
issued together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for consideration
which covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in
clauses (a) and (b) above, as reasonably determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(2) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per
share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common deemed to have been issued

pursuant to paragraph 4(d)(i11) shall be determined by dividing:

(a) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by
the Corporation as consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the
minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating
thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such
consideration) payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the
exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities by

GDS VF&H\5016 145.6
(b) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock
(as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein
for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities.

(e) Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of Common Stock. In the
event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided (by stock split, by payment

of a stock dividend or otherwise occurring after the date of the filing of this Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation) into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the
Conversion Price of each Series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such
subdivision shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such subdivision, be proportionately
decreased. In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined (by
reclassification or otherwise) into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion
Prices in effect immediately prior to such combination shall, concurrently with the effectiveness
of such combination, be proportionately increased. In the event the outstanding shares of
Common Stock shall be subdivided (by stock split, by payment of a stock dividend or otherwise
occurring after the date of the filing of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation)
into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the shares of Nonvoting Common Stock shall
be subdivided in the same fashion. In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall
be combined (by reclassification or otherwise) into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock,
the shares of Nonvoting Common Stock shall be combined in the same fashion.

(f) Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of Preferred Stock. In the
event the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock or a Series of Preferred Stock shall be subdivided

(by stock split, by payment of a stock dividend or otherwise occurring after the date of the filing
of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation) into a greater number of shares of
Preferred Stock, the Dividend Rate, Original Issue Price and Liquidation Preference of the
affected Series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall,
concurrently with the effectiveness of such subdivision, be proportionately decreased. In the
event the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock or a Series of Preferred Stock shall be combined
(by reclassification or otherwise) into a lesser number of shares of Preferred Stock, the Dividend
Rate, Original Issue Price and Liquidation Preference of the affected Series of Preferred Stock in
effect immediately prior to such combination shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such
combination, be proportionately increased.

(g) Adjustments for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. Subject to
Section 3 above (“Liquidation Rights”), if the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the

Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of any other class
or classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a
subdivision or combination of shares provided for above), then, in any such event, in lieu of the
number of shares of Common Stock which the holders would otherwise have been entitled to
receive, each holder of such Preferred Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such shares
of Preferred Stock into a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock which a holder
of the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of such Series of
Preferred Stock immediately before that change would have been entitled to receive in such
reorganization or reclassification, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein with
respect to such other shares.

GDS VF &H'5016 145.6
(h) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation at its expense
shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and
furnish to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or
readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is
based. The Corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of Preferred
Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such
adjustments and readjustments, (ii) the Conversion Price at the time in effect and (iii) the number
of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the tithe would be
received upon the conversion of Preferred Stock.

(i) Waiver of Adjustment of Conversion Price. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, any downward adjustment of the Conversion Price of any Series of
Preferred Stock may be waived (i) by the consent or vote of the holders of at least fifty-one
percent (51%) of the outstanding shares of such Series either before or after the issuance causing
the adjustment, and (ii) solely with respect to Series D Preferred Stock, by the vote or written
consent of the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding Series D Preferred Stock.

(j) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at
all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock

and Nonvoting Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares
of the Preferred Stock, such number of its shares of Common Stock and Nonvoting Common
Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding
shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of
Common Stock and Nonvoting Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of
all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate
action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock and Nonvoting Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be
sufficient for such purpose.

5, Voting.

(a) Restricted Class Voting. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or
as required by law, the holders of Preferred Stock and the holders of Common Stock and
Nonvoting Common Stock shall vote together and not as separate classes.

Stock shall have no voting rights on any matter relating to the election of the members of the
Board of Directors or the determination of the size of the Board of Directors on which the
stockholders of the Corporation shall be entitled to vote and the shares of Series D Preferred
Stock shall not be included in determining the number of shares voting or entitled to vote on any
such matters unless the applicable shares of Series D Preferred Stock are converted to Common
Stock pursuant to Article V, Section 4 herein (the “Series D Voting Restriction”). Subject to the

GDS VF&H\5016 145.6
Series D Voting Restriction, on any matter presented to the stockholders of the Corporation for
their action or consideration at any meeting of stockholders of the Corporation (or by written
consent of stockholders in lieu of meeting), each holder of Series C Preferred Stock and Series D
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of shares of
Common Stock into which the shares of Preferred Stock held by such holder could be converted
as of the record date. Subject to the Series D Voting Restriction, the holders of shares of the
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to vote on all matters on which the Common Stock shall be
entitled to vote. Holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to notice of any stockholders’
meeting in accordance with the Bylaws of the Corporation. Fractional votes shall not, however,
be permitted and any fractional voting rights resulting from the above formula (after aggregating
all shares into which shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder could be converted), shall be
disregarded.

(d) —_ Election of Directors. The holders of Common Stock, voting as a separate
class, shall be entitled to elect three (3) members of the Corporation’s Board of Directors at each
meeting or pursuant to each consent of the Corporation’s stockholders for the election of

Corporation’s Board of Directors shall be elected by the holders of Common Stock and Series C
Preferred Stock voting together as a single class. If a vacancy on the Board of Directors is to be
filled by the Board of Directors, only directors elected by the same class or classes of
stockholders as those who would he entitled to vote to fill such vacancy shall vote to fill such
vacancy.

(e) Adjustment in Authorized Common Stock and Authorized Nonvoting
Common Stock. Subject to Section 7 below, the number of authorized shares of Common Stock
and Nonvoting Common Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of
shares of Common Stock and Nonvoting Common Stock, respectively, then outstanding or
reserved for issuance) by an affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting interest of the
capital stock of the Corporation.

(f) Common Stock. Except as set forth in Section 5(g) each holder of shares
of Common Stock or Nonvoting Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share
thereof held.

(zg) Nonvoting Common Stock. Except as otherwise expressly provided
herein or as required by law, the holders of Nonvoting Common Stock shall, with respect to such
shares of Nonvoting Common Stock, have no voting rights on any matter relating to the election
of the members of the Board of Directors or the determination of the size of the Board of
Directors on which the stockholders of the Corporation shall be entitled to vote and the shares of
Nonvoting Common Stock shall not be included in determining the number of shares voting or
entitled to vote on any such matters.
