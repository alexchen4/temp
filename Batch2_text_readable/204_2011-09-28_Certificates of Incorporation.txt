Section 4. Conversion.
4.1 Conversion Procedure.

{a) At any time and from time to time, any holder of Series A Preferred
Shares, Scrics B Preferred Shares, Series C Preferred Shares or Series D Preferred Shares may
convert all or any portion of the Scrics A Preferred Shares, Serics B Preferred Shares, Series C
Preferred Shares or Scries D Preferred Shares (including any fraction of a share) held by such holder
into the number of shares of Common Stock obtained by (A) multiplying the number of Series A
Preferred Shares, Series B Preferred Shares, Series C Preferred Shares or Series D Preferred Shares
to be converted by the Series A Liquidation Value, Series B Liquidation Valuc, Series C Liquidation
Value or Series D Liquidation Value, respectively, and (B) dividing the resulting product by the
Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price or Series D
Conversion Price, as applicable, then in cffect.

(b) Each conversion of Preferred Sharcs will be deemed to have been
effected as of the close of business on the date on which the stockholder delivers written notice to the
Corporation at its principal office of its desire to convert shares of Preferred Stock and surrenders the
certificate or certificates representing the Preferred Shares to be converted. At such time as such

DOCSOC/1512203v6/101992-0005
conversion has been effected, the rights of the holder of such Preferred Shares as such holder will
cease and the Person or Persons in whose name or names any certificate or certificates for shares of
Common Stock are to be issued upon such conversion will be deemed to have become the holder or
holders of record of the shares of Common Stock represented thereby. All shares of Series A
Preferred, Series B Preferred, Series C Preferred or Scries D Preferred tendered for conversion shall,
from and after the date of conversion, be deemed to have been retired and cancelled and shall not be
reissued as Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred, Series C Preferred or Series D Preferred and the
Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate action as may be necessary to reduce accordingly
the authorized number of shares of Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred, Series C Preferred or
Series D Preferred.

(c) As soon as possible after a conversion has been effected (but in any
event within five (5) business days in the case of Sections 4.1(c)(i) and 4.1(c)(iii) below), the
Corporation will deliver to the converting holder:

(i) a certificate or certificates representing the number of shares
of Common Stock issuable by reason of such conversion in such name or names and such
denomination or denominations as the converting holder has specificd;

(ii) | payment of the amount payable under Section 4.1(f) below
with respect to such conversion; and

(iii) a certificate representing any Series A Preferred Shares,
Scrics B Preferred Shares, Series C Preferred Shares or Series D Preferred Shares that were
represented by the certificate or certificates delivered to the Corporation in connection with such
conversion but which were not converted.

(d) The issuance of certificates for shares of Common Stock upon
conversion of Serics A Preferred, Series B Preferred, Series C Preferred or Scrics D Preferred will be
made without charge to the holders of such Series A Preferred, Serics B Preferred, Series C Preferred
or Series D Preferred for any issuance tax in respect thercof or other cost incurred by the Corporation
in connection with such conversion and the related issuance of sharcs of Common Stock. Upon
conversion of each Series A Preferred Share, Series B Preferred Share, Series C Preferred Share or
Series D Preferred Share, the Corporation will take all such actions as are nccessary in order to insure
that the Common Stock issuable with respect to such conversion will be validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable.

(e} The Corporation will not close its books against the transfer of shares
of Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred, Series C Preferred or Scries D Preferred or Common Stock
issued or issuable upon conversion of shares of Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred, Series C
Preferred or Series D Preferred in any manner that interferes with the timely conversion of Series A
Preferred, Scries B Preferred, Series C Preferred or Series D Preferred.

(f) If any fractional intcrest in a share of Common Stock would, except
for the provisions of this Scction 4.1(f), be deliverable upon any conversion of the Senes A
Preferred, Series B Preferred, Series C Preferred or Series D Preferred, the Corporation, in lieu of
delivering the fractional share therefor, may pay an amount to the holder thercof equal to the fair
market value (as reasonably determined in good faith by the Board) of such fractional interest as of
the date of conversion.

DOCSOC/1512203v6/101992-0005
(g) The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available, out of
its authorized but unissued Common Stock, such number of Common Shares as would be issuable
upon the conversion of all Scrics A Preferred Shares, Series B Preferred Shares, Scries C Preferred
Shares and Series D Preferred Shares then outstanding.

4.2 Conversion Prices.

(a) Initial Conversion Price. The initial “Series A Conversion Price” will
be $0.6925, the initial “Series B Conversion Price” will be $0.8905, the initial “Series C Conversion
Price” will be $0.99 and the initial “Series D Conversion Price” will be $1.2914. In order to prevent
dilution of the conversion rights granted to holders of Series A Preferred Shares, Serics B Preferred
Shares, Series C Preferred Shares and Series D Preferred Shares hereunder, the Series A Conversion
Price, Series B Conversion Price, Scrics C Conversion Price and Series D Conversion Price will be
subject to adjustment from time to time pursuant to this Section 4.2 and Sections 4.4 and 4.5 of this
PART A. For purposes of this Section 4.2, the Corporation shall be deemed to have issued or sold

(b) Adjustment for Dilutive Events. If and whenever on or after the

Options or Convertible Securities, in each case, as defined below) for consideration per share less
than the applicable Series A Conversion Pricc, Scrics B Conversion Price, Serics C Conversion Price
or Series D Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the time of such issuc or sale (a “Dilutive
Event”), then forthwith upon the occurrence of any such Dilutive Event, the Scries A Conversion
Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price and Series D Conversion Price, as
applicable, will be reduced (in order to increase the number of shares of Common Stock into which
such Series A Preferred Shares, Series B Preferred Shares, Scries C Preferred Shares and Series D
Preferred Shares are convertible) to that price per share determined by dividing (i) the sum of (x) the
product derived by multiplying the Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series C
Conversion Price or Series D Conversion Price, as applicable, in cffect immediately prior to such
Dilutive Event, times the number of shares of Common Stock Deemed Outstanding immediately
prior to the Dilutive Event plus (y) the aggregate consideration (if any) received by the Corporation
for the total number of such shares of Common Stock so issued or sold, or deemed issued or sold, in
such Dilutive Event by (ii)the number of shares of Common Stock Deemed Outstanding
immediately after such Dilutive Event. Additional shares of Common Stock issucd or sold (or
deemed issued or sold) without consideration shall be deemed to have been sold for $0.01 per share.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the issuance by the Corporation of (i) options or
other rights to acquire up to an aggregate of 3,019,938 shares of Common Stock reserved for
issuance as of the date hercof (as adjusted for stock dividends, splits, combinations and the like with

issued pursuant to stock option plans, stock option grants or other similar arrangements to officers,
directors, employees and consultants approved by the Board; (ii) shares of Common Stock issued
pursuant to a transaction for which an appropriate Conversion Price adjustment is made pursuant to

(viii) securities issued pursuant to financing leases or similar arrangements approved by holders of
not less than a majority of the then outstanding Series A Preferred Shares, Scries B Preferred Shares

outstanding Series A Preferred Shares, Series B Preferred Shares, Series C Preferred Shares and
Series D Preferred Shares, voting together as a single class on an as-converted to Common Stock
basis, as securities excluded from the Serics A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series C
Conversion Price and Series D Conversion Price adjustment provisions provided for herein, shall not
constitute a Dilutive Event.

4.3 Common Stock Deemed Outstanding. For Purposes of determining an
adjusted Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price or
Series D Conversion Price, as the casc may be, pursuant to Section 4.2(b) above, the issuances
described in Sections 4.3(b) and (c) shall each be deemed to be an issuance and sale of Common
Stock by the Corporation and the “Common Stock Deemed Outstanding” shall be the number of

but not limited to, the Common Stock that would be issuable upon Conversion of the outstanding
Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred, Series C Preferred and Series D Preferred; and (ii) the number
of shares of Common Stock deemed issued or sold Pursuant to Scctions 4.3(a) and 4.3(b) below
regardless of whether such Options or Convertible Securities arc actually exercisable at such time
(without duplication for any options, warrants, purchase rights, and convertible securities included
under clause (i) immediately preceding).

(a) Issuance of Rights or Options. If (i) the Corporation in any manner

grants any nghts, warrants or options to subscribe for or to purchase shares of Common Stock or
Convertible Securities (as defined below) (such rights or options referred to herein as “Options” ,

7

DOCSOC/1512203v6/101992-0005

Per Share” will be determined by dividing (i) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the
Corporation as consideration for the grant or sale of such Options, plus the minimum agerepate
amount of additional consideration payable to the Corporation upon exercise of all such Options, plus
in the case of such Options which relate to Convertible Sccurities, the minimum aggregate amount of
additional consideration, if any, payable to the Corporation upon the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities, by (ii) the total maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
the exercise of such Options or upon the conversion or exchange of all such Convertible Securitics
issuable upon the exercise of such Options. No further adjustment of the Series A Conversion Price,
Series B Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price or Series D Conversion Price will be made
when Convertible Securities arc actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or when Common

Convertible Securities; provided, that, if such Options expire or lapse without being exercised and/or
converted into Common Stock, then the Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price,
Series C Conversion Price or Scrics D Conversion Price, as the case may be, will be readjusted to the
Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price or Series D
Conversion Price which would have been in effect had such expired or lapsed Options not been
issued.

(b) Issuance of Convertible Securities. If (i) the Corporation in any
manner issues or sells any sccuritics convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock
(“Convertible Securities”), whether or not the right to convert or exchange any such Convertible
Securities are immediately exercisable, and (ii) the Price Per Share of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion or exchange is less than the Series A Conversion Price, Series B
Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price or Series D Conversion Price, as applicable, in effect
immediately prior to the time of such issuc or sale, then (x) the maximum number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities will be deemed
to be Common Stock issued and sold by the Corporation, (y) the consideration received pursuant to
the Dilutive Event will be deemed to cqual the Price Per Share times the number of shares of
Common Stock so deemed issued and sold by the Corporation and (z) the number of shares of
Common Stock so deemed issued and sold by the Corporation shall be included in the Common
Stock Deemed Outstanding immediately after such Dilutive Event. For the purposes of this
Section 4.3(b), the “Price Per Share” wil] be determined by dividing (i) the total amount received or

.

receivable by the Corporation as consideration for the issue or sale of such Convertible Securities,
plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to the Corporation
upon the conversion or exchange thereof (including for the avoidance of doubt, any amounts required
by Section 4.3(e) below), by (ii) the total maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable
upon the conversion or exchange of all such Convertible Securities. No further adjustment of the
Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price or Series D
Conversion Price will be made when Common Stock is actually issued upon the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, and if any such issue or sale of such Convertible Securities

Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price or Series D Conversion Price, as the case may be, will
be readjusted to the Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price

DOCSOC/1512203v6/101992-0005

or Series D Conversion Price which would have been in effect had such expired or lapsed
Convertible Securitics not been issued.

(d) Calculation of Consideration Received. If any shares of Common
Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are issucd or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold for

reccived, respectively, by the Corporation will be the Market Price thercof as of the date of receipt.
If any shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Sccuritics are issued in connection with any

{e) Integrated Transactions. In case any Option is issued in connection

with the issuance or sale of other Securitics of the Corporation, together comprising one integrated
transaction in which no specific consideration is allocated to such Option by the parties thereto, the
Option will be deemed to have been issued for a consideration of $0.01. In addition, for purposes of
determining the adjustment pursuant to Section 4.2(b), the agercgatc consideration received or
receivable by the Corporation shall include both the purchase price paid or to be paid for such other
security plus the consideration allocated to the Option pursuant to this Section 4.3{c), and such
Option shall not be treated as a scparate issuance.

DOCSOC/1512203v6/101992-0005

(f) Treasury Shares. The number of shares of Common Stock Deemed
Outstanding at any given time shall not include sharcs owned or held by or for the account of the
Corporation, and the disposition of any shares so owned or held shall be considered an issuance or
sale of Common Stock by the Corporation.

(g) Record Date. If the Corporation takes a record of the holders of
Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them (i) to receive a dividend or other distribution
payable in shares of Common Stock, Options or in Convertible Securities or (ii) to subscribe for or
purchase shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities, then such record date will be
deemed to be the date of the issuance or sale of the shares of Common Stock deemed to have been
issued or sold upon the declaration of such dividend or upon the making of such other distribution or
the date of the granting of such right of subscription or purchase, as the case may be.

4.4 Subdivision or Combination of Common Stock. If the Corporation at any
time subdivides (by any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or otherwise) its outstanding
shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, the Series A Conversion Price, Series B
Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price and Serics D Conversion Price in effect immediately
prior to such subdivision will be proportionately reduced so that the number of shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of cach share of Series A Preferred, Scries B Preferred, Series C
Preferred and Series D Preferred shall be increased in proportion to such increase of the aggregate
number of shares of outstanding Common Stock. If the Corporation at any time combines (by
reverse stock split or otherwise) its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of
shares, the Series A Conversion Pricc, Scries B Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price and
Series D Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such combination will be proportionately
increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of each share of
Series A Preferred, Scrics B Preferred, Series C Preferred and Series D Preferred shall be decreased
in proportion to such decrease of the aggregate number of sharcs of outstanding Common Stock.

4.5 Organic Change. Upon the consummation of an Organic Change, the terms
of the Preferred Stock shall be deemed modified, without payment of any additional consideration
therefor, so as to provide that upon the conversion of the Preferred Shares following the
consummation of such Organic Change, the holder of such Preferred Shares shall have the right to
acquire and receive (in lieu of or in addition to the shares of Common Stock acquirable and
receivable prior to the Organic Change) such shares of stock, securities or asscts as such holder
would have received if such holder had converted its Preferred Shares into Common Stock
immediately prior to such Organic Change, in each case giving effect to any adjustment of the
Senes A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price or Scries D
Conversion Price, as the case may be, made after the date of consummation of the Organic Change.
All other terms of the Preferred Stock shall remain in full force and effect following such an Organic
Change. The provisions of this Section 4.5 shall similarly apply to successive Organic Changes.

4.6 Notices.

(a) Immediatcly upon any adjustment of the Scrics A Conversion Price,
Series B Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price or Series D Conversion Price, as the case may
be, the Corporation shall give written notice thereof to all holders of Series A Preferred, Series B

(b) The Corporation shall give written notice to all holders of Preferred
Stock at least twenty (20) days prior to the date on which the Corporation closes its books or takes a

outstanding Series D Preferred Shares and (ii) the holders of a majority of the then outstanding
Series A Preferred Shares, Series B Preferred Shares and Series C Preferred Shares, voting together
as a single class on an as-converted to Common Stock basis, shall so elect, by vote or written
consent, all of the outstanding Series A Preferred Shares, Series B Preferred Shares, Senes C
Preferred Shares and Series D Preferred Shares shall automatically convert into shares of Common
Stock upon such election, vote or consent and without any further action by the holders of such
Series A Preferred Shares, Series B Preferred Shares, Series C Preferred Shares and Series D
Preferred Shares and whether or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the
Corporation or its transfer agent.

4.8 Mandatory Conversion Upon Qualified Public Offering. If a firm
commitment underwritten Public Offering of shares of Common Stock (a “Qualified Public
Offering”) is effected in which the aggregate net proceeds to the Corporation are at least $50,000,000
(after underwriting discounts, commissions and fees), then all of the outstanding shares of Preferred
Stock shall be automatically converted into shares of Common Stock immediately prior to and
