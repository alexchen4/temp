. Company are other than cash, then the value of such assets shall be their fair market value as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, except that any publicly-traded securities to be
distributed to shareholders in a liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company shall be
valued as follows:

(i) Ifthe securities are then traded on a national securities exchange or the

Distribution date shall be deemed to be the date such transaction closes.

3.4 Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion ‘rights as

Company or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, into that number of fully-paid, nonassessable
shares of Common Stock determined by dividing the Original Issue Price for the relevant series by
the Conversion Price for such series. (The number of shares of Common Stock into which each

share of Preferred Stock of a series may be converted is hereinafter referred to as the “Conversion:

. Rate” for each such series.) Upon any decrease or increase in the Conversion Price for any series of
Preferred Stock, as described in this Section 3.4, the Conversion Rate for such series shall be
appropriately increased or decreased.

(b) | Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be

converted into fully-paid, nonassessable shares of Common Stock at the then effective Conversion

Rate for such share (i) immediately prior to the closing of Qualified Public Offering, or r (ii) upon the

receipt by the Company of a written request for such conversion from the holders of a majority of the

Preferred Stock then outstanding, or, if later, the effective date for conversion specified in such

requests {each of the events referred to in (i) and (ii) are referred to herein as an “Automatic
Conversion Event’).

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be .

issued upon conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder
would otherwise be entitled, the Company shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the
then fair market value of a share of Common Stock as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors. For such purpose, all shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder of Preferred Stock
Shall be aggregated, and any resulting fractional share of Common Stock shall be paid in cash.
Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into full shares of
Common Stock, and to receive certificates therefor, such holder shall surrender the certificate or
certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Company or of any transfer agent for the
Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the Company at such office that such holder elects to
convert the same; provided, however, that on the date of an Automatic Conversion Event, the
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically, without any further action by
the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates representing such shares are
surrendered to the Company or its transfer agent; provided further, however, that the Company shall
not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such
Automatic Conversion Event unless either the certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock
are delivered to the Company or its transfer agent as provided above, or the holder notifies the
Company or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes
an agreement satisfactory to the Company to indemnify the Company from any loss incurred by it in
connection with such certificates. On the date of the occurrence of an Automatic Conversion Event,
each holder of record of shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, notwithstanding that the certificates representing

WSGR:2279070_1.doc -5-

such shares of Preferred Stock shall not have been surrendered at the office of the Company, that
notice from the Company shall not have been received by any holder of record of shares of Preferred

Stock, or that the certificates evidencing such shares of Common Stock shall not then be actually
delivered to such holder.

(i) Special Definition. For purposes of this Section 3.4(d), “Additional

WSGR:2279070_1.doc -6-
provided, however, that the shares of Common Stock excluded from the definition of Additional
Shares of Common pursuant to subsections (2) or (6) through (9) above shall not be excluded from
such definition to the extent that the aggregate number of such shares issued exceeds twenty-five
percent (25%) of the total number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding (determined on a
fully-diluted basis, as adjusted for Recapitalizations).

(ii) | No Adjustment of Conversion Price. No adjustment in the Conversion
Price of a particular series of Preferred Stock shall be made in respect of the issuance of Additional
Shares of Common unless the consideration per share (as determined pursuant to Section 3.4(d)(v))

Conversion Price in effect on the date of, and immediately prior to such issue, for such series of
Preferred Stock. "

(iii) | Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common. In the event the
Company at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall issue any Options or
Convertible Securities or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class. of
securities entitled to receive any such Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum number
of shares (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto without regard to any provisions contained
therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of
such Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities, the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities or, in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such
Options and the conversion or exchange of the underlying securities, shall be deemed to have been
issued as of the time of such issue or, in case such.a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close
of business on such record date, provided that in any such case in which shares are deemed to be
issued:

(1) __ no further adjustment in the Conversion Price of the Preferred
Stock shall be made upon the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities or shares of Common Stock
in connection with the exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities;

(2) if such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms
provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any increase in the consideration payable to the
Company, or decrease in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable, upon the exercise,
conversion or exchange thereof, the Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock computed upon the
original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and any
subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon any such increase or decrease becoming effective,
be recomputed to reflect such increase or decrease insofar as it affects such Options or the rights of
conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities;

(3) no readjustment pursuant to clause (2) above shall have the
effect of increasing the Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock to an amount which exceeds the
-lower of (i) the Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock on the original adjustment date, or (ii) the
Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock that would have resulted from any issuance of Additional
Shares of Common between the original adjustment date and such readjustment date;

WSGR:2279070_1.doc -7-

(4) upon the expiration of any such Options or any rights of
conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have been exercised, the
Conversion Price computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date
with respect thereto) and any subsequent adjustments based thereon shall, upon such expiration, be
recomputed as if:

a) in the case of Convertible Securities or Options for
Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common issued were the shares of Common Stock, if
any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities and the consideration received therefor was the consideration actually
received by the Company for the issue of such exercised Options plus the consideration actually
received by the Company upon such exercise or for the issue of all such Convertible Securities which
were actually converted or exchanged, plus the additional consideration, if any, actually received by
the Company upon such conversion or exchange, and _

b) in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, only
the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were issued at the time of
issue of such Options, and the consideration received by the Company for the Additional Shares of
Common deemed to have been then issued was the consideration actually received by the Company
for the issue of such exercised Options, plus the consideration deemed to have been received by the
Company (determined pursuant to Section 3.4(d)(v)) upon the issue of the Convertible Securities
with respect to which such Options were actually exercised; and

(5) if such record date shall have been fixed and such Options or
Convertible Securities are not issued on the date fixed therefor, the adjustment previously made in
the Conversion Price which became effective on such record date shall be canceled as of the close of
business on such record date, and thereafter the Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this
Section 3.4(d)iii) as of the actual date of their issuance.

(iv) Adjustment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional Shares -
of Common. In the event this Company shall issue Additional Shares of Common (including
Additional Shares of Common deemed to be issued pursuant to Section 3.4(d\iii)) without
consideration or for a consideration per share less than the applicable Conversion Price of a series of
Preferred Stock in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such issue, then, the Conversion
Price of the affected series of Preferred Stock shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a
price (calculated to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction,
the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to such issue plus the number of shares which the aggregate consideration received by the
Company for the total number of Additional Shares of Common so issued would purchase at such
Conversion Price, and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of such Additional Shares of Common
so issued. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Conversion Price shall not be reduced at such time if
the amount of such reduction would be less than $0.01, but any such amount shall be carried
forward, and a reduction will be made with respect to such amount at the time of, and together with,
any subsequent reduction which, together with such amount and any other amounts so carried
forward, equal $0.01 or more in the aggregate. For the purposes of this Section 3.4(d)(iv), all shares

WSGR:2279070_1.doc -8-
of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding Options or the conversion of outstanding
Convertible Securities and shares of Preferred Stock, and all Additional Shares of Common deemed
issued pursuant to Section 3.4(d)(iii) hereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this Section 3.4(d),
the consideration received by the Company for the issue (or deemed issue) of any Additional Shares
of Common shall be computed as follows:

(1) Cash and Property. Such consideration shall:

a) _—s insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the

- aggregate amount ‘of cash received by the Company excluding amounts paid or payable for accrued
interest or dividends;

b) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair market value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors; and

-¢) in the event Additional Shares of Common are issued
together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Company for consideration which
covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in clauses
(a) and (b) above, as reasonably determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(2) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per
share received by the Company for Additional Shares of Common deemed to have been issued
pursuant to Section 3.4(d){iii) shall be determined by dividing

a) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the
Company as consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the minimum
aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without
regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration) payable
to the Company upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such
Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities by

b) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as
set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a
subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion
or exchange of such Convertible Securities.

(e) Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of Common Stock. In the event
the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided (by stock split, by payment of a stock
dividend or otherwise), into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price of
each series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall, concurrently
with the effectiveness of such subdivision, be proportionately decreased. In the event the
outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined (by reclassification or otherwise) into a
lesser number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Prices in effect immediately prior to such

WSGR:2279070_1.doc -9-
_combination shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination, be proportionately
increased.

(f) Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of Preferred Stock. in the
event the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock or a series of Preferred Stock shall be subdivided (by
stock split, by payment of a stock dividend or otherwise), into a greater number of shares of
Preferred Stock, the Dividend Rate, Original Issue Price and Liquidation Preference of the affected
' series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall, concurrently with the
effectiveness of such subdivision, be proportionately decreased. In the event the outstanding shares

of Preferred Stock or a series of Preferred Stock shall be combined (by reclassification or otherwise) |

- into a lesser number-of shares of Preferred Stock, the Dividend Rate, Original Issue Price and

. Liquidation Preference of:the affected series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such’

combination shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination, be proportionately
increased.

(g) Adjustments for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. Subject to
Section 3.3 above (the “Liquidation Rights”), if the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the
Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of any other class or
classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a
subdivision or combination of shares provided for above), then, in any such event, in lieu of the
number of shares of Common Stock which the holders would otherwise have been entitled to
receive, each holder of such Preferred Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such shares of
Preferred Stock into a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock which a holder of the
number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of such series of Preferred Stock
immediately before that change would have been entitled to receive in such reorganization or
reclassification, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein with respect to such other shares.

(h) NoImpairment. The Company will not through any reorganization, transfer of
assets, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to
avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by
the Company but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this
Section 3.4 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect
the Conversion Rights of the holders of Preferred Stock against impairment. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Section 3.4(h) shall prohibit the Company from amending its Articles of
Incorporation with the requisite consent of its shareholders and the board of directors.

(i) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 3.4, the Company at its expense shall
promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish
to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and
showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Company
shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be
furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and readjustments, (ii) the
Conversion Price at the time in effect and (iii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the
amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon the conversion of
-Preferred Stock.

WSGR:2279070_I.doc -10-

(j) Waiver of Adjustment of Conversion Price. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, any downward adjustment of the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock
may be waived, either prospectively or retroactively and either generally or in a particular instance,
by the consent or vote of the holders of the majority of the outstanding shares of such series. Any
such waiver shall bind all future holders of shares of such series of Preferred Stock.

(k) = Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Company shall at all
times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock solely
for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock, such number of its
shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then

- outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued
shares of Common. Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding
shares of the Preferred Stock, the Company will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of
its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such
number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.

Preferred Stock shall be entitled to vote on all matters on which the Common Stock shall be entitled
