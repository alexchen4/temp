multiplied by the fair market value of a share of Common Stock as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors of the Corporation. Whethcr or not fractional shares would be issuable
upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Preferred
Stock the holder is at the time converting into Common Stock and the aggregate number of
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion.

(1) In order for a holder of Series A Preferred Stock to voluntarily
convert shares of Semes A Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall
surrender the certificate or certificates for such shares of Series A Preferred Stock (or, if such
registered holder alleges that such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate
affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation
against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss. theft
or destruction of such certificate), at the office of the transfer agent for the Scries A Preferred
Stock (or at the principal office of the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer
agent), together with written notice that such holder elects to convert all or any number of the
shares of the Series A Preferred Stock represented by such certificate or certificates and, if
applicable, any event on which such conversion is contingent. Such notice shall state such
holder's name or the names of the nominees in which such holder wishes the certificate or
certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued. If required by the Corporation, certificates
surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or
instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered
holder or his, her or its attorney duly authorized in writing. The close of business on the date of
receipt by the transfer agent of such certificates (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement) and
notice (or by the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent) shall be the time
of conversion (the “Series A Conversion Time’), and the shares of Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of the shares represented by such certificate shall be deemed to be outstanding
of record as of such date. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after the Series A
Conversion Time, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Series A Preferred Stock, or
to his, her or its nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock
to which such holder shal] be entitled, together with cash in lieu of any fraction of a share.

(ii) | The Corporation shall at all times when the Series A Preferred
Stock shall be outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued stock,
for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, such number of its
duly authorized shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding Series A Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all then outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall take such
corporate action as may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common
Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including, without
limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary
amendment to this Certificate of Incorporation. Before taking any action which would cause an
adjustment reducing the Series A Conversion Price below the then par value of the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Corporation will
take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary 1n order that the

the Corporation (without the need for stockholder action) may from time to time take such
appropriate action as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Series A
Preferred Stock accordingly.

Conversion Price shall be made for any declared but unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred
Stock surrendered for conversion or on the Common Stock delivered upon conversion.

that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon

involved in the issuance and dejivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in
which the shares of Series A Preferred Stock so converted were registered, and no such issuance
or delivery shall be made unless and until the person or entity requesting such issuance has paid

satisfaction of any conditions to exercisability, convertibility ot exchangeability but without
regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable
upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities and Options therefor,

contained therein or as a result of an amendment to such terms) to provide for either (1) any
increase or decrease in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise,
conversion or exchange of any such Option or Convertible Security or (2) any increase or
decrease in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion or

upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto) shall be readjusted to such Series A
Conversion Price as would have obtained had such revised terms been in effect upon the original
date of issuance of such Option or Convertible Security. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
adjustment pursuant to this clause (B) shall have the effect of increasing the Series A Conversion
Price to an amount which exceeds the lower of (i) the Series A Conversion Price on the original

A Original Issue Date), are revised after the Series A Original Issue Date (either automatically
pursuant to the provisions contained therein or as a result of an amendment to such terms) to
provide for either (1) any increase or decrease in the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any such Option or Convertible Security
or (2) any increase or decrease in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon such

distribution, then and in each such event the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall reccive,
simultaneously with the distribution to the holders of such capital stock, a dividend or other
distribution of such securities or other property in an amount equal to the amount of such
securities or other property as they would have received if all outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event.

(h) Adjustment for Merger or Reorganization, etc. Subject to the provisions
of Subsection 2(c), if there shall occur any reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
consolidation or merger involving the Corporation in which the Common Stock (but not the
Senes A Preferred Stock) is converted into or exchanged for securities, cash or other property
