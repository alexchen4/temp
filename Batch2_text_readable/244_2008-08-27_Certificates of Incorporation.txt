whether in cash or property, shall be paid or declared, nor shall any other distribution be made, with
respect to any Junior Stock, nor shall any shares of any Junior Stock of the Company be purchased,
redeemed, or otherwise acquired for value by the Company (except for acquisitions of Common Stock by
the Company pursuant to agreements which permit the Company to repurchase such shares upon
termination of services to the Company or in exercise of the Company's right of first refusal upon a
proposed transfer) until all dividends (set forth in Section D.2(a) above) with respect to the Preferred
Stock shall have been paid or declared and set apart. In the event dividends are paid on any share of

aside for each share of Junior Stock. The provisions of this Section D.2(b) shall not, however, apply to
the acquisition of shares of any Junior Stock in exchange for shares of any other Junior Stock (provided
such exchange constitutes an equal exchange, determined on an as converted to Common Stock basis).

consent in the same manner as the Common Stock, in either case upon the following basis: each holder of
shares of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to such number of votes as shall be equal to the number of

written consent of the holders of Preferred Stock that are entitled to such notice rights or similar notice
tights and that represent at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of such
Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class on an as-converted to Common Stock basis and not as a
separate series).

(g) The following events shall be considered a liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Company under this Section D.4:

(i) Any consolidation, exchange or merger of the Company with or
into any other corporation or other entity or person (or group of entities or persons), or any other
corporate reorganization or transfer of capital stock, in which the stockholders of the Company
immediately prior to such consolidation, exchange, merger or reorganization, own less than fifty percent
(50%) of the Company’s voting power immediately after such consolidation, exchange, merger or
reorganization, or any transaction or series of related transactions to which the Company is a party in
which in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the Company’s voting power is transferred, excluding any
consolidation or merger elected exclusively to change the domicile of the Company (an “Acquisition”); or

all of the assets of the Company in any transaction or series of related transactions (an “Asset Transfer”);

“Change in Control.”

(h) In the event of such a Change in Control, if the consideration received by
the Company or its stockholders is other than cash, the value of such non-cash consideration shall be
deemed its fair market value as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors as of the date of such
Change in Control. Any securities shall be valued as follows:

PGHUB-2321816.12-JPDENNIS &/27/08 8:47 AM
(i) Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar
restrictions on free marketability covered by Subsection D.4(h)(ii) below:

(A) If traded on a securities exchange or through the Nasdaq
National Market, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on
such quotation system over the thirty (30) day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing;

(B) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the thirty (30)
day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing; and

(C) If there is no active public market, the value shall be the
fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Board of Directors and the holders of at least
seventy percent (70%) of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (voting
together as a single class on an as-converted to Common Stock basis and not as a separate series).

(ii) The method of valuation of securities subject to investment letter
or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of a
stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount from the
market value determined as above in Subsection D.4(h)(i)(A), (B) or (C) to reflect the approximate fair
market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Board of Directors and the holders of at least seventy
percent (70%) of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of such Preferred Stock (voting together
as a single class on an as-converted to Common Stock basis and not as a separate series).

(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Section D.4 to the contrary, if upon any
liquidation event described in Section D.4(g), the holders of Preferred Stock would receive a greater
aggregate liquidation amount if such holders’ converted such holders’ shares of Preferred Stock into
Common Stock than such holders would be entitled to receive pursuant to Sections D.4(a)-(d) as holders
of Preferred Stock, then such holders shall not receive any amounts under such sections as holders of
Preferred Stock but shall be treated, for the purposes of determining such holders’ rights under such
sections only, as though such holders held, in addition to any shares of Common Stock then actually held
by such holders, such number of shares of Common Stock that such holders would hold if such holders
had then converted such holders’ shares of Preferred Stock into Common Stock, effective immediately
prior to such liquidation event, at the then applicable Conversion Rate for each series of Preferred Stock.
For the avoidance of doubt, however, in no event shall any holders of Preferred Stock be entitled to
receive under this Section D.4(i) both the liquidation preference set forth in Sections D.4(a)-(d) and any
distribution pursuant to the notional conversion described in this Section D.4(i).

6. Conversion. The holders of Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as follows
(the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Optional Conversion; Conversion Price. Each share of Preferred Stock
shall be convertible, without the payment of any additional consideration by the holder thereof and at the
option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share, at the office of the
Company or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable
shares of Common Stock as is determined in accordance with the following:

(i) In the case of the Series A Preferred Stock, by dividing the
Original Issue Price for the Series A Preferred Stock by the Series A Conversion Price (as defined below)
in effect at the time of conversion. The conversion price at which shares of Common Stock shall be
deliverable upon conversion of each share of Series A Preferred Stock without the payment of additional
consideration by the holder thereof shall initially be the Original Issue Price for such share of Series A
Preferred Stock, subject to adjustment, in order to adjust the number of shares of Common Stock into
which the Series A Preferred Stock is convertible, as hereinafter provided (the “Series A Conversion
Price”).

(ii) In the case of the Series B Preferred Stock, by dividing the
Original Issue Price for the Series B Preferred Stock by the Series B Conversion Price (as defined below)
in effect at the time of conversion. The conversion price at which shares of Common Stock shall be
deliverable upon conversion of each share of Series B Preferred Stock without the payment of additional
consideration by the holder thereof shall initially be the Original Issue Price for such share of Series B
Preferred Stock, subject to adjustment, in order to adjust the number of shares of Common Stock into
which the Series B Preferred Stock is convertible, as hereinafter provided (the “Series B Conversion
Price”).

(iii) In the case of the Series C Preferred Stock, by dividing the
Original Issue Price for the Series C Preferred Stock by the Series C Conversion Price (as defined below)
in effect at the time of conversion. The conversion price at which shares of Common Stock shall be
deliverable upon conversion of each share of Series C Preferred Stock without the payment of additional
consideration by the holder thereof shall initially be the Original Issue Price for such share of Series C
Preferred Stock, subject to adjustment, in order to adjust the number of shares of Common Stock into
which the Series C Preferred Stock is convertible, as hereinafter provided (the “Series C_ Conversion
Price”).

(iv) In the case of the Series D Preferred Stock, by dividing the
Original Issue Price for the Series D Preferred Stock by the Series D Conversion Price (as defined below)
in effect at the time of conversion. The conversion price at which shares of Common Stock shall be
deliverable upon conversion of each share of Series D Preferred Stock without the payment of additional
consideration by the holder thereof shal! initially be the Original Issue Price for such share of Series D
Preferred Stock, subject to adjustment, in order to adjust the number of shares of Common Stock into
which the Series D Preferred Stock is convertible, as hereinafter provided (the “Series D Conversion
Price”).

(v) In the case of the Series E Preferred Stock, by dividing the

Original Issue Price for the Series E Preferred Stock by the Series E Conversion Price (as defined below)

in effect at the time of conversion. The conversion price at which shares of Common Stock shall be

deliverable upon conversion of each share of Series E Preferred Stock without the payment of additional
11

PGHLIB-2321616.12-JPOENNIS 8/2718 6.47 AM
consideration by the holder thereof shall initially be the Original Issue Price for such share of Series E
Preferred Stock, subject to adjustment, in order to adjust the number of shares of Common Stock into

which the Series E Preferred Stock is convertible, as hereinafter provided (the “Series E Conversion
Price’’).

(vi) | The Series A Conversion Price, the Series B Conversion Price,
the Series C Conversion Price, the Series D Conversion Price and the Series E Conversion Price, as such
Conversion Price applies to each series, shall sometimes be referred to herein as the “Applicable

Conversion Price”.

The right of conversion with respect to any shares of Preferred Stock which shall have
been called for redemption under Section D.8 hereof shall terminate at the close of business on the day
fixed for redemption unless the Company shall default in the payment of the redemption price, in which
case the right of conversion with respect to such shares shall continue unless and until such redemption
price is paid in full.

(b) Mechanics of Optional Conversions. Before any holder of Preferred

Stock shall be entitled to convert shares of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, the holder shall
surrender the certificate or certificates therefor at the office of the Company or of any transfer agent for
the Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the Company at such office that the holder elects to
convert the same. Such notice shall state the number of shares of Preferred Stock being converted and
shall state therein the holder’s name or the name or names of the holder’s nominees in which the holder
wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued. On the date of conversion,
all rights with respect to the Preferred Stock so converted shall terminate, except any of the rights of the
holder thereof, upon surrender of the holder’s certificate or certificates therefor, to receive certificates for
the number of shares of Common Stock into which such Preferred Stock has been converted and cash in
an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends on, and any and all other amounts owing with
respect to, the shares of Preferred Stock being converted to and including the time of conversion. If so
required by the Company, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by
written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Company, duly executed by the
registered holder or by the holder’s attorney duly authorized in writing. Upon the optional conversion of
the Preferred Stock, all shares of Preferred Stock being converted by any holder thereof shall be
aggregated for the purpose of determining the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder
shall be entitled, and no fractional share of Common Stock shall be issued. In lieu of any fractional share
to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the Company shall pay cash equal to such fraction
multiplied by the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of conversion, as reasonably
determined by the Board of Directors in good faith. The Company shall, promptly after surrender of the
certificate or certificates for conversion, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock,
or to the holder's nominee or nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common
Stock to which the holder shall be entitled as aforesaid, together with cash in lieu of any fraction of a
share and cash in an amount equal to all dividends declared but unpaid thereon and any and all other
amounts owing with respect thereto at such time. Unless otherwise specified by the holder in the written
notice of conversion, such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close
of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person
or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion shall be treated for
all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date.

(c) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall
automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the Applicable Conversion Price then in
effect, as the case may be, upon the occurrence of either of the following:

12

PGHLIB-2321616.12-JPDENNIS 8/2708 8:47 AM
(i) at any time upon the affirmative election of the holders of at least
seventy-five percent (75%) of the outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred
Stock and Series B and C Stock (voting together as if a single class on an as-converted to Common Stock
basis and not as separate series), or

(ii) immediately upon the closing of the Company’s first firm
commitment public offering underwritten by an investment banking firm of national reputation pursuant
to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, covering the offer and
sale of Common Stock for the account of the Company at a price equal to or greater than three times (3x)
the Original Issue Price for the Series E Preferred Stock (as adjusted as provided herein) with aggregate
gross proceeds to the Company of at least $40 million before expenses (“Qualified Public Offering”).

(d) Mechanics of Automatic Conversions. Upon the occurrence of an event
specified in Section 6(c), the shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically without any
further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates representing such shares
are surrendered to the Company or its transfer agent; provided, however, that all holders of shares of
Preferred Stock being converted shall be given written notice of the occurrence of the event specified in
Section 6(c) triggering such conversion, including the date such event occurred (the “Mandatory
Conversion Date”), and the Company shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion unless certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred
Stock being converted are either delivered to the Company or its transfer agent, or the holder notifies the
Company or any transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen, or destroyed and executes an
agreement satisfactory to the Company to indemnify the Company from any loss incurred by it in
connection therewith. On the Mandatory Conversion Date, all rights with respect to the shares of
Preferred Stock so converted shall terminate, except any of the rights of the holder thereof, upon
surrender of the holder’s certificate or certificates therefor, to receive certificates for the number of shares
of Common Stock into which such Preferred Stock has been converted, together with cash in an amount
equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends on, and any and all other amounts owing with respect to, the
shares of Preferred Stock converted to and including the time of conversion. Upon the automatic
conversion of the shares of Preferred Stock, the holders of such shares shall surrender the certificates
representing such shares at the office of the Company or of its transfer agent. If so required by the
Company, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by written instrument
or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Company, duly executed by the registered holder or
by the holder’s attorney duly authorized in writing. Upon surrender of such certificates there shall be
issued and delivered to such holder, or to such holder’s nominee or nominees promptly at such office, a
certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Preferred
Stock surrendered were convertible on the date on which such automatic conversion occurred, together
with cash in an amount equal to all dividends declared but unpaid on, and any and all other amounts
owing with respect to, the shares of Preferred Stock converted to and including the time of conversion.
Upon the automatic conversion of the Preferred Stock, all shares of Preferred Stock being converted by
any holder thereof shall be aggregated for the purpose of determining the number of shares of Common
Stock to which such holder shall be entitled, and no fractional share of Common Stock shall be issued. In
lieu of any fractional share to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the Company shall pay cash
equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair market value of the Common Stock on the Mandatory
Conversion Date, as reasonably determined by the Board of Directors in good faith.

Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of shares (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto ~
without regard to any provisions contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) of
Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities and
Options therefor, the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to be
Additional Shares of Common Stock issued as of the time of such issue or, in case such a record date
shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, and the applicable Conversion Price
of such series of Preferred Stock shall be adjusted accordingly, provided that in any such case in which
Additional Shares of Common Stock are deemed to be issued:

() no further adjustment in the Applicable
Conversion Price of any such series of Preferred Stock shall be made upon the exercise of such Options or
conversion or exchange of the Convertible Securities;

(ID if such Options or Convertible Securities by
their terms provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any increase in the consideration payable to

conversion or exchange thereof, the Applicable Conversion Price of any such series of Preferred Stock
computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto),
and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon any such increase or decrease becoming
effective, be recomputed to reflect such increase or decrease insofar as it affects such Options or the rights
of conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities;

15

PGHLIB-232 1616. 12-JPOENNIS 8/27/08 8:47 AM
(IJ) upon the expiration of any such Options or any
rights of conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have been exercised,
the Applicable Conversion Price of any such series of Preferred Stock computed upon the original issue
thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments
based thereon, shall, upon such expiration, be recomputed as if:

(1) In the case of Convertible Securities or
Options for Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common Stock issued were the shares of
Common Stock, if any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange
of such Convertible Securities and the consideration received therefor was the consideration actually
received by the Company for the issue of all such Options, whether or not exercised, plus the
consideration actually received by the Company upon such exercise, or for the issue of all such
Convertible Securities which were actually converted or exchanged, plus the additional consideration, if
any, actually received by the Company upon such conversion or exchange; and

(2) in the case of Options for Convertible
Securities only the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were issued at
the time of issue of such Options, and the consideration received by the Company for the Additional
Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been then issued was the consideration actually received by the
Company for the issue of all such Options, whether or not exercised, plus the consideration deemed to
have been received by the Company (determined pursuant to Subsection 6(e)v)) upon the issue of the
Convertible Securities with respect to which such Options were actually exercised;

(IV) no readjustment pursuant to clause (1) or (2)
immediately above shall have the effect of increasing the Applicable Conversion Price of any such series

such series of Preferred Stock on the original adjustment date, or (ii) the Applicable Conversion Price of
any such series of Preferred Stock that would have resulted from any issuance of Additional Shares of
Common Stock between the original adjustment date and such readjustment date; and

(V) if such record date shall have been fixed and
such Options or Convertible Securities are not issued on the date fixed therefor, the adjustment previously
made in the Applicable Conversion Price of any such series of Preferred Stock which became effective on
such record date shall be canceled as of the close of business on such record date, and thereafter the
Applicable Conversion Price of any such series of Preferred Stock shall be adjusted pursuant to this
Subsection 6(e)(iii) as of the actual date of their issuance.

(iv) j nt_of Conversion Pri n_I fe) itio
Shares of Common Stock. If and whenever the Company shall issue or sell, or is, in accordance with

Conversion Price, (B) in the case of the Series D Preferred Stock, the Series D Conversion Price and (C)
in the case of the Series C Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series A Preferred Stock, the
Series C Conversion Price, in effect immediately prior to the time of such issue or sale, then, forthwith
upon such issue or sale, the Applicable Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock shall be reduced
concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest hundredth of a cent) determined by
multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of shares which the

16

PGHLIB-2321816.12-JPDENNIS 8/2748 8:47 AM
aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of
Common so issued would purchase at such Conversion Price, and the denominator of which shall be the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of such
Additional Shares of Common so issued. For the purposes of this Subsection D.6(e)(iv), all shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock and the exercise

and/or conversion of any other outstanding Convertible Securities and all outstanding Options shall be
deemed to be outstanding.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any adjustment in Applicable Conversion
Prices hereunder, in the event that the percentage decrease in the Series A Conversion Price or Series B
Conversion Price is greater than the percentage decrease in the Series C Conversion Price, then the Series
A Conversion Price or the Series B Conversion Price, as applicable, shall instead be adjusted by an
amount equal to the percentage decrease in the Series C Conversion Price.

(v) Deternination of Consideration. For purposes of this Subsection
D.6(e), the consideration received by the Company for the issue (or deemed issue) of any Additional
Shares of Common Stock shall be computed as follows:

(A) Cash and Property: Such consideration shall:

() insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
aggregate amounts of cash received by the Company before deducting any reasonable discounts,
commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the Company for any underwriting, or
amounts paid or payable for accrued interest or accrued dividends, or otherwise, in connection with such
issuance;

(ID insofar as it consists of property other than cash,
be computed at the fair value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors; and

(Ill) in the event Additional Shares of Common
Stock are issued together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Company for consideration
which covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in clauses
(IT) and (II) above, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(B) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration
per share received by the Company for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued

pursuant to Subsection 6(e)(iii)(A), relating to Options and Convertible Securities, shall be determined by
dividing (x) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Company as consideration for the issue
of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional
consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained
therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration) payable to the Company upon the exercise of
such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for
Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, by (y) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set
forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a
subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities.

decreased.

(B) Combinations or Consolidations. In the event that, at
any time on or after the Filing Date, the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined or
consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, the

combination or consolidation shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination or
consolidation, be proportionately increased.

(fp) Adjustm for Certain Dividends and Distributions. In the event that,
at any time on or after the Filing Date, the Company shall make or issue, or fix a record date for the

upon conversion thereof in addition to the number of shares of Common Stock receivable thereupon, the
amount of securities of the Company that they would have received had their Preferred Stock been
converted into Common Stock immediately prior to such event and had they thereafter, during the period
from the date of such event to and including the conversion date, retained such securities receivable by
them as aforesaid during such period, giving application during such period to all adjustments called for
herein.

(g) Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange, or Substitution. In the event

that at any time or from time to time on or after the Filing Date, the Common Stock issuable upon the
conversion of such series of Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or a different number of
shares of any class or series of stock or other securities or property, whether by capital reorganization,
reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise (other than in a transaction covered by paragraph (e) (vi) or
(f) above, then and in each such event the holder of any shares of such series of Preferred Stock shall have
the right thereafter to convert such shares into the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities
and property receivable upon such reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization or other change by the
holder of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Common Stock into
which such shares of such series of Preferred Stock might have been converted immediately prior to such
reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization or change, all subject to further adjustment as provided
herein.

(h) Adjustment for Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets. In the event
that at any time after the Filing Date, the Company shall merge or consolidate with or into another entity
or sell all or substantially all of its assets, and such consolidation, merger or sale is not treated as a
liquidation, each share of such series of Preferred Stock shall thereafter be convertible into the kind and
amount of shares of stock or other securities or property to which a holder of the number of shares of
Common Stock of the Company deliverable upon conversion of such series of Preferred Stock would
have been entitled to receive upon such consolidation, merger or sale; and, in such case, appropriate
adjustment (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) shall be made in the application of the

who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend) or other distribution, any right to
subscribe for, purchase, or otherwise acquire any shares of stock of any class or any other securities or
property, or to receive any other right, the Company shall mail to each holder of Preferred Stock at least
ten (10) days prior to the date specified therein a notice specifying the date on which any such record is to
be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or right, and the amount and character of such
dividend, distribution or right.

(k) Waiver of Adjustment of Conversion Price. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, any downward adjustment of the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock

sufficient to effect the payment of such dividend; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, as applicable, shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock or the payment of the dividend, as applicable, in
