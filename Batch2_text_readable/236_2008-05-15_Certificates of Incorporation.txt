4.Voting; Election of Majority of Directors.

(a)Voting. Except as otherwise expressly provided in Article Fifth or
elsewhere herein or as required by law, the holders of each share of Series C Preferred Stock,
each share of Series B Preferred Stock and each share of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to
vote on all matters upon which holders of Common Stock have the right to vote and with respect
to such vote, are entitled to notice of any stockholders’ meeting in accordance with the Bylaws of
the Corporation, and are entitled to a number of votes equal to the largest number of full shares
of Common Stock into which such shares of Series C Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock
and Series A Preferred Stock, as applicable, could be converted, pursuant to the provisions of
Section 5 below, at the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote on such
matters or, if no such record date is established, at the date such vote is taken or any written
consent of stockholders is first solicited.

(b)Directors. The Corporation shall have no more than nine (9) directors.
The holders of a majority of Series B Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, shall at all times
be entitled to elect a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Corporation,

Stock, voting as a separate class, shall at all times be entitled to elect two (2) directors as a

5.Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock have the following conversion
rights (the "Conversion Rights"):

(a)Optional Conversion. Each share of Series C Preferred Stock is
convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such
share, at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent, into one (the “Series C Conversion
Ratio’’) fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock. Each share of Series B Preferred
Stock is convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of

7304663_9.D0C 5
such share, at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent, into one (the “Series B
Conversion Ratio”) fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock. Each share of Series
A Preferred Stock is convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of
issuance of such share, at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent, into one (“Series A
Conversion Ratio”) fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock.

(b)Mandatory Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock will be
automatically converted into Common Stock upon the occurrence of the closing of an
underwritten public offering at a price to the public of at least $2.50 per share (subject to
appropriate adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, combinations and other similar
recapitalizations affecting such shares), resulting in net proceeds to the Corporation of not less
than $50 million (“Qualified Public Offering’) covering the sale of Common Stock to the
public.

(c)Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall
be issued upon conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional share to which a holder
of Preferred Stock would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay to the holder of the
shares of Preferred Stock which were converted a cash adjustment in respect of such fractional
shares in an amount equal to the same fraction of the market price per share of the Common
Stock (as determined in good faith and in a reasonable manner prescribed by the Board of
Directors) at the close of business on the date of such conversion. Before any holder of Preferred
Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into full shares of Common Stock, the holder shall
surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed for transfer, at the office of the
Corporation or of any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the
Corporation of such election to convert the same or the holder shall notify the Corporation that
such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and shall execute an agreement satisfactory
to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection
therewith. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver to such
holder of Preferred Stock a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock
to which he, she or it shall be entitled as aforesaid and a check payable to the holder in cash for
amounts payable in order to avoid a conversion into fractional shares of Common Stock. Except
as provided herein for a mandatory conversion, such conversion shall be deemed to have been
made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of
Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record
holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date.

(d)Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If the Corporation
effects a subdivision or reduction of the outstanding Common Stock, or issues Common Stock as
a dividend, the Series C Conversion Ratio, the Series B Conversion Ratio, and the Series A
Conversion Ratio then in effect immediately before such subdivision will be proportionately
increased or decreased.

(e)Adjustments for Dividends and Distributions. If the Corporation at any
time or from time to time after the date on which a share of the Series C Preferred Stock, a share
of Series B Preferred Stock or a share of Series A Preferred Stock, as applicable, is issued (such
date being the share’s “Issuance Date”) makes or issues, or fixes a record date for the

7304663_9.DOC 6
determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution
payable in securities of the Corporation other than shares of Common Stock then, and in each
such event, provision must be made so that the holders of Series C Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock and Series A Preferred Stock will receive upon conversion thereof in addition to
the number of shares of Common Stock receivable thereupon, the amount of securities of the
Corporation that they would have received had their shares of Series C Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock or shares of Series A Preferred Stock, as applicable, been converted into
Common Stock on the date of such event and had thereafter, during the period from the date of
such event to and including the conversion date retained such securities receivable by them as
aforesaid during such period giving application to all adjustments called for during such period
under this Section 5 with respect to the rights of the holders of such Preferred Stock.

(f}Adjustment for Reclassification Exchange or Substitution. If the
Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred

Stock or the Series A Preferred Stock is changed into the same or a different number of shares of
any class or classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise
(other than a subdivision or combination of shares or stock dividend provided for in Sections
5(d) and (e) above, or Section 5(g) below) then, and in each such event, the holder of each share
of Series C Preferred Stock, each share of Series B Preferred Stock and cach share of Series A
Preferred Stock, as applicable, will have the right thereafter to convert such shares into the kind
and amounts of shares of stock and other securities and property receivable upon such
reorganization, reclassification or other change, by holders of the numbers of shares of Common
Stock into which such shares of Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately prior to
such reorganization, reclassification or change, all subject to further adjustment as provided in
this Section 5.

(g)Reorganization, Consolidation. If at any time or from time to time after
a share’s Issuance Date there is a capital reorganization of the Common Stock (other than a
subdivision, combination, reclassification or exchange of shares provided for elsewhere in this
Section 5) (each a “Reorganization Event’) and if as a part of such Reorganization Event the
Series C Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock or the Series A Preferred Stock, as
applicable, is not canceled, exchanged, redeemed or otherwise retired then provision will be
made so that the holders of such shares of Preferred Stock will thereafter be entitled to receive
upon conversion of their shares of Preferred Stock the number of shares of stock or other
securities or property of the Corporation, or of the successor corporation resulting from such
Reorganization Event, to which a holder of that number of shares of Common Stock deliverable
upon conversion of such Preferred Stock would have been entitled on such Reorganization
Event. In any such case, appropriate adjustment will be made in the application of the provisions
of this Section 5 with respect to the rights of the holders of such Preferred Stock after the
Reorganization Event to the end that the provisions of this Section 5 are applicable after that
event as nearly equivalently as may be practicable.

(h)Reservation of Shares. The Corporation will at all times reserve and
keep available, out of its authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock, solely for the
purpose of effecting the conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and
the Series A Preferred Stock, such number of shares of its Common Stock, free of preemptive
rights, as are sufficient to effect the conversion of all shares of Series C Preferred Stock, Series B

7304663_9.DOC 7
Preferred Stock and Series A Preferred Stock from time to time outstanding. As a condition
precedent to the taking of any action which would cause an adjustment to the Series C
Conversion Ratio, Series B Conversion Ratio or the Series A Conversion Ratio, the Corporation
will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as are sufficient to
enable it to validly and legally issue the shares of its Common Stock that are issuable based upon
such adjusted Series C Conversion Ratio, Series B Conversion Ratio or Series A Conversion
Ratio, as applicable.

6.Mandatory Redemption. If there has not been a sale of the Corporation
pursuant to a transaction, or series of related transactions, in which any person, other than
an affiliate of the holders of Series B Preferred Stock, acquires (a) at least eighty percent
(80%) of the capital stock of the Corporation (whether by merger, consolidation or sale or
transfer of the Corporation's capital stock) or (b) at least eighty percent (80%) of the
Corporation's assets determined on a consolidated basis outside the ordinary course of
business (such event being, a “Sale of the Company”) or the Corporation has not
undertaken a Qualified Public Offering within five years from the date of the first
issuance of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock pursuant to the Series C Preferred
Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of the Effective Date (the “Purchase Agreement”),
the holders of Series C Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock may, in their sole
and individual discretion, deliver a sale notice (“‘Put Notice”) to the Corporation and the
holders of Series A Preferred Stock specifying that they desire to sell their shares of
Series C Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, as the case may be, to the
Corporation. Within ten business days from delivery of the Put Notice, any holder of
Series A Preferred Stock may deliver notice to the Corporation that such holder desires to
participate in such sale and to sell their shares of Series A Preferred Stock to the
Corporation. Subject to any limitations imposed by the DGCL, the Corporation must, in
accordance with this Section 6, purchase the shares of Preferred Stock being sold to it and
must undertake such actions as may be required to conclude such sale as soon as is
administratively feasible after determination of the purchase price but in no event later
than 30 calendar days after any such determination is made. The purchase price for the
shares of Preferred Stock shall be the greater of (a) their then fair market value as
determined by an independent appraiser, or investment banker, reasonably acceptable in
good faith to the holders of Preferred Stock and Common Stock, which will be binding
upon the parties, or (b) at such holder of Preferred Stock’s option, at a price equal to their
original purchase price (plus any accrued but unpaid dividends) times the number of
shares of Preferred Stock held by the holder (the “Put Price’).

7.Restrictions and Limitations.

(a)So long as any shares of Series C Preferred Stock and Series B
Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the Corporation will not, without the vote or written consent
of the holders of a majority (“Majority Holders’) of the then outstanding shares of Series C
Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock voting together as a single class:

(i) authorize or issue any class or series of stock having any
preferences or priority that is pari passu with or superior to

7304663_9.DOC 8
(ii)

any such preference or priority of Series C Preferred Stock
or Series B Preferred Stock; or

amend the Certificate of Incorporation, any Certificate of
Designations or Bylaws of the Corporation in a manner that
materially and adversely affects the rights, preferences or
privileges of the Series C Preferred Stock or Series B
Preferred Stock, or increases or decreases the authorized
number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock or Series B
Preferred Stock.

(b)For so long as not fewer than thirty percent (30%) of the shares of
Series A Preferred Stock as of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Redemption Agreement remain outstanding, the Corporation will not, without the vote or written

consent of the Required Holders:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)

7304663_9.DOC

authorize or issue any other class or series of stock having
any preferences or priority that is pari passu with or
superior to any such preference or priority of Series A
Preferred Stock;

amend the Certificate of Incorporation, any Certificate of
Designations or Bylaws of the Corporation in a manner that
materially and adversely affects the rights, preferences or
privileges of the Series A Preferred Stock, or increases or
decreases the authorized number of shares of Series A
Preferred Stock;

directly or indirectly declare or pay any dividends or other
distributions on its capital stock or repurchase or redeem
any of its capital stock except as provided for in (i) the
Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement, dated as
of the Effective Date, by and among the Corporation and its
stockholders (the “Stockholders Agreement”) and (ii) the
Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement,
dated as of the Effective Date, by and among the
Corporation and its stockholders (the “Registration Rights
Agreement’) for so long as any such agreement is in effect;
or

Corporation sells, licenses, transfers, pledges or encumbers
any of its proprietary technology or intellectual property to
any holder of Series B Preferred Stock or any direct or
indirect affiliate of such holder; or

(v) change the number of individuals who shall comprise the
Board of Directors, or change any procedure of the
Corporation related to the designation, nomination or
election of the directors to the Board of Directors contained
herein or in the Stockholders Agreement.

8.No Dilution or Impairment. The Corporation will not, by amendment of its
Certificate of Incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets,
consolidation, merger, dissolution, issuance or sale of securities or any other voluntary
action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of the
Preferred Stock set forth herein, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying
out of all such terms and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or
appropriate in order to protect the rights and privileges of the holders of the Preferred
Stock. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Corporation (a) will not
increase the par value of any shares of stock receivable on the conversion of the Preferred
Stock above the amount payable therefore on such conversion, and (b) will take all such
action as may be necessary or appropriate in order that the Corporation may validly and
legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock on the conversion of
all Preferred Stock from time to time outstanding.

9.Participation Rights. Subject to the terms and conditions specified in this
Section 9, and applicable securities laws, the Corporation shall not issue or sell any
shares of any of its capital stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for
any shares of its capital stock, issue or grant any options or warrants for the purchase of,
or enter into any agreements providing for the issuance (contingent or otherwise) of, any
of its capital stock or any stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for any
shares of its capital stock (each an “Issuance” of “New Securities”), except in
compliance with the following:

(a)The Corporation shall deliver a notice (the “Participation Notice’) to
each holder of capital stock of the Corporation (“Participation Offeree”) stating (i) its bona fide
intention to offer such New Securities, (ii) the number of such New Securities to be offered,
including the maximum number of shares of Common Stock for which or into which such New
Securities may at such date of determination be exercised, converted or exchanged and (iii) the
price and terms, if any, upon which it proposes to offer such New Securities.

(b)By written notification received by the Corporation within ten (10)
calendar days after mailing of the Participation Notice, each of the Participation Offerees may
elect to purchase or obtain, at the price and on the terms specified in the Offer Notice, up to that
portion of such New Securities which equals the proportion that the number of shares of
Common Stock issued and held, or issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock (and any
other securities convertible into, or otherwise exercisable or exchangeable for, shares of
Common Stock) then held by such Participation Offeree bears to the total number of shares of

7304663_9.DOC 10
Common Stock of the Corporation then outstanding (assuming full conversion and exercise of all
outstanding convertible or exercisable securities). Each Participation Offeree who does not so
accept such offer within the time period specified shall be deemed to have waived all rights with
respect to the Issuance.

(c)The Corporation shall promptly inform, in writing, each Participation
Offeree that elects to purchase all of the shares available to it (each, a “Fully Exercising
Offeree”’) of any other Participation Offeree’s failure to do likewise. During the ten (10)
calendar day period commencing after receipt of such information, each Fully-Exercising
Offeree shall be entitled to obtain that portion of the New Securities for which the Participation
Offerees were entitled to subscribe but which were not subscribed for by the Participation
Offerees which is equal to the proportion that the number of shares of Common Stock issued and
held, or issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock (and any other securities convertible
into, or otherwise exercisable or exchangeable for, shares of Common Stock) then held by such
Fully Exercising Offeree bears to the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and held,
or issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock (and any other securities convertible into, or
otherwise exercisable or exchangeable for, shares of Common Stock) then held, by all Fully
Exercising Offerees who wish to purchase such unsubscribed shares.

(d)If all New Securities referred to in the Participation Notice are not
elected to be purchased or obtained as provided in Section 9(a) and Section 9(b) above, the
Corporation shall thereafter be free to issue the remaining unsubcribed portion of the New
Securities in the Issuance, not otherwise subscribed for by the Participation Offerees, to the third
party at a price no less than the minimum price set forth in the Participation Notice and on other
principal terms not substantially more favorable than those set forth in the Participation Notice,
without any further obligation to such non-accepting Participation Offerees.

(e)The right of participation in this Section 9 shall not be applicable to:
(i) up to 7,515,904 shares of Common Stock (appropriately adjusted for any stock split, stock
dividend, combination or other recapitalization effected after the date hereof) issued or deemed
issued to employees or directors of, or consultants to, the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries
pursuant to a plan, agreement, or arrangement approved by the Board of Directors; (ii) shares of
Common Stock issued in an underwritten public offering; (iii) the issuance of securities pursuant
to the conversion or exercise of convertible or exercisable securities existing as of the Effective
Date and issued pursuant to the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement; (iv)
securities issued in connection with any stock split or stock dividend of the Corporation; (v) the
issuance of securities in connection with a bona fide business acquisition of or by the
Corporation, whether by merger, consolidation, sale of assets, sale or exchange of stock or
otherwise, which acquisition is approved by the Board of Directors and in compliance with this
Certificate of Incorporation and (vi) any issuance if the application of this Section 9 to such
issuance is waived in writing by the majority of holders of Series C Preferred Stock and Series B
Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class, and the Required Holders.

10.Amendment.
(a)Without the vote or written consent of the holders of a majority of the

then outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock,

5:The Corporation is to have perpetual existence.

6:Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed between the Corporation and its
creditors or any class of them and/or between the Corporation and its stockholders or any class of
them, any court of equitable jurisdiction within the State of Delaware may, on the application in
a summary way of the Corporation or of any creditor or stockholder thereof or on the application
of any receiver or receivers appointed for the Corporation under the provisions of Section 291 of
Title 8 of the Delaware Code or on the application of trustees in dissolution or of any receiver or
receivers appointed for the Corporation under the provisions of Section 279 of Title 8 of the
Delaware Code order a meeting of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders
or class of stockholders of the Corporation, as the case may be, to be summoned in such manner
as the said court directs. If a majority in number representing three-fourths (3/4) in value of the
creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of the
Corporation, as the case may be, agree to any compromise or arrangement and to any
reorganization of the Corporation as consequence of such compromise or arrangement, the said
compromise or arrangement and the said reorganization shall, if sanctioned by the court to which
the said application has been made, be binding on all the creditors or class of creditors and/or on
all the stockholders or class of stockholders of the Corporation, as the case may be, and also on
the Corporation.

7:Meetings of stockholders may be held within or outside the State of Delaware, as the
Bylaws may provide. The books of the Corporation may be kept (subject to any provision
contained in the statutes) outside the State of Delaware at such place or places as may be
designated from time to time by the Board or in the Bylaws of the Corporation. Elections of
directors need not be by written ballot unless the Bylaws of the Corporation shall so provide.

8:Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Certificate of Incorporation, the
Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this
Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights
conferred upon stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.

9:No director shall be personally liable to the Corporation or any of its stockholders for
monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability (a) for any

7304663_9.DOC 12
breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (b) for acts or
omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of
law, (c) under Section 174 of the DGCL, or (d) for any transaction from which the director
derived an improper personal benefit. If the DGCL hereafter is amended to authorize the further
elimination or limitation of the liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the
Corporation, in addition to the limitations on personal liability provided herein, shall be limited
to the fullest extent permitted by the amended DGCL. Any repeal or modification of this Article
shall be prospective only, and shall not adversely affect any limitation on the personal liability of
a director of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification.

10:

A.Each person who was or is made a party to or is threatened to be made a party to or is
involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(hereinafter a proceeding”), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person of whom he or she
is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at
the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or
of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to
employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official
capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a
director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation
to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended
(but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the
Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to
provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys’
fees, judgments, fines, ERISA, excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in
settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith and such
indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee
or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators; provided,
however, that, except as provided in this Article Tenth, the Corporation shall indemnify any such
person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by
such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board. The right to
indemnification conferred in this Article Tenth shall be a contract right and shall include the
right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in
advance of its final disposition; provided, further, that if the DGCL requires, the payment of such
expenses incurred by a director or officer in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in
any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a director or officer,
including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final
disposition of a proceeding shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an
undertaking, by or on behalf of such director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it
Shall ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under
this Article or otherwise. The Corporation may, by action of its Board, provide indemnification
to employees and agents of the Corporation with the same scope and effect as the foregoing
indemnification of directors and officers.

B.If a claim under Article Tenth is not paid in full by the Corporation within thirty (30)
days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time

7304663_9.DOC 13
thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if
successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of
prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to
enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final
disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the
Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible
under the DGCL for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the
burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the
Corporation (including its Board, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a
determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is
proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set
forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board,
independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable
standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has
not met the applicable standard of conduct.

C.The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in defending a
proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this Article shall not be exclusive of
any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of
this Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested
directors or otherwise.

D.The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any
director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise against any such expense, liability or loss, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or
loss under the Delaware General Corporation Law.

E.As used in this Article Tenth, references to “the Corporation” shall include, in addition
to the resulting or surviving corporation, any constituent corporation absorbed in a consolidation
or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to
indemnify its directors, officers, employees and agents, so that any person who is or was a
director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the
request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position
under the provisions of this Article with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he
would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.

F.If this Article or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of
competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each director, officer,
employee and agent of the Corporation as to expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments,
fines and amounts paid in settlement with respect to any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, including a grand jury proceeding and an action by the
Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article that shall not
have been invalidated or by any other applicable law.

11:Severability of Provisions. Whenever possible, each provision of this Certificate Of
Incorporation, as same may hereafter be amended, will be interpreted in a manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision hereof is held to be prohibited by or
invalid under applicable law, such provision will be ineffective only to the extent of such
prohibition or invalidity without invalidating or otherwise adversely affecting the remaining
provisions hereof. If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that a provision hereof would
be valid or enforceable if a period of time were extended or shortened or a particular percentage
were increased or decreased, then such court may make such change as is necessary to render the
provision in question effective and valid under applicable law.

12:Except as expressly otherwise provided by the DGCL, this Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, any Certificate of Designations, the Bylaws or the Stockholders
Agreement, all action of the stockholders by class must be by majority vote.

7304663_9.D0C 15

Restated Certificate of Incorporation on this 14th day of May, 2008.
