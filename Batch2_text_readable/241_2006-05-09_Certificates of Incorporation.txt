COPY)_(PALIB2_3407973_7).DOC -4-
(c) Shares not Treated as Both Preferred Stock and Common Stock in any
Distribution. Shares of Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to be converted into shares of Common
Stock in order to participate in any Distribution, or series of Distributions, as shares of Common
Stock, without first foregoing participation in the Distribution, or series of Distributions, as shares of
Preferred Stock as set forth in Section 3(a).

(d) Reorganization. For purposes of this Section 3, a “Liquidation Event” shall be
deemed to be occasioned by, or to include, (a) the acquisition of the Corporation by another entity by
means of any transaction or series of related transactions to which the Corporation is party
(including, without limitation, any stock acquisition, reorganization, merger or consolidation but
excluding any sale of stock for capital raising purposes) other than a transaction or series of
transactions in which the holders of the voting securities of the Corporation outstanding immediately
prior to such transaction continue to retain (either by such voting securities remaining outstanding or
by such voting securities being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity), as a result of
shares in the Corporation held by such holders prior to such transaction, at least fifty percent (50%)
of the total voting power represented by the voting securities of the Corporation or such surviving
entity outstanding immediately after such transaction or series of transactions; (b) a sale, lease or
other conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation or a worldwide exclusive
license of all or substantially all of the intellectual property of the Corporation in all or substantially
all fields of use; or (c) any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, whether
voluntary or involuntary. The treatment of any particular transaction or series of related transactions
as a Liquidation Event may be waived by the vote or written consent of the holders of at least 60%
of the outstanding Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class.

(ec) Valuation of Non-Cash Consideration. If any assets of the Corporation
distributed to stockholders in connection with any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the
Corporation are other than cash, then the value of such assets shall be their fair market value as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, except that any publicly-traded securities to be
distributed to stockholders in a Liquidation Event be valued as follows:

(i) If the securities are then traded on a national securities exchange or the
Nasdaq Stock Market (or a similar national quotation system), then the value of the securities shall
be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange or system over
the ten (10) trading day period ending five (5) trading days prior to the Distribution;

(ii) if the securities are actively traded over-the-counter, then the value of
the securities shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid prices of the securities over the ten
(10) trading day period ending five (5) trading days prior to the Distribution.

In the event of a merger or other acquisition of the Corporation by another entity, the
Distribution date shall be deemed to be the date such transaction closes.

For the purposes of this subsection 3(e), “trading day” shall mean any day which the
exchange or system on which the securities to be distributed are traded is open and “closing prices”
or “closing bid prices” shall be deemed to be: (i) for securities traded primarily on the New York
Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or Nasdagq, the last reported trade price or sale price,

CADocuments and Settings\jgriffit\Local Settings\Temporary Intemet Files\OLK3F5\AESTHERx - Certificate of Incorporation (Series BKEXECUTION
COPY)_(PALIB2_3407973_7).DOC -5-
as the case may be, at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on that day and (ii) for securities listed or traded on
other exchanges, markets and systems, the last reported trade price or sale price as of the end of the
regular hours trading period for such exchange, market or system. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
after the date hereof, the closing price as of the end of the regular hours trading period for any
relevant exchange, market or system as of a given trading day shall be determined in a different
manner than as set forth above, then the fair market value shall be determined to be the closing price
of the stock as of such other established end of the regular hours trading period for such exchange,
market, or system. However, if the definitive agreement for a Liquidation Event values the
securities to be received by the Corporation’s stockholders based on different time periods from
those set forth above, the fair market value shall be determined as of the time periods set forth in
such definitive agreement, notwithstanding anything in this subsection 3(e) to the contrary.

4. Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as
follows:

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the
option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share at the office of the
Corporation or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, into that number of fully-paid,
nonassessable shares of Common Stock determined by dividing the Original Issue Price for the
Preferred Stock by the Conversion Price for the Preferred Stock. (The number of shares of Common
Stock into which each share of Preferred Stock may be converted is hereinafter referred to as the
“Conversion Rate” for each such series.) Upon any decrease or increase in the Conversion Price
for the Preferred Stock, as described in this Section 4, the Conversion Rate for the Preferred Stock
shall be appropriately increased or decreased.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be
converted into fully-paid, non-assessable shares of Common Stock at the then effective Conversion
Rate for such share (i) immediately prior to the closing of a firm commitment underwritten initial
public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the “Securities Act’’), covering the offer and sale of the Corporation’s Common Stock,
provided that the offering price per share is not less than $8.63 (as adjusted for Recapitalizations)
and the aggregate gross proceeds to the Corporation are not less than $30,000,000 (before deduction
of underwriters’ commissions and expenses), or (ii) upon the receipt by the Corporation of a written
request for such conversion that is executed by the holders of at least 60% of the Preferred Stock
then outstanding, voting together as a class (each of the events referred to in (i) and (ii) are referred
to herein as an “Automatic Conversion Event’).

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be
issued upon conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder
would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the
then fair market value of a share of Common Stock as determined by the Board of Directors. For
such purpose, all shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder of Preferred Stock shall be
aggregated, and any resulting fractional share of Common Stock shall be paid in cash. Before any
holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into full shares of Common Stock, and
to receive certificates therefor, such holder shall either (A) surrender the certificate or certificates
therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for the Preferred

CADocuments and Settings\jgriffit\Local Settings\Temporary Intemet Files\OLK3FS\AESTHERx - Certificate of Incorporation (Series BKEXECUTION
COPY)_(PALIB2_3407973_7). DOC -6-
Stock or (B) notify the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen
or destroyed and execute an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation
from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates, and shall give written notice to the
Corporation at such office that such holder elects to convert the same; provided, however. that on the
date of an Automatic Conversion Event, the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted
automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the
certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent;
provided further, however, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing
the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such Automatic Conversion Event unless either the
certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are delivered to the Corporation or its transfer
agent as provided above, or the holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such
certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the
Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such
certificates. On the date of the occurrence of an Automatic Conversion Event, each holder of record
of shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion, notwithstanding that the certificates representing such shares of
Preferred Stock shall not have been surrendered at the office of the Corporation, that notice from the
Corporation shall not have been received by any holder of record of shares of Preferred Stock, or
that the certificates evidencing such shares of Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered to
such holder.

The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after such delivery, or after such agreement and
indemnification, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as
aforesaid and a check payable to the holder in the amount of any cash amounts payable as the result
of a conversion into fractional shares of Common Stock, plus any declared and unpaid dividends on
the converted Preferred Stock. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately
prior to the close of business on the date of delivery of the notice of conversion set forth above, and
the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion
shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on
such date: provided, however, that if the conversion is in connection with an underwritten offer of
securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act or a merger, sale, financing, or liquidation of the
Corporation or other event, the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering Preferred
Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing of such transaction or upon the occurrence of
such event, in which case the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such
conversion of the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until
immediately prior to the closing of such transaction or the occurrence of such event.

(d) Adjustments to Conversion Price for Diluting Issues.

(i) Special Definition. For purposes of this paragraph 4(d), “Additional
Shares of Common” shall mean all shares of Common Stock issued (or, pursuant to paragraph
4(d)(iii), deemed to be issued) by the Corporation after the filing of this Amended and Restated

C:\Documents and Settings\jgriffit\Local Settings\Temporary Internet Files\OLK3F5\AESTHERx - Certificate of Incorporation (Series BKEXECUTION
COPY)_(PALIB2_3407973_7).DOC -8-
the then outstanding Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, agree in writing (prospectively or
retrospectively) shall not constitute Additional Shares of Common.

(ii) | No Adjustment of Conversion Price. No adjustment in the Conversion
Price of any series of Preferred Stock shall be made in respect of the issuance of Additional Shares

Additional Share of Common issued or deemed to be issued by the Corporation is less than the
Conversion Price in effect on the date of, and immediately prior to such issue, for such series of
Preferred Stock.

(iii) | Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall issue any Options or
Convertible Securities or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of
securities entitled to receive any such Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum number
of shares (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto without regard to any provisions contained
therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of
such Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities, the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities or, in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such
Options and the conversion or exchange of the underlying securities, shall be deemed to have been
issued as of the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close

of business on such record date, provided that in any such case in which shares are deemed to be
issued:

(1) no further adjustment in the Conversion Price of the Preferred
Stock shall be made upon the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities or shares of Common Stock
in connection with the exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities;

(2) if such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms
provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any change in the consideration payable to the
Corporation or in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or
exchange thereof (other than a change pursuant to the anti-dilution provisions of such Options or
Convertible Securities such as this Section 4(d) or pursuant to Recapitalization provisions of such
Options or Convertible Securities such as Sections 4(e), 4(f) and 4(g) hereof), the Conversion Price
of the Preferred Stock and any subsequent adjustments based thereon shall be recomputed to reflect
such change as if such change had been in effect as of the original issue thereof (or upon the
occurrence of the record date with respect thereto):

(3) no readjustment pursuant to clause (2) above shall have the
effect of increasing the Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock to an amount above the Conversion
Price that would have resulted from any other issuances of Additional Shares of Common and any

other adjustments provided for herein between the original adjustment date and such readjustment
date;

(4) —_ upon the expiration of any such Options or any rights of
conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have been exercised, the

CADocuments and Settings\jgriffit\Local Settings\Temporary Internet Files\OLK3F5\AESTHER« - Certificate of Incorporation (Series BXEXECUTION
COPY)_(PALIB2_3407973_7).DOC -9-
Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon the
occurrence of a record date with respect thereto) and any subsequent adjustments based thereon
shall, upon such expiration, be recomputed as if:

(a) in the case of Convertible Securities or Options for
Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common issued were the shares of Common Stock, if
any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities and the consideration received therefor was the consideration actually
received by the Corporation for the issue of such exercised Options plus the consideration actually
received by the Corporation upon such exercise or for the issue of all such Convertible Securities
which were actually converted or exchanged, plus the additional consideration, if any, actually
received by the Corporation upon such conversion or exchange, and

(b) in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, only
the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were issued at the time of
issue of such Options, and the consideration received by the Corporation for the Additional Shares of
Common deemed to have been then issued was the consideration actually received by the
Corporation for the issue of such exercised Options, plus the consideration deemed to have been
received by the Corporation (determined pursuant to Section 4(d)(v)) upon the issue of the
Convertible Securities with respect to which such Options were actually exercised; and

(5) if such record date shall have been fixed and such Options or
Convertible Securities are not issued on the date fixed therefor, the adjustment previously made in
the Conversion Price which became effective on such record date shall be canceled as of the close of
business on such record date, and thereafter the Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this
paragraph 4(d)(iii) as of the actual date of their issuance.

(iv) Adjustment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional Shares
of Common. In the event the Corporation shall issue Additional Shares of caning including

Additional Shares of Common deemed to be issu suant to paragraph 4(d)(i11)/without
consideration or for a consideration per share less than tht Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock
in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such issue, then, the Conversion Price of the
Preferred Stock shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue_t e (calculated to the nearest
cent) determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by#fraction, the numerator of which shall
be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding jffmediately prior to such issue plus the
number of shares which the Aggregate Consideration s‘defitied : in Section 4(d)(v) below) received
by the Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of Common so issued would purchase
at such Conversion Price, and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of such Additional Shares of
Common so issued. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Conversion Price shall not be reduced at
such time if the amount of such reduction would be less than $0.01, but any such amount shall be
carried forward, and a reduction will be made with respect to such amount at the time of, and
together with, any subsequent reduction which, together with such amount and any other amounts so
carried forward, equal $0.01 or more in the aggregate. For the purposes of this Subsection 4(d)(iv),
all shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock

C:\Documents and Settings\jgriffit\Local Settings\Temporary Internet Files\OLK3FS\AESTHERx - Certificate of Incorporation (Series BMEXECUTION
COPY)_(PALIB2_3407973_7). DOC -10-
and the exercise and/or conversion of any other outstanding Convertible Securities and all
outstanding Options shall be deemed to be outstanding.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this subsection 4(d),
the “Aggregate Consideration” received by the Corporation for the issue (or deemed issue) of any
Additional Shares of Common shall be computed as follows:

(1) Cash and Property. Such consideration shall:

(a) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
aggregate amount of cash received by the Corporation before deducting any reasonable discounts,
commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the Corporation for any underwriting or
otherwise in connection with such issuance;

(b) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair market value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors; and

(c) in the event Additional Shares of Common are issued
together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for consideration which
covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in clauses (a)
and (b) above, as reasonably determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(2) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per

share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common deemed to have been issued
pursuant to paragraph 4(d)(iii) shall be determined by dividing

(x) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Corporation as
consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the minimum aggregate
amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to
any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration) payable to the
Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options for
Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities by

(y) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set forth in the
instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent
adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities.

(e) Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of Common Stock. In the event
the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided (by stock split, by payment of a stock
dividend or otherwise), into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price of
the Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall, concurrently with the
effectiveness of such subdivision, be proportionately decreased. In the event the outstanding shares
of Common Stock shal] be combined (by reclassification or otherwise) into a lesser number of shares

CADocuments and Settings\jgriffit\Local Settings\Temporary Internet Files\OLK3FS\AESTHER« - Certificate of Incorporation (Series BKEXECUTION
COPY)_(PALIB2_3407973_7).DOC -11-

equal to the Original Issue Price for such Preferred Stock, plus an amount per share equal to 8% of

redeem on any one (1) Redemption Date shall be equal to the amount determined by dividing: (a) the
aggregate number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Redemption
Date for which redemption is requested hereunder by (b) the number of remaining Redemption
Dates (including the Redemption Date to which such calculation applies).

(b) Any redemption effected pursuant to Section 5(a) shall be made on a pro rata
basis among the holders of the Preferred Stock requesting redemption hereunder in proportion to the
shares of Preferred Stock then held by them.

(c) At least fifteen (15), but no more than thirty (30) days prior to each Redemption
Date, written notice shall be mailed. first class postage prepaid, to each holder of record (at the close

redeemed from such holder, the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price, the place at which
payment may be obtained and calling upon such holder to surrender to the Corporation, in the
manner and at the place designated, the holder’s certificate or certificates representing the shares to
be redeemed (the “Redemption Notice’’). Except as provided herein, on or after the Redemption
Date each holder of Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall surrender to the Corporation the certificate
or certificates representing such shares, in the manner and at the place designated in the Redemption
Notice, and thereupon the Redemption Price of such shares shall be payable to the order of the
person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof and each
surrendered certificate shall be cancelled. In the event less than all the shares represented by any
such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares.

default in payment of the Redemption Price, all rights of the holders of shares of Preferred Stock
designated for redemption in the Redemption Notice as holders of Preferred Stock to be redeemed
(except the right to receive the Redemption Price without interest upon surrender of their certificate
or certificates) shall cease with respect to the shares designated for redemption on such date, and
such shares shall not thereafter be transferred on the books of the Corporation or be deemed to be
outstanding for any purpose whatsoever. If the funds of the Corporation legally available for
redemption of shares of Preferred Stock on any Redemption Date are insufficient to redeem the total
number of shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such date, those funds which are legally
available will be used to redeem the maximum possible number of such shares ratably among the
holders of such shares to be redeemed based upon their holdings of Preferred Stock. The shares of
Preferred Stock not redeemed shall remain outstanding and entitled to all the rights and preferences
provided herein. At any time thereafter when additional funds of the Corporation are legally
available for the redemption of shares of Preferred Stock such funds will immediately be used to
redeem the balance of the shares which the Corporation has become obliged to redeem on any
Redemption Date, but which it has not redeemed.
