AMENDED AND RESTATED
ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION
OF
ATHENIX CORP.

The name of the Corporation is Athenix Corp. (the “Corporation’).
ARTICLE I

The address of the registered office of the Corporation in the State of North Carolina is
2500 First Union Capitol Center, Raleigh, NC 27601, Wake County, and the name of its
registered agent at such address is Gerald F. Roach, Esq.

ARTICLE III

The purpose of this Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which
corporations may be organized under the General Corporation Law of North Carolina.

ARTICLE IV

A. Classes of Stock. The Corporation is authorized to issue two classes of shares to
be designated, respectively, “Common Stock” and “Preferred Stock.” The total number of
shares of capital stock that the Corporation shall have authority to issue is Fifty Million
(50,000,000). The total number of shares of Common Stock the Corporation shall have authority
to issue is Thirty Million (30,000,000) shares, $0.01 par value per share. The total number of
shares of Preferred Stock the Corporation shall have authority to issue is Twenty Million
(20,000,000) shares, $0.01 par value per share, of which Eight Million One Hundred
Twenty-Five Thousand (8,125,000) shares shall be designated Series A Preferred Stock (the
“Series A Preferred Stock’).

B. Rights, Preferences and Restrictions of Preferred Stock. The Preferred Stock
authorized by this Certificate of Incorporation may be issued from time to time in one or more
series. The powers, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to and imposed on the
Series A Preferred Stock, are set forth in Article [V, Section C. The remaining shares of
Preferred Stock of the Corporation (if any) may be issued from time to time in one or more
series, the shares of each such series to have such designations, preferences, relative rights, and
powers, including voting powers, if any (or qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof) as
are stated in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issuance of such series adopted by the
Board of Directors of the Corporation. Authority is expressly granted to the Board of Directors,
subject to the provisions hereof and to any limitations provided under the Business Corporation
Act of North Carolina, to authorize the issuance of one or more series within a class of Preferred

Amendment to Articles. DOC
Stock, and with respect to each such series to determine and fix by resolution or resolutions the
designations, preferences, relative rights, and powers, including voting powers, full or limited, or
no voting power, of such shares, or the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such shares.
This paragraph is intended to afford to the Board of Directors the maximum authority permitted
under Section 55-6-02 of the North Carolina General Statutes.

C. Designated Preferred Stock.

The powers, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to and imposed on the
Series A Preferred Stock are as follows:

1. Dividends. (a) The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to receive dividends prior and in preference to any dividend on Common Stock or other
Preferred Stock at the rate of $0.08 per share (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations
or splits with respect to such shares) per annum, payable out of funds legally available therefor
(the “Base Series A Dividend”). Such dividends shall accrue and be cumulative beginning on the
date of issuance of such shares and shall be payable only when, as and if declared by the Board of
Directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no dividends shall accrue on the Preferred Stock after
the occurrence of a Seven Times Liquidity Event (as hereinafter defined) or the closing of the
sale of the Corporation’s Preferred Stock or securities convertible into Preferred Stock at a
purchase price of Seven Dollars ($7.00) or more per share of Preferred Stock (including, in the
case of convertible securities, the amount of additional consideration payable to the Corporation
upon exercise or conversion of such convertible securities) (as adjusted for stock splits, stock
dividends or combinations of similar events). No dividends (other than those payable solely in
Common Stock of the Corporation) shall be paid on any share of Common Stock during any
fiscal year of the Corporation until dividends in the total amount of $0.08 per share (as adjusted
for any stock dividends, combination or splits with respect to such shares) on the Series A
Preferred shall have been paid or declared and set apart during that fiscal year. Subject to the
foregoing and in the event dividends are paid on any share of Common Stock, the dividend shall
be paid with respect to all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, in an amount equal per
share (on an as-1f-converted to Common Stock basis) to the amount paid or set aside for each
share of Common Stock.

(b) In the event the Corporation shall declare a distribution (other than any
distribution described in Article IV, Section C.2) payable in securities of other persons, evidences
of indebtedness issued by the Corporation or other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or
options or rights to purchase any such securities or evidences of indebtedness), then, in each such
case the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any
such distribution as though the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock were the holders of the
number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation into which their respective shares of
Preferred Stock are convertible as of the record date fixed for the determination of the holders of
Common Stock of the Corporation entitled to receive such distribution.

Amendment to Articles. DOC
2. Liquidation Preference.

(a) Rights on Liquidation. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary (a “Liquidation Event’), the
holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any
distribution of any of the assets or surplus funds of the Corporation to the holders of Common
Stock and any series of Preferred Stock the terms of which specifically provide that such series
ranks junior and subordinate to the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to the distribution of
assets upon any liquidation or deemed liquidation, an amount equal to One Dollar ($1.00) per
share (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations and splits with respect to such shares)
(the “Original Issue Price’) plus all accrued or declared but unpaid dividends on such share for
each share of Series A Preferred Stock then held by them. If upon a Liquidation Event, the assets
and funds thus distributed among the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to
permit the payment to such holders of the full preferential amount, then the entire assets and
funds of the Corporation legally available for distribution shall be distributed ratably among the
holders of the Series A Preferred Stock in proportion to the preferential amount each such holder
is otherwise entitled to receive, provided, however, that no preference pursuant to this Article IV,
Section C.2(a) shall be paid to the holders of Preferred Stock if the proceeds of any Liquidation
Event payable to the holders of shares of any series of Preferred Stock pursuant to Article IV,
Section C.2(b) below would be greater than seven times (7x) the Original Issue Price per share,
assuming no payment is required to be made pursuant to this Article IV, Section C.2(a) (a “Seven
Times Liquidity Event’).

(b) Distribution of Remaining Assets. After payment to the holders of the
Series A Preferred Stock the amounts set forth in Article IV, Section C.2(a) above (unless the
proviso in the ultimate sentence of Article IV, Section C.2(a) shall apply, in which case no
payment is required to be made pursuant to such section), the entire remaining assets and funds
of the Corporation legally available for distribution, if any, shall be distributed among the holders
of the Common Stock and Series A Preferred Stock in proportion to the shares of Common Stock
then held by them and the shares of Common Stock which they then have the right to acquire
upon conversion of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by them.

(c) Certain Other Transactions. For purposes of this Article IV, Section C.2,
at the option of the holders of a majority of the Series A Preferred Stock, a liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation shall be deemed to be occasioned by, or to include,
(A) any transaction or series of transactions which results in the disposition to a single person or
group of affiliated persons of greater than fifty percent (50%) of the voting power of the
Corporation, (B) any acquisition of the Corporation effected by means of merger, consolidation,
share exchange or other form of corporate reorganization in which outstanding shares of the
Corporation are exchanged for securities or other consideration issued, or caused to be issued, by
the acquiring corporation or its affiliate or (C) a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Corporation (each such event, a “Combination’).

(d) Valuation of Non-Cash Assets. Whenever the distribution provided for in
this Article IV, Section C.2 shall be payable in securities or property other than cash, the value of

Amendment to Articles. DOC
such distribution shall be the fair market value of such securities or other property as determined
in good faith by the Board of Directors.

3. Voting Rights.

(a) Generally. Except as otherwise required by applicable law or as set forth
herein, the shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be voted equally with the shares of Common
Stock (voting together with the shares of Common Stock as a single class) at any annual or
special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, or may act by written consent in the same
manner as Common Stock, upon the following basis: each holder of one or more shares of Series
A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to notice of any stockholders' meeting in accordance with the
Bylaws of the Corporation and to such number of votes for the shares of such series of Preferred
Stock held by him immediately after the close of business on the record date fixed for such
meeting, or on the effective date of such written consent, as shall be equal to the number of
whole shares of Common Stock into which all of his shares of such series of Preferred Stock are
convertible immediately after the close of business on the record date fixed for such meeting or
the effective date of such written consent.

(b) Restrictions and Limitations. In addition to any other rights provided by
law, and notwithstanding any provision in this Certificate of Incorporation to the contrary, so
long as at least One Million (1,000,000) shares of Series A Preferred Stock remain outstanding,
the Corporation, without first obtaining the affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of a
majority of the then-outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock will not:

(i) take any action that may alter or change the designations, powers,
rights, preferences or privileges, or the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of the Series A
Preferred Stock;

(11) increase or decrease the authorized number of shares of any class
or series of the Company’s capital stock;

(iii) | authorize, issue, or become obligated to issue shares of any class or
series of stock or other securities having any preference, priority or parity as to dividends,
liquidation, redemption, conversion, voting, assets or other rights superior to or on parity with
any such preference or priority of the Series A Preferred Stock, or authorize, issue, or become
obligated to issue shares of stock of any class or series or any bonds, debentures, notes or other
obligations convertible into or exchangeable for, or having option rights to purchase, any shares
of stock of the Corporation having any preference, priority or parity as to dividends, liquidation,
redemption, conversion, voting, assets or other rights superior to or on parity with any such
preference or priority of the Series A Preferred Stock;

(iv) apply any of its assets to the redemption, retirement, purchase or
acquisition, directly or indirectly, through subsidiaries or otherwise, of any Preferred Stock
(except Series A Preferred Stock pursuant Article IV, Section C.5 below) or Common Stock
(except for repurchases from employees, directors, consultants or other persons performing

Amendment to Articles. DOC
services for the Corporation or any subsidiary pursuant to plans or other agreements approved by
the Board of Directors pursuant to which the Corporation has the option to repurchase such
shares upon the occurrence of certain events at a price per share equal to the original issue price
thereof);

(v) take any other action that may materially adversely affect the Series
A Preferred Stock;

(vi) materially change the fundamental nature of the business of the
Corporation;

(vii) effect any sale, lease, license, assignment, transfer or other
conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, or
any consolidation, merger, share exchange or other combination involving the Corporation which
results in the disposition to a single person or group of affiliated persons of greater than fifty
percent (50%) of the voting power of the Corporation;

(viii) amend or repeal any provision of, or add any provision to, the
Corporation’s Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws to the extent it materially and adversely affects
the Series A Preferred Stock;

(ix) the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation,
whether voluntary or involuntary;

(x) authorize the Corporation to sell its securities in a public offering
other than in a Qualified IPO (as hereinafter defined);

(xi) incur indebtedness or issue any securities evidencing indebtedness
in excess of Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000); or

(x11) declare, pay or set aside funds for the payment of, any dividend, or
other distribution other than the Base Series A Dividend.

4, Conversion. The holders of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall
have conversion rights as follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of each series of Preferred Stock shall be
convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share
at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for such stock. Each share of each series of
Preferred Stock shall be converted into the number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of
Common Stock as is determined by dividing the “Conversion Price” per share in effect for such
series of Preferred Stock at the time of conversion into the “Conversion Value” per share for
such series of Preferred Stock. The number of shares of Common Stock into which each share of
such series of Preferred Stock is convertible is hereinafter referred to as the “Conversion Rate.”
The initial Conversion Price per share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be One Dollar ($1.00).

Amendment to Articles. DOC
The initial Conversion Price of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment as set
forth in Article IV, Section C.4(d). The Conversion Value per share of Series A Preferred Stock
shall be One Dollar ($1.00). Any accrued or declared but unpaid dividends on the shares of
Series A Preferred Stock may be converted into the number of shares of Common Stock equal to
the amount of the accrued or declared but unpaid dividends divided by the Conversion Price per
share of Series A Preferred Stock.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of each series of Preferred Stock shall
automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the then-effective Conversion Rate
for such series of Preferred Stock, (i) immediately upon the closing of the sale of the
Corporation's Common Stock in a firm commitment, underwritten public offering registered
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act’), at a public offering price
(prior to underwriters' discounts and expenses) equal to or exceeding Seven Dollars ($7.00) per
share of Common Stock (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations or splits with respect
to such shares) and the aggregate gross proceeds to the Corporation (before deduction for
underwriters' discounts and expenses relating to the issuance) of which equal or exceed Thirty
Million Dollars ($30,000,000) (a “Qualified IPO”); or (ii) at the option of holders of a majority
of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of shares of any series of
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock, he shall
surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or
of any transfer agent for such stock, and shall give written notice to the Corporation at such
office that he elects to convert the same and shall state therein the name or names in which he
wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued. The Corporation
shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of shares of
Preferred Stock, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which
he shall be entitled. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to
the close of business on the date of surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted,
and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such
conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of
Common Stock on such date. If the conversion is in connection with an underwritten offering of
securities pursuant to the Securities Act, the conversion may, at the option of any holder
tendering shares of Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the
underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering, in which event the person(s)
entitled to receive the Common Stock upon conversion of the shares of Preferred Stock shall not
be deemed to have converted such shares of Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the
closing of such sale of securities. Notwithstanding that any certificate for shares of any series of
Preferred Stock to be converted in a mandatory conversion pursuant to Section C.4(b) shall not
have been surrendered as of the date fixed for conversion, each holder of shares of each series of
Preferred Stock shall thereafter be treated for all purposes as the record holder of the number of
shares of Common Stock issuable to such holder upon conversion.

(d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock. The Conversion Price
of each series of Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as set forth

Amendment to Articles. DOC
below.

(i) Special Definitions. For purposes of this Article IV, Section
C.4(d), the following definitions apply:

(1) “Additional Shares of Common Stock” shall mean all
shares of Common Stock issued (or, pursuant to Article IV, Section C.4(d)(iv), deemed to be
issued) by the Corporation after the Original Issue Date, other than shares of Common Stock
issued or issuable:

(A) upon conversion of shares of Series A Preferred
Stock;

(B) _ to officers, directors or employees of, or consultants
to, the Corporation pursuant to stock option or stock purchase plans or agreements or other stock
incentive plans or arrangements on terms approved by the Board of Directors, but not exceeding
an aggregate of 1,382,500 shares of Common Stock, subject to adjustment for all subdivisions
and combinations, which may be issued from time to time without the prior approval of the
holders of Series A Preferred Stock;

(C) asa dividend or distribution to all holders of Series
A Preferred Stock or as a dividend or distribution to all holders of Common Stock or Series A
Preferred Stock as authorized herein;

(D) upon conversion of warrants issued to banks or
other lenders or to equipment lessors in connection with a loan or equipment lease approved by
the Board of Directors;

(E) in connection with business combinations or
corporate partnering agreements approved by the Board of Directors including the three (3)
directors appointed by the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock; or

(F) for which adjustment of the Conversion Price for
each affected series of Preferred Stock is made pursuant to Article IV, Section C.4(e).

(2) “Convertible Securities” shall mean any evidences of
indebtedness, shares or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock.

(3) “Original Issue Date” shall mean with respect to each
series of Preferred Stock, the date on which shares of such series of Preferred Stock were first

issued;

(4) “Options” shall mean rights, options, or warrants to
subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire either Common Stock or Convertible Securities.

Amendment to Articles. DOC
(ii) | No Adjustment of Conversion Price. Any provision herein to the
contrary notwithstanding, no adjustment in the Conversion Price for any share of any series of
Preferred Stock shall be made in respect of the issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock
unless the consideration per share (determined pursuant to Article IV, Section C.4(d)(v) hereof)
for an Additional Share of Common Stock issued or deemed to be issued by the Corporation is
less than the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock in effect on the date of, and
immediately prior to, such issue.

(iii) Adjustment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional
Shares of Common Stock. In the event this Corporation, after the Original Issue Date shall issue
Additional Shares of Common Stock (including Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to
be issued pursuant to Article IV, Section C.4(d)(iv)) without consideration or for a consideration
per share less than the Conversion Price with respect to any series of Preferred Stock in effect
immediately prior to such issue, then and in such event, the Conversion Price for such series of
Preferred Stock shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the
nearest cent) determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of
which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such
issue plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration received by
the Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued would
purchase at such Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance, and the
denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to such issue plus the number of such Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued. For
the purpose of the above calculation, the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to such issue shall be calculated on a fully diluted basis, as if all shares of
Series A Preferred Stock and all Convertible Securities had been fully converted into shares of
Common Stock immediately prior to such issuance and any outstanding Options had been fully
exercised immediately prior to such issuance (and the resulting securities fully converted into
shares of Common Stock, if so convertible) as of such date.

(iv) Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock. In the
event the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall issue
any Options or Convertible Securities or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders
of any class of securities then entitled to receive any such Options or Convertible Securities, then
the maximum number of shares (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto without regard to
any provisions contained therein designed to protect against dilution) of Common Stock issuable
upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities and Options therefor,
the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities and Options, shall be deemed to be
Additional Shares of Common Stock issued as of the time of such issue or, in case such a record
date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, provided that in any
such case in which Additional Shares of Common Stock are deemed to be issued:

(1) no further adjustments in the Conversion Price of any series
of Preferred Stock shall be made upon the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities or shares
of Common Stock upon the exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities;

Amendment to Articles. DOC
(2) if such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms
provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any increase or decrease in the consideration
payable to the Corporation, or decrease or increase in the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable, upon the exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, the Conversion Price of each series
of Preferred Stock computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record
date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon any such
increase or decrease becoming effective, be recomputed to reflect such increase or decrease
insofar as it affects such Options or the rights of conversion or exchange under such Convertible
Securities (provided, however, that no such adjustment of the Conversion Price shall affect
Common Stock previously issued upon conversion of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock;

(3) upon the expiration of any such Options or any rights of
conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have been exercised,
the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock computed upon the original issue thereof
(or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments
based thereon, shall, upon such expiration, be recomputed as if:

(A) _ inthe case of Convertible Securities or Options for
Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common Stock issued were the shares of
Common Stock, if any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities and the consideration received therefor was the
consideration actually received by the Corporation for the issue of all such Options, whether or
not exercised, plus the consideration actually received by the Corporation upon such exercise, or
for the issue of all such Convertible Securities which were actually converted or exchanged, plus
the additional consideration, if any, actually received by the Corporation upon such conversion or
exchange; and

(B) in the case of Options for Convertible Securities,
only the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were issued at
the time of issue of such Options, and the consideration received by the Corporation for the
Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been then issued was the consideration
actually received by the Corporation for the issue of all such Options, whether or not exercised,
plus the consideration deemed to have been received by the Corporation (determined pursuant to
Article IV, Section C.4(d)(v)) upon the issue of the Convertible Securities with respect to which
such Options were actually exercised;

(4) no readjustment pursuant to clause (2) or (3) above shall
have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock to an amount
which exceeds the lower of (a) the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock on the
original adjustment date, or (b) the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock that
would have resulted from any issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock between the
original adjustment date and such readjustment date;

(5) in the case of any Options which expire by their terms not

Amendment to Articles. DOC
more than thirty (30) days after the date of issue thereof, no adjustment of the Conversion Price
of any series of Preferred Stock shall be made until the expiration or exercise of all such Options,
whereupon such adjustment shall be made in the same manner provided in clause (3) above; and

(6) if any such record date shall have been fixed and such
Options or Convertible Securities are not issued on the date fixed therefor, the adjustment
previously made in the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock which became
effective on such record date shall be cancelled as of the close of business on such record date
and shall instead be made on the actual date of issuance, if any.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this Article IV,
Section C.4(d), the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional
Shares of Common Stock shall be computed as follows:

(1) Cash and property. Such consideration shall:

(A) _ insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
ageregate amount of cash received by the Corporation excluding amounts paid or payable for
accrued interest or accrued dividends;

(B) _ insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors; and

(C) inthe event Additional Shares of Common Stock
are issued together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for
consideration which covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed
as provided in clauses (A) and (B) above, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(2) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per
share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been
issued pursuant to Article IV, Section C.4(d)(iv), relating to Options and Convertible Securities
shall be determined by dividing:

(A) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by
the Corporation as consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the
minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating
thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein designed to protect against dilution)
payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of
such Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of
such Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, by

(B) — the maximum number of shares of Common Stock

(as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein
designed to protect against the dilution) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or conversion

Amendment to Articles.DOC
or exchange of such Convertible Securities.

(e) Adjustments to Conversion Prices for Stock Dividends and for
Combinations or Subdivisions of Common Stock. In the event that the Corporation at any time
or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall declare or pay, without consideration, any
dividend on the Common Stock payable in Common Stock or in any right to acquire Common
Stock for no consideration, or shall effect a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common
Stock into a greater number of shares of Common Stock (by stock split, reclassification or
otherwise than by payment of a dividend in Common Stock or in any right to acquire Common
Stock), or in the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined or
consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock,
then the Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such
event shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such event, be proportionately decreased or
increased, as appropriate. In the event that this Corporation shall declare or pay, without
consideration, any dividend on the Common Stock payable in any right to acquire Common
Stock for no consideration, then the Corporation shall be deemed to have made a dividend
payable in Common Stock in an amount of shares equal to the maximum number of shares
issuable upon exercise of such rights to acquire Common Stock.

(f) Adjustments for Reclassification and Reorganization. If the Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or

a different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock, whether by capital
reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares
provided for in Article IV, Section C.4(e) above or a merger or other reorganization treated as a
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation under Article IV, Section C.2(c)
above), the Conversion Price of the Series A Preferred Stock then in effect shall, concurrently
with the effectiveness of such reorganization or reclassification, be proportionately adjusted so
that shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be convertible into, in lieu of the number of shares
of Common Stock, or other securities or property, which the holders would otherwise have been
entitled to receive, a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock equivalent to the
number of shares of Common Stock that would have been subject to receipt by the holders upon
conversion of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock immediately before that change.

(g) No Impairment. The Corporation will not, by amendment of its Articles of
Incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger,
dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the
observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the
Corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of
this Article IV, Section C.4 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or
appropriate in order to protect the Conversion Rights of the holders of shares of each series of
Preferred Stock against impairment.

(h) Certificates as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Article IV,
Section C.4, the Corporation at its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or

Amendment to Articles. DOC
readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and prepare and furnish to each holder of such
series of Preferred Stock a certificate executed by the Corporation's President or Chief Executive
Officer setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which
such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon the written request at any
time of any holder of shares of any series of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to
such holder a like certificate setting forth (1) such adjustments and readjustments, (ii) the
Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock at the time in effect, and (iii) the number of
shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be
received upon the conversion of shares of such series of Preferred Stock.

(1) Notices of Record Date. In the event that the Corporation shall propose at
any time: (1) to declare any dividend or distribution upon its Common Stock (other than by
purchase of shares of Common Stock of employees, officers or directors of, or consultants to, the
Corporation pursuant to the termination of such person’s status as such or pursuant to the
Corporation’s exercise of rights of first refusal with respect to its shares), whether in cash,
property, stock or other securities, whether or not a regular cash dividend and whether or not out
of earnings or earned surplus; (ii) to offer for subscription pro rata to the holders of any class or
series of its stock any additional shares of stock of any class or series or other rights; (iii) to effect
any re-classification or recapitalization of its Common Stock outstanding involving a change in
the Common Stock; or (iv) to merge, consolidate or effect a share exchange or other combination
with or into any other corporation, or sell, lease or convey all or substantially all of its assets, or
to liquidate, dissolve or wind up; then, in connection with each such event, the Corporation shall
send to the holders of shares of each series of Preferred Stock:

(1) at least twenty (20) days' prior written notice of the date on
which a record shall be taken for such dividend, distribution or subscription rights (and
specifying the date on which the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled thereto) or for
determining rights to vote, if any, in respect of the matters referred to in (iii) and (iv) above; and

(2) in the case of the matters referred to in (iii) and (iv) above,
at least twenty (20) days' prior written notice of the date when the same shall take place (and
specifying the date on which the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to exchange their
Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon the occurrence of such event).

(j) Issue Taxes. The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and other taxes
that may be payable in respect of any issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock on mandatory
conversion of shares of any series of Preferred Stock pursuant hereto; provided, however, that the
Corporation shall not be obligated to pay any transfer taxes resulting from any transfer requested
by any holder in connection with any such conversion.

(k) Reservation of Common Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The
Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares
of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of each series
of Preferred Stock, such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be
sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of each series of Preferred Stock; and

Amendment to Articles. DOC
if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be
sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of such series of Preferred Stock,
the Corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary
to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as

shall be sufficient for such purpose, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to
obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to this Certificate of
Incorporation.

(1) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued
upon the conversion of any share or shares of any series of Preferred Stock. All shares of
Common Stock (including fractions thereof) issuable upon conversion of more than one share of
any series of Preferred Stock by a holder thereof shall be aggregated for purposes of determining
whether the conversion would result in the issuance of any fractional share. If, after the
aforementioned aggregation, the conversion would result in the issuance of a fraction of a share
of Common Stock, the Corporation shall, in lieu of issuing any fractional share, pay the holder
otherwise entitled to such fraction a sum in cash equal to the fair market value of such fraction on
the date of conversion (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors).

(m) Multiple Issuance Dates. Notwithstanding anything in this Article IV,
Section C.4 to the contrary, in the event the Corporation issues shares of the same series of
Preferred Stock on more than one date, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted only once for the
issuance of shares of such series of Preferred Stock, such adjustment to occur upon the earlier of
(i) one hundred twenty (120) days after the first issuance thereof, (ii) upon the final closing of the
issuance thereof or (iii) immediately prior to any conversion or repurchase of such Preferred
Stock.

(n) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Article IV, Section
C.4 to be given to the holders of shares of any series of Preferred Stock shall be deemed given if
deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, or if sent by facsimile or delivered
personally by hand or nationally recognized courier and addressed to each holder of record at
such holder's address or facsimile number appearing in the records of the Corporation.

5. Redemption.

(a) Commencing on or after the fifth (Sth) anniversary of the issuance of the
Series A Preferred Stock, upon the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than two-thirds
(2/3) of the then-outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall redeem,
from any source of funds legally available therefor, the Series A Preferred Stock in three (3)
equal annual installments of one-third (1/3) of the remaining outstanding shares of the Series A
Preferred Stock commencing on the date which is one year from the notice of redemption (each a
‘Redemption Date”). The Corporation shall effect such redemptions on the applicable
Redemption Dates by paying in cash in exchange for the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock to
be redeemed a sum equal to the greater of (1) the Original Issue Price plus all accrued or declared
but unpaid dividends on such shares or (ii) the fair market value of the shares of the Series A
Preferred Stock as of the applicable Redemption Date as determined below (the “Redemption

Amendment to Articles. DOC
Price’).

The fair market value shall be determined by the Board of Directors in good faith
including the Director appointed by the holders of the Common Stock and a majority of the
Directors appointed by the holders of the Preferred Stock; provided, however, that if the Director
appointed by the holders of the Common Stock and the Directors appointed by the holders of the
Preferred Stock are unable to agree as to the fair market value of the shares of Series A Preferred
Stock, then the fair market value shall be determined by an appraiser appointed by the
disinterested members of the Board of Directors.

Any redemption effected pursuant to this Article IV, Section C.5(a) shall be made on a
pro-rata basis among the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock in proportion to the shares of the
Series A Preferred Stock then held by them.

(b) At least fifteen (15) but no more than thirty (30) days prior to each
Redemption Date written notice shall be mailed, first class postage prepaid, to each holder of
record (at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is
given) of shares of each series of Preferred Stock to be redeemed, at the address last shown on
the records of the Corporation for such holder, notifying such holder of the redemption to be
effected, specifying the number of shares to be redeemed from such holder, the Redemption
Date, the Redemption Price, the place at which payment may be obtained and calling upon such
holder to surrender to the Corporation, in the manner and at the place designated, his certificate
or certificates representing the shares to be redeemed (the “Redemption Notice”). Except as
provided in Article IV, Section C.5(c), on or after the Redemption Date, each holder of shares of
each series of Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall surrender to the Corporation the certificate or
certificates representing such shares, in the manner and at the place designated in the Redemption
Notice, and thereupon the Redemption Price of such shares shall be payable to the order of the
person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof and each
surrendered certificate shall be canceled. In the event less than all the shares represented by any
such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed
shares.

(c) From and after the payment of the Redemption Price, all rights of the
holder of shares of any series of Preferred Stock designated for redemption in the Redemption
Notice as holder of share of Preferred Stock shall cease with respect to such shares, and such
shares shall not thereafter be transferred on the books of the Corporation or be deemed to be
outstanding for any purpose whatsoever. If the funds of the Corporation legally available for
redemption of shares of each series of Preferred Stock on any Redemption Date are insufficient
to redeem the total number of shares of each series of Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such
date, those funds which are legally available will be used to redeem the maximum possible
number of such shares ratably among the holders of such shares to be redeemed based upon their
holdings of shares of each series of Preferred Stock. The shares of any series of Preferred Stock
not redeemed shall remain outstanding and entitled to all the rights and preferences provided
herein. At any time thereafter when additional funds of the Corporation are legally available for
the redemption of shares of each series of Preferred Stock such funds will immediately be used to

redeem the balance of the shares which the Corporation has become obliged to redeem on any
Redemption Date, but which it has not redeemed.

6. No Reissuance of Preferred Stock. No share or shares of any series of
Preferred Stock acquired by the Corporation by reason of redemption, purchase, conversion or
otherwise shall be reissued, and all such shares of such series shall be canceled and retired and
returned to shares of undesignated Preferred Stock which the Corporation shall be authorized to
issue subject to the terms herein.
