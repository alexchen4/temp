B. SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK AND SERIES B PREFERRED STOCK
l. Dividends.

(a) The holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock, in preference to the
holders of all Series A Preferred Stock and of all Junior Securities, shall be entitled to receive,
when and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the purpose,
cumulative but non-compounding dividends as provided herein. Dividends on each share of
Series B Preferred Stock shall accrue at the per annum rate of 5% of the Series B Purchase Price
and shall be payable in accordance with Section B.1(f) below. Series B Preferred Dividends
shall commence to accrue daily on each issued and outstanding share of Series B Preferred Stock
from the date of issuance thereof and continue to accrue thereafter (whether or not such
dividends are declared by the Board of Directors and whether or not there are profits, surplus or
other funds of the Corporation legally available for the payment of dividends) until the first to
occur of (x) the date on which the Series B Liquidation Preference with respect to such share is
paid in full in cash, (y) such share is redeemed and the redemption price thereof is paid in
accordance herewith, and (z) such share is converted into Common Stock in accordance
herewith. Except as otherwise provided herein, if at any time the Corporation pays less than the
total amount of accrued but unpaid dividends with respect to the issued and outstanding shares of
Series B Preferred Stock, such payment shall be distributed ratably among the holders of issued
and outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock based upon the number of such shares at the
time held by each such holder.

(b) Subject to the priority and senior rights of the holders of shares of the
Series B Preferred Stock, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, in preference to the
holders of all Junior Securities, shall be entitled to receive, when and if declared by the Board of
Directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, cumulative but non-compounding
dividends as provided herein. Dividends on each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall accrue
at the per annum rate of 5% of the Series A Purchase Price and shall be payable in accordance
with Section B.1(f) below. Series A Preferred Dividends shall commence to accrue daily on
each issued and outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock the date of issuance thereof and
continue to accrue thereafter (whether or not such dividends are declared by the Board of
Directors and whether or not there are profits, surplus or other funds of the Corporation legally
available for the payment of dividends) until the first to occur of (x) the date on which the Series
A Liquidation Preference with respect to such share is paid in full in cash, (y) such share is
redeemed and the redemption price thereof is paid in accordance herewith, and (z) such share is
converted into Common Stock in accordance herewith. Except as otherwise provided herein, if
at any time the Corporation pays less than the total amount of accrued but unpaid dividends with
respect to the issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, such payment shall be
distributed ratably among the holders of issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred
Stock based upon the number of such shares at the time held by each such holder.

{c) In the event that the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall
declare a dividend payable upon the then outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than a
stock dividend on the Common Stock payable solely in the form of additional shares of Common
Stock), the holders of the Series Preferred Stock shall be entitled, in addition to any cumulative
dividends to which such holders may be entitled under clauses (a) and (b) above, to receive the

-4-
COLUMBUS/566572.5
amount of dividends (the “Participating Dividend”) per share of Series B Preferred Stock or
Series A Preferred Stock, as applicable, that would be payable on the number of whole shares of
Common Stock into which each share of Series B Preferred Stock or Series A Preferred Stock
held by each holder could be converted pursuant the provisions of Section B.3 hereof, such
number determined as of the record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock
entitled to receive such dividend.

(d) Without the consent of the Requisite Series Preferred Stockholders, so
long as any shares of Series Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Corporation shall not and shail
not permit any Subsidiary to declare, pay or set apart for payment any dividends or make any
other distribution on or redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire for valuc, or set apart for any
sinking or other analogous fund for the redemption or purchase of any Junior Securities (other
than stock dividends and distributions in the nature of a stock split, reverse stock split or the like
for which adjustment to the Conversion Price is made pursuant to Section B.4); provided,
however, that the Corporation may purchase, redeem or acquire shares of Common Stock and/or
Convertible Securities issued to officers, directors and/or employees of, and/or consultants to, the
Corporation or any Subsidiary pursuant to equity incentive plans upon termination of
employment or service or in accordance with other arrangements that (i) are in existence as of
the Effective Time, or (ii) are approved by the Board of Directors (with the approval of the
Series Preferred Director Designees then serving on the Board of Directors at that time, if any).

(e) All numbers relating to the calculation of dividends pursuant to this
Section B.1 shall be equitably adjusted to reflect any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend, combination, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other
similar event involving Series B Preferred Stock, Series A Preferred Stock or Common Stock.

(f) Accrued and unpaid Series B Preferred Dividends and Series A
Preferred Dividends shall be payable, at the election of the Company, in either cash or shares of
Series B Preferred Stock or Series A Preferred Stock, as the case may be, subject to available and
authorized shares of Series B Preferred Stock or Series A Preferred Stock, as the case may be.
Accrued and unpaid Participating Dividends shall be payable, at the election of the Company, in
either cash or shares of Common Stock, subject to available and authorized shares of Common
Stock. Accrued and unpaid Series B Preferred Dividends, Series A Preferred Dividends and/or
Participating Dividends converted into shares of Common Stock shall be converted at the
applicable Conversion Price.

2. Liquidation Preference.

(a) Upon (i) any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation,
whether voluntary or involuntary, or (ii) a Sale of the Corporation (each of the events referred to
in clauses (i) and (ii) being referred to as a “Liquidation Event”), each holder of Series B
Preferred Stock shall be entitled, after provision for the payment of the Corporation’s debts and
other liabilities and in preference to, and, before any amount or property shall be paid or
distributed on account of any Series A Preferred Stock or Junior Securities, to be paid in full with
respect to each share of Series B Preferred Stock out of the assets of the Corporation available
for distribution to stockholders, an amount equal to the Series B Liquidation Preference. If upon
any Liquidation Event the amount available for distribution among the holders of all outstanding

-5-
COLUMBUS/566572.5
Series B Preferred Stock is insufficient to permit the payment of the Series B Liquidation
Preference of each share of Series B Preferred Stock in full, then the amount available for
distribution shall be distributed among the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock ratably in
proportion to the number of shares of the Series B Preferred Stock held by such holders, and the
holders of Series A Preferred Stock, of Common Stock and of any other Junior Securities shall in
no event be entitled to participate in the distribution of any assets of the Corporation in respect of
their ownership thereof.

(b) Upon a Liquidation Event, each holder of Series A Preferred Stock
shall be entitled, after provision for the payment of the Corporation’s debts and other liabilities
and the payment of the Series B Liquidation Preference and in preference to, and, before any
amount or property shall be paid or distributed on account of any Junior Securities, to be paid in
full with respect to each share of Series A Preferred Stock out of the assets of the Corporation
available for distribution to stockholders, an amount equal to the Series A Liquidation
Preference. If upon any Liquidation Event the amount available for distribution among the
holders of all outstanding Series A Preferred Stock is insufficient to permit the payment of the
Series A Liquidation Preference of each share of Series A Preferred Stock in full, then the
amount available for distribution shall be distributed among the holders of the Series A Preferred
Stock ratably in proportion to the number of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock held by such
holders, and the holders of Common Stock and of any other Junior Securities shall in no event be
entitled to participate in the distribution of any assets of the Corporation in respect of their
ownership thereof. Upon any Liquidation Event, after the holders of Series A Preferred Stock
shall have been paid in full the preferential amounts to which they shall be entitled to receive on
account of their Series A Preferred Stock as provided above in this Section B.2(b), the remaining
net assets of the Corporation shall be distributed ratably among the holders of Series A Preferred
Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Common Stock as described in Section B.2(c).

(c) Upon any Liquidation Event, after (i) the holders of Series B Preferred
Stock shall have been paid in full the preferential amounts to which they shall be entitled to
receive on account of their Series B Preferred Stock as provided above in Section B.2(a) and
(ii) the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall have been paid in full the preferential amounts
to which they shall be entitled to receive on account of their Series A Preferred Stock as
provided above in Section B.2(b), the remaining net assets of the Corporation shall be distributed
ratably among the holders of Series B Preferred Stock, Series A Preferred Stock and Common
Stock (with each share of Series B Preferred Stock and Series A Preferred Stock being deemed
for such purpose to equal the number of shares of Common Stock, including fractions thereof,
into which such share of Series B Preferred Stock or Series A Preferred Stock, as the case may
be, is convertible in accordance with Section B.3 hereof); provided, however, that the maximum
amount payable to each holder of Series B Preferred Stock (including amounts payable pursuant
to Section B.2(a) above) shall be four times (4x) the Series B Purchase Price.

a (d) Consolidation, Merger, etc. A Sale of the Corporation shall be deemed
to be a Liquidation Event for the purposes of this Section B.2 unless the Requisite Series

Preferred Stockholders waive in writing the provisions of this Section B.2 with respect to such
event.

COLUMBUS/566572.5
(e) No Effect on Conversion Rights. The provisions of this Section B.2
shall not in any way limit the right of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B
Preferred Stock to elect to convert their shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred
Stock, as the case may be, into shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section B.3 hereof
prior to or in connection with any Liquidation Event, and in lieu of receiving any amount with
respect to the Series A Liquidation Preference related to such Series A Preferred Stock, or the
Series B Liquidation Preference related to such Series B Preferred Stock upon such conversion
into Common Stock, such holder shall (as to such converted shares) participate in the
Liquidation Event as a holder of Common Stock.

(f) Valuation of Distribution Securities. Any securities or other
consideration to be delivered to the holders of Series Preferred Stock upon any Liquidation Event
in accordance with the terms hereof shall be valued as follows:

(1) If the consideration consists of cash or cash equivalents,
then the value shall be computed at the aggregate amount of the cash or cash equivalents so
delivered;

(ii) | The per share value of securities traded on a national
securities exchange or a nationally recognized interdealer quotation system shall be deemed to be
the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange or system over the 20-day
period ending three (3) Business Days prior to the closing of such Liquidation Event,

(iii) The per share value of securities traded over-the-counter
shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid and asked prices over the 30-day period
ending three (3) Business Days prior to the closing of such Liquidation Event; and

(iv) For all other consideration, the value shall be the fair
market value thereof as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(v) In the event that the Requisite Series Preferred
Stockholders dispute any valuation determined by the Board of Directors pursuant to
Section B.2(f)(iv), such holders shall have the right to obtain an independent valuation of such
property, security or other non-cash consideration from one nationally recognized investment
bank, not affiliated with any holder of Series Preferred Stock, reasonably acceptable to the
Corporation, and with substantial experience in making such valuations. If the valuation
determined by such bank is within 15% (higher or lower) of the valuation determined by the
Board of Directors, the holders of Series Preferred Stock requesting such valuation shall pay for
the fees and expenses of such bank in making such valuation, otherwise the Corporation shall
pay such fees and expenses.

3. Conversion into Common Stock. The holders of Series Preferred Stock
shall have the following conversion rights:

(a) Voluntary Conversion. At any time, a holder of Series Preferred Stock
shall be entitled, without the payment of any additional consideration, to cause all or any portion
of the shares of Series Preferred Stock held by such holder to be converted into a number of
shares of Common Stock determined as hereafter provided in this Section B.3(a), which shares

_7-
COLUMBUS/566572.5
shall upon the issuance thereof be fully paid and non-assessable. The number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of each share of Series B Preferred Stock shall be
equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the sum of the Series B Purchase Price plus the
Series B Preferred Dividends, by (ii) the Series B Conversion Price, in each case as in effect at
the time of conversion. The number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of
each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the
sum of the Series A Purchase Price plus the Series A Preferred Dividends, by (ii) the Series A
Conversion Price, in each case as in effect at the time of conversion. The number of shares of
Common Stock into which shares of Series Preferred Stock are convertible and the Series A
Conversion Price and Series B Conversion Price are subject to adjustment from time to time as
hereafter provided.

(b) Automatic Conversion.

(i) Each share of Series Preferred Stock shall automatically be
converted, without the payment of any additional consideration, into the number of shares of
Common Stock provided for in Section B.3(a) immediately prior to the consummation of the
Corporation’s first underwritten Public Offering of Common Stock pursuant to an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act (A) resulting in at least $75,000,000 of proceeds
to the Corporation, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses,
(B) reflecting a gross offering price per share of Common Stock (as equitably adjusted to reflect
any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, combination, consolidation, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification or other similar event involving Common Stock) of not less than
$10.00 per share, and (C) after giving effect to which the Corporation’s Common Stock is listed
ona U.S. national securities exchange (a “Qualified Public Offering”).

(ii) Each share of Series B Preferred Stock shall automatically
be converted, without the payment of any additional consideration, into the number of shares of
Common Stock provided for in Section B.3(a) upon the written request of the Requisite Series B
Stockholders to automatically convert (a “Majority B Conversion”).

(ili) | Each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall automatically
be converted, without the payment of any additional consideration, into the number of shares of
Common Stock provided for in Section B.3(a) upon the written request of the Requisite Series A
Stockholders to automatically convert (a “Majority A Conversion” and, together with a
Majority B Conversion, a “Majority Conversion”).

(c) Procedure for Voluntary Conversion: Effective Date. Upon the
election to convert the Series Preferred Stock made in accordance with Section B.3(a), the

holders of the Series Preferred Stock making such election shall provide written notice of such
conversion (the “Voluntary Conversion Notice’’) to the Corporation setting forth the number of
shares of Series Preferred Stock each such holder elects to convert into Common Stock (the
“Elected Preferred Stock”). On the date the Voluntary Conversion Notice is delivered to the
Corporation, such shares of Elected Preferred Stock shall thereupon be converted, without
further action, into the number of shares of Common Stock provided for in Section B.3(a), and
such number of shares of Common Stock into which the Elected Preferred Stock is converted
shall thereupon be deemed to have been issued to such holders of the Elected Preferred Stock.

-8-
COLUMBUS/566572.5
Such holders shall as soon as practicable thereafter surrender to the Corporation at the
Corporation’s principal executive office the certificate or certificates evidencing the Elected
Preferred Stock, duly assigned or endorsed for transfer to the Corporation (or accompanied by
duly executed stock powers relating thereto), or an Affidavit of Loss with respect thereto. Upon
surrender of such certificates or delivery of an Affidavit of Loss with respect thereto, the
Corporation shall issue and deliver to the holder so surrendering such certificates or to such
holder’s designee, at an address designated by such holder, certificates for the number of shares
of Common Stock into which such holder’s Elected Preferred Stock shall have been converted.
The issuance of certificates for shares of Common Stock upon conversion of Elected Preferred
Stock will be made without charge to the holders of such shares for any issuance tax in respect
thereof or other costs incurred by the Corporation in connection with such conversion and the
related issuance of such stock. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Section B.3(c), in the event that the holders of shares of Series Preferred Stock elect to convert
such shares pursuant to Section B.3(a) in connection with any Liquidation Event, Public Offering
or other specified event, (i) such conversion may at the election of such holders be conditioned
upon the consummation of such Liquidation Event, Public Offering or the occurrence of such
other specified event, in which case, such conversion shall not be deemed to be effective until the
consummation of such Liquidation Event, Public Offering or the occurrence of such other
specified event and (ii) if such Liquidation Event, Public Offering or other specified event is
consummated or occurs, all shares of Elected Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have been
converted into shares of Common Stock immediately prior thereto.

(d) Procedure for Automatic Conversion. As of the date of, and in all
cases subject to, the consummation of a Qualified Public Offering or a Majority Conversion, all
outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, as the case may be,
shall be converted automatically, without further action, into the number of shares of Common
Stock provided for in Section B.3(a), and such number of shares of Common Stock into which
the Series Preferred Stock is converted shall be deemed to have been issued to the holders of
Series Preferred Stock. Such holders shall as soon as practicable thereafter surrender the
certificate or certificates evidencing the Series Preferred Stock, duly assigned or endorsed for
transfer to the Corporation (or accompanied by duly executed stock powers relating thereto) or
an Affidavit of Loss with respect thereto. Upon surrender of such certificates or delivery of an
Affidavit of Loss with respect thereto, the Corporation shall issue and deliver to such holder so
surrendering such certificates or to such holder's designee, promptly (and in any event in such
time as is sufficient to enable such holder to participate in such Qualified Public Offering or
applicable Majority Conversion, subject to and in accordance with the Registration Rights
Agreement) at an address designated by such holder, certificates for the number of shares of
Common Stock into which such holder’s Series Preferred Stock shall have been converted.

(e) Fractional Shares; Partial Conversion. No fractional shares shall be
issued upon conversion of any shares of Series Preferred Stock. All shares of Common Stock
(including fractions thereof) issuable upon conversion of Series Preferred Stock by a holder
thereof shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the conversion would result in
the issuance of any fractional share. If any fractional interest in a share of Common Stock
would, except for the provisions of the first sentence of this paragraph (e), be delivered upon any
such conversion, the Corporation, in lieu of delivering the fractional share thereof, shall pay to
the holder surrendering the Series Preferred Stock for conversion an amount in cash equal to the

-9-
COLUMBUS/566572.5
current fair market value of such fractional interest as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors. In case the number of shares of Series Preferred Stock represented by the certificate
or certificates surrendered for conversion exceeds the number of shares converted, the
Corporation shall, upon such conversion, execute and deliver to the holder thereof, at the
expense of the Corporation, a new certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Series
Preferred Stock represented by the certificate or certificates surrendered that are not to be
converted.

4. Adjustments.

(a) Adjustments for Subdivisions, Combinations or Consolidation of
Common Stock. In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided by
stock split, stock dividends or otherwise, into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the
Conversion Price then in effect with respect to Series Preferred Stock shall, concurrently with the
effectiveness of such subdivision, be proportionately decreased so that the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable on conversion of any shares of Series Preferred Stock shall be increased
in proportion to such increase in outstanding shares. In the event the outstanding shares of
Common Stock shall be combined or consolidated, by reclassification, reverse stock split, or
otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, the Series B Conversion Price then
in effect with respect to Series B Preferred Stock and Series A Conversion Price then in effect
with respect to Series A Preferred Stock shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such
combination or consolidation, be proportionately increased so that the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable on conversion of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B
Preferred Stock shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares.

(b) Adjustments for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. If the
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series Preferred Stock shall be changed into the

same or a different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock or into any other
securities or property, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification, merger, combination of
shares, recapitalization, consolidation, business combination or other similar transaction (other
than a subdivision, consolidation or combination of shares provided for above and other than a
Liquidation Event which shall be governed by Section B.2), each share of Series Preferred Stock
shall thereafter be convertible into the number of shares of stock or other securities or property to
which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation deliverable upon
conversion of such share of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, as the case
may be, shall have been entitled upon such capital reorganization, reclassification, merger,
combination of shares, recapitalization, consolidation, business combination or other similar
transaction if immediately prior to such capital reorganization, reclassification, merger,
combination of shares, recapitalization, consolidation, business combination or other similar
transaction such holder had converted such holder’s Series Preferred Stock into Common Stock.
The provisions of this Section B.4(b) shall similarly apply to outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred Stock and outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock at the time of any successive
capital reorganizations, reclassifications, mergers, combinations of shares, recapitalizations,
consolidations, business combinations or other similar transactions. The Corporation shall not
effect any Sale of the Corporation that is not, in accordance with Section B.2(b), a Liquidation
Event unless prior to or simultaneously with the consummation thereof the successor corporation
or purchaser, as the casc may be, shall assume by written instrument the obligation to deliver to

-10-
COLUMBUS/566572.5
the holders of Series Preferred Stock such shares of stock, securities or assets as, in accordance
with the foregoing provisions, each such holder is entitled to receive.

(c) Adjustment of the Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional
Shares of Common Stock. In the event the Corporation shall on or at any time following the

Effective Time issue or sell, or in accordance with Section B.4(e) is deemed to have issued or
sold, any shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities without consideration or for a
consideration per share of Common Stock less than the applicable Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such issue or sale, then and in such event, such Conversion Price shall be
reduced, concurrently with such issue or sale, to a price (calculated to the nearest whole cent)
determined by the following formula:

P=P1QOi1 + P202
Qi +Q2

Where:
P = the applicable Conversion Price in effect immediately
following such issue or sale

Pl = _ the applicable Conversion Price in effect immediately
prior to such issue or sale

Q! = _ the number of shares of Common Stock Deemed
Outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale

P2 = the consideration per share, if any, received or
receivable by the Corporation on account of such issue
or sale

Q2 =_ the number of shares of Common Stock so issued or

sold or, in accordance with Section B.4(e), deemed to
have been issued or sold

(d) Multiple Closing Dates. In the event the Corporation shall issue on
more than one date additional shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities, and such
issuance dates occur within a period of no more than 120 days, then, upon the final such issuance
(or at the time of any conversion, if earlier), the applicable Conversion Price shall be readjusted
to give effect to all such issuances as if they occurred on the date of the final such issuance (and
without giving effect to any adjustments as a result of such prior issuances within such period).

(e) Effect_of Certain Events on Conversion Prices. For purposes of
determining the adjusted Conversion Price with respect to Series A Preferred Stock and Series B
Preferred Stock under Section B.4(c), the following shall be applicable:

-ll-
COLUMBUS/566572.5
(i) Issuance of Convertible Securities.

(A)If the Corporation in any manner grants, issues or sells
any Convertible Securities, whether or not the rights to exercise, convert or exchange any such
Convertible Securities are immediately exercisable, and the price per share for which Common
Stock is issuable upon such exercise, conversion or exchange is less than the Conversion Price in
effect immediately prior to the time of such grant, issue or sale, then the maximum number of
shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the Corporation
at the time of the grant, issue or sale of such Convertible Securities for such price per share.

(B) For the purposes of this paragraph, the “price per share
for which Common Stock is issuable” shall be determined by dividing (x) the total amount
received or receivable by the Corporation as consideration for the grant, issue or sale of such
Convertible Securities, plus the cumulative minimum aggregate amount of additional
consideration, if any, payable to the Corporation upon the exercise, conversion or exchange
thereof and, if applicable, the exercise, conversion and exchange of any other Convertible
Securities that such Convertible Securities may be converted into or exercised or exchanged for
(in each case, as set forth in the instruments and agreements relating thereto, without regard to
any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration), by (y) the
total maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or
exchange of all such Convertible Securities (as set forth in the instruments and agreements
relating thercto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of
such number). No further adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made when Common
Stock and, if applicable, any other Convertible Securities, are actually issued upon the exercise,
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities.

(C) If the Corporation issues any Convertible Securities that
entitle the holder thereof, inter alia, both (i) to exercise, convert or exchange the same into or for
Common Stock or otherwise to participate with the holders of Common Stock in distributions
upon the occurrence of a Liquidation Event and (ii) in connection with or following such
exercise, conversion or exchange, to receive payment of a fixed or defined sum (such securities
being referred to herein as “Qualified Convertible Securities” and such sum being referred to as
the “Preference Payment”), the “total maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable
upon the exercise. conversion or exchange of all such Convertible Securities” for purposes of
clause (y) of Section B.4(e)(i)(B) above shall include, in addition to the amount described in
clause (y) of Section B.4(e)(i)(B) above, a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the
quotient of (A) the aggregate Preference Payments of all such Qualified Convertible Securities
so issued in excess of the total amount received or receivable by the Corporation as consideration
for the issue of all such Qualified Convertible Securities, divided by (B) the total amount
received or receivable by the Corporation as consideration for the issue of one of such Qualified
Convertible Secunties (as set forth in the instruments and agreements relating thereto).

(i) Change in Exercise Price or Conversion Rate. If the
additional consideration payable to the Corporation upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of
any Convertible Securities, or the rate at which any Convertible Securities are convertible into or
exchangeable for Common Stock should change at any time, the Conversion Price that is in

-12-

“=

COLUMBUS/566572.5
effect at the time of such change that was adjusted in accordance with Section B.4(e)(i) upon the
issuance of such Convertible Securities shall be readjusted to the Conversion Price that would
have been in effect at such time had such Convertible Securities that are still outstanding
provided for such changed additional consideration or changed conversion rate, as the case may
be, at the time such Convertible Securities were initially granted, issued or sold; and on the
termination date of any right to exercise, convert or exchange such Convertible Securities
without such right having been exercised, the Conversion Price then in effect hereunder shall be
adjusted to the Conversion Price that would have been in effect at the time of such termination
had such Convertible Securities, to the extent outstanding immediately prior to such termination,
never been issued.

(iii) Exceptions for Excluded Securities. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no adjustments shall be made under Sections B.4(c), (d) and/or (e) with respect to the
issue, grant or sale of any Excluded Secuntties.

(iv) Valuation of Non-Cash Consideration. The consideration
received by the Corporation for the issue of any shares of Common Stock, Convertible Securities
or any other Convertible Securities that such Convertible Securities may be converted into or
exercised or exchanged for shall be computed in accordance with Section B.2(d).

(f) Other Dilutive Issuances. If an event not specified in this Section B.4
(other than the issuance of Excluded Securities) occurs that has substantially the same economic
effect on the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock as those events specifically
enumerated above in this Section B.4, then this Section B.4 shall be construed liberally, mutatis
mutandis, in order to provide the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred
Stock the intended benefit of the protections provided under this Section B.4. In such event, the
Corporation’s Board of Directors shall make an appropriate adjustment in the Conversion Price
so as to protect the rights of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and the rights of the holders
of Series B Preferred Stock; provided that no such adjustment (other than in accordance with an
event in the nature of a combination or consolidation of the Common Stock) shall increase the
Series A Conversion Price above the Series A Purchase Price or increase the Series B
Conversion Price above the Series B Purchase Price as otherwise determined pursuant to this
Section B.4 or decrease the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of

each share of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock as otherwise determined in
accordance with this Section B.4.

(g) No Impairment. The Corporation will not, by amendment of its
certificate of incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation,
merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to
avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder
by the Corporation, and will at all times in good faith assist in the Calrying out of all the
provisions of this Section B.4 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or
appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock

and Series B Preferred Stock hereunder against impairment by the Corporation or any successor
entities.

-13-
COLUMBUS/S66572.5
(h) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment
or readjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section B.4, the Corporation at its
expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms
hereof and furnish to each holder of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock a
certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon
which such adjustment or readjustment is based and the applicable Conversion Price then in
effect. The Corporation shall, upon the written request at any time by any holder of Series A
Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like
certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and readjustments, (ii) the applicable Conversion
Price at the time in effect, and (iii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if
any, of other property that at the time would be received upon the conversion of such holder’s
Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock.

(i) Rounding. All calculations under this Section B.4 shall be made to
(i) the nearest one cent or (ii) the nearest share, as the case may be. All calculations of
percentages, if any, shall be carried to three decimal points but shall not be rounded up or down.

G) Series A Participation _in Issuance_of Series B Preferred Stock.
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Certificate of Incorporation to the contrary:

(i) If (x) the Corporation shall issuc or sell, or is, in accordance
with Section B.4(e), deemed to have issued or sold, any shares Series B Preferred Stock without
consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Series A Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such issuance (such issuance being referred to herein as a “Dilutive
Issuance”) and (y) a holder of Series A Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred Holder”) does not
purchase at least the lesser of (i) 50% of such Series A Preferred Holder’s Pro-Rata Portion of
the Series B Preferred Stock issued in such Dilutive Issuance and (ii) $100,000 of the Series B
Preferred Stock issued in such Dilutive Issuance (such holder being referred to herein as a “Non-
Participating Holder’), then the Conversion Portion (as defined below) of such Non-
Participating Holder’s shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall immediately and automatically
without further action on the part of such Non-Participating Holder be converted effective upon,
subject to, and concurrently with, the consummation of the Dilutive Issuance into shares of
Common Stock at the Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such Dilutive
Issuance or, with respect to any Dilutive Issuance permitted to include more than one closing, at
the Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the first closing occurring with
respect to such Dilutive Issuance. The "Conversion Portion" is defined as the number of shares
as determined by the following formula:

CP = Al(1-(A2/PS))

Where:
CP = _ Conversion Portion
Al = _ the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock held

-14-
COLUMBUS/566572.5
by the Non-Participating Holder

A2 = _ two times (2x) the number of shares for which such
Non-Participating Holder subscribes in the Dilutive
Issuance

PS = the number of shares equal to such Non-Participating

Holder’s Pro-Rata Portion of the shares of Senes B
Preferred Stock issued in such Dilutive Issuance

(ii) | Following the closing of a Dilutive Issuance, each Non-
Participating Holder shall promptly deliver to the Company or any transfer agent of the
Company for the Series Preferred Stock, the certificate(s) for shares of Series A Preferred Stock
representing the Conversion Portion, duly endorsed or assigned in blank to the Company. As
promptly as practicable thereafter, the Company shall issue and deliver to such holder a
certificate(s) for (x) the number of shares of Common Stock representing the Conversion Portion
of the Series A Preferred Stock and (y) the balance of the Non-Participating Holder’s shares of
Series A Preferred Stock. Regardless of when a Non-Participating Holder delivers his, her or its
certificates to the Company, such Non-Participating Holder shall be deemed to have ceased to be
a stockholder of record of the Conversion Portion of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock
previously held by him, her or it that are so converted, and to have become a stockholder of
record of the Common Stock issuable to him, her or it in connection therewith, as of the closing
of the Dilutive Issuance.

(iii) In determining whether a Series A Preferred Holder has
purchased its Pro-Rata Portion of the Series B Preferred Stock issued in a Dilutive Issuance for
purposes of this Section B.4(j), any portion of a Dilutive Issuance purchased by an Affiliate of a
Series A Preferred Holder shall be deemed to have been purchased by such Series A Preferred
Holder. If a Dilutive Issuance is permitted to include more than one closing, the conversion
described in this Section B.4(j) shall occur immediately following the earlier of (x) the final such
closing or (y) the final date upon which such closing is permitted to occur.

(k) Limitations _on Adjustments. Anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, no adjustment in the applicable Conversion Price shall be required unless such
adjustment, either by itself or with other adjustments not previously made, would require a
change of at least $.01 in such Conversion Price; provided, however, that any adjustment which
by reason of this paragraph (k) is not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into
account in any subsequent adjustment or immediately prior to any conversion.

5. Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at
all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock,
solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the issued or issuable shares of Series
Preferred Stock, such number of its shares of Common Stock, as the case may be, as shall from
time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of Series Preferred
Stock, and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall

-15-
COLUMBUS/566572.5
not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of Series Preferred Stock,
the Corporation will take all such corporate action as may be necessary to increase its authorized
but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such
purpose.

6. No Closing of Transfer Books. The Corporation shall not close its books
against the transfer of shares of Series Preferred Stock in any manner that would interfere with
the timely conversion of any shares of Series Preferred Stock in accordance with the provisions
hereof.

7. Listing on Securities Exchanges, etc. The Corporation will use
commercially reasonable efforts to (a) list on each national securities exchange (including,

without limitation, the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Global Select Market, the Nasdaq
Global Market or Nasdaq Capital Market), as applicable, on which any Common Stock may at
any time be listed, subject to official notice of issuance upon the conversion of the Series A
Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, all shares of Common Stock from time to time
issuable upon the conversion of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock pursuant to
this Certificate of Incorporation and (b) maintain such listing as long as any Common Stock is
listed.

8. Notice.

(a) Liquidation Events, Extraordinary Transactions, Etc. In the event
(i) the Corporation establishes a record date to determine the holders of any class of securities
who are entitled to receive any dividend or other distribution or who are entitled to vote at a
meeting (or by written consent) in connection with any Liquidation Event or (it) any Liquidation
Event is approved by the Board of Directors or the Corporation enters into any agreement with
respect thereto, the Corporation shall mail or cause to be mailed by first class mail (postage
prepaid) to each holder of Series Preferred Stock at least fifteen (15) days prior to such record

(A) such record date for the purpose of such dividend or distribution or meeting or consent and a
description of such dividend or distribution or the action to be taken at such meeting or by such
consent, (B) the date on which any such Liquidation Event is expected to become effective and,
in the case of a Sale of the Corporation, the identity of the parties thereto, and (C) the date on
which the books of the Corporation shall close or a record shall be taken with respect to any such
event.

(b) Waiver of Notice. The Requisite Series A Stockholders and/or the
Requisite Series B Holders may at any time waive, either prospectively or retrospectively, any
notice provisions specified herein, and any such waiver shall be effective as to all holders of
Series A Preferred Stock and/or all holders of Series B Preferred Stock (as applicable)
upon written notice (including but not limited to notice provided via e-mail) to the Corporation
and to all holders of Series A Preferred Stock and/or all holders of Series B Preferred Stock.

(c) General. In the event that the Corporation provides any notice, report
or statement to holders of Common Stock, the Corporation shall at the same time provide a copy
of any such notice, report or statement to each holder of outstanding shares of Series Preferred

-16-
COLUMBUS/566572.5
Stock.

9. No Reissuance of Preferred Stock. No share or shares of Series A Preferred
Stock or Series B Preferred Stock acquired by the Corporation by reason of redemption,
purchase, conversion or otherwise shall be reissued, and all such shares shall be canceled, retired
and eliminated from the shares that the Corporation shall be authorized to issue.

10. Redemption.

(a) Beginning on April 21, 2010, the Requisite Series B Stockholders shall
have the right to require the Corporation to redeem all, but not less than all, of the Series B
Preferred Stock (the “Series B Redemption”). In connection with the exercise of the Series B
Redemption, a holder of Series B Preferred Stock shall notify the Corporation in writing (the
“Series B Redemption Notice”) of such holder’s election to exercise the rights afforded by this
Section B.10 and the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock to be redeemed with such
Series B Redemption Notice.

(i) Upon receipt of the Series B Redemption Notice, the
Corporation shall promptly notify the remaining holders of the Series B Preferred Stock of the
Series B Redemption.

(ii) | The redemption price for each share of Series B Preferred
Stock shall be cash in an amount equal to the sum of the Series B Purchase Price plus Series B
Preferred Dividends on the date the Redemption (the “Series B Redemption Payment”).

(b) Beginning on April 21, 2010 and (x) subject to there being no shares
of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding, or (y) with the consent of the Requisite Series B
Stockholders, the Requisite Series A Stockholders shall have the right to require the Corporation
to redeem all, but not less than all, of the Series A Preferred Stock (the “Series A Redemption”).
In connection with the exercise of the Redemption, a holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall
notify the Corporation in wniting (the “Series A Redemption Notice”) of such holder's election
to exercise the rights afforded by this Section B.10 and the number of shares of Series A
Preferred Stock to be redeemed with such Series A Redemption Notice.

(i) Upon receipt of the Series A Redemption Notice, the
Corporation shall promptly notify the remaining holders of the Series A Preferred Stock of the
Series A Redemption.

(ii) | The redemption price for each share of Series A Preferred
Stock shall be cash in an amount equal to the sum of the Series A Purchase Price plus Series A
Preferred Dividends on the date the Redemption (the “Series A Redemption Payment”).

(c) If the funds of the Corporation legally available for the applicable
Redemption are insufficient to make the corresponding Redemption Payment in full and redeem
the total number of outstanding shares of applicable Series Preferred Stock, then the holders of
shares of Series Preferred Stock entitled to redemption shall share ratably in any funds legally
available for redemption of such shares according to the respective amounts that would be
payable with respect to the full number of shares owned by them if all such outstanding shares

-|7-
COLUMBUS/566572.5
were redeemed in full. From time to time thereafter when additional funds of the Corporation
are legally available for the redemption of such shares of Series Preferred Stock, such funds will
be used at the earliest permissible time to redeem the balance of such shares, or such portion
thereof for which funds are then legally available.

(d) No share of Series Preferred Stock as to which a holder has exercised
redemption rights hereunder shall be considered redeemed until the holder has received in cash
all amounts provided in this Section B.10 with respect to such share. Such unredeemed shares
shall remain outstanding and shall continue to have all rights provided for herein, including,
dividend, liquidation, conversion and voting rights. In connection with the applicable
Redemption Payment, (i) holders shall as soon as practicable thereafter surrender the certificate
or certificates evidencing the affected Series Preferred Stock, duly assigned or endorsed for
transfer to the Corporation (or accompanied by duly executed stock powers relating thereto) or
an Affidavit of Loss with respect thereto and (ii) the Corporation shall issue new certificates
evidencing the remaining shares of Series Preferred Stock, if any, for which the Redemption
Payment has not been received.

(e) The notices provided for in this Section B.10 shall be sent, if by or on
behalf of the Corporation, to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred
Stock at their respective addresses as shall then appear on the records of the Corporation, or if by
any holder of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock to the Corporation, at its
principal executive office or registered office in Delaware, by first class mail, postage prepaid,
(i) notifying such recipient of the Redemption, the date of such Redemption, the number and
type of shares of Series Preferred Stock to be redeemed, and the amount of the Redemption
Payment and (ii) in the case of any notice by or on behalf of the Corporation, stating the place or
places at which the shares called for redemption shall, upon presentation and surrender of such
certificates representing such shares, be redeemed.

(f) In the event that (i)the Corporation breaches its Redemption
obligations to any holder of Series Preferred Stock, or (ii) the Corporation consents in writing,
then each such holder of Scries Preferred Stock may rescind the Redemption Notice with respect
to all or any remaining portion of his or its shares of Series Preferred Stock at any time prior to
the Corporation’s paying the Redemption Payment therefor in accordance herewith. In addition,
in the event that the Corporation breaches its Redemption obligations to any holder of Series
Preferred Stock by failing to make the Redemption Payment in full when due (a “Redemption
Payment Breach”), then the shares of Series Preferred Stock to have been redeemed, in addition
to the rights provided for herein, including rights to Series A Preferred Dividends under
Section B.2(b) and Series B Preferred Dividends under Section B.2(a), shall accrue interest daily
on the unpaid balance of such Redemption Payment, commencing from the date of the
Redemption Payment Breach, at the per annum rate of 3% compounded annually in arrears on
December 31 of each year such amount remains outstanding.

11. Bank Holding Company Stockholder.

(a) Any holder of Series Preferred Stock that is a “bank holding
company”, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended
from time to time, or a non-bank subsidiary of such bank holding company (a “BHC

- 18 -
COLUMBUS/566572.5
Stockholder”) may, upon notice to the Corporation, elect to hold all or any fraction of such
BHC Stockholder’s Series Preferred Stock (“BHC Stock”) as non-voting stock (“Non-Voting
Stock”), in which case such BHC Stockholder shall not be entitled to vote or otherwise
participate in any consent of the holders of the Series Preferred Stock with respect to the portion
of its BHC Stock which is held as Non-Voting Stock (and such Non-Voting Stock shall not be
counted in determining the giving or withholding any such consent or whether the requisite
percentage of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock have
consented to, approved, adopted or taken any other action hereunder). Except as provided in this
Section B.11, BHC Stock held as Non-Voting Stock shall be identical in all regards to all
other Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, as the case may be, held by the BHC
Stockholder. Upon any transfer of BHC Stock held as Non-Voting Stock to a transferee that is
not a BHC Stockholder, such BHC Stock shall no longer be Non-Voting Stock, and the holder
thereof shall be entitled to all voting rights afforded to holders of other shares of Series A
Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, as the case may be.

(b) Unless otherwise required by the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956
or any implementing regulations, as amended from time to time, any BHC Stock held for its own
account by a BHC Stockholder, that is determined at the time of admission of such BHC
Stockholder as a holder of Series Preferred Stock, as the case may be, the time of any reduction
in the share capital of the Corporation, or the time of any other adjustment of the share capital of
the Corporation, to be 5% or greater of the outstanding Series Preferred Stock, as the case may
be, excluding for purposes of calculating this percentage portions of any other BHC Stock that
are Non-Voting Stock pursuant to this Section B.11, shall be deemed without further action to be
Non-Voting Stock and not be entitled to vote or otherwise participate in any consent of the
holders of the Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock (and such Non-Voting Stock
shall not be counted in determining the giving or withholding any such consent or whether the
requisite percentage of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock
have consented to, approved, adopted or taken any other action hereunder). Upon the occurrence
of any subsequent issuance of Serics A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, a
recalculation of the BHC Stock held by the BHC Stockholders shall be made, and only that
portion of the BHC Stock held by each BHC Stockholder that is determined as of the date of

such recalculation to be 5% or greater of the outstanding Series Preferred Stock shall be Non-
Voting Stock.

C. PREEMPTIVE RIGHTS; VOTING; ELECTION OF DIRECTORS; EXIT
TRANSACTION,

1. Preemptive Rights. Until the first to occur of a Majority Conversion of all
Series Preferred Stock or a Qualified Public Offering, the Corporation shall only issue New
Securities in accordance with the following terms:

(a) The Corporation shall not issue any New Securities unless it first
delivers to each Qualified Holder of Series Preferred Stock and each Qualified Holder of Special
Common Stock (each such Qualified Holder being referred to in this Section C.1 as a “Buyer”) a
wnitten notice (the “Notice of Proposed Issuance”’) specifying the type and total number of such
New Securities that the Corporation then intends to issue (the “Offered New Securities’), all of
the material terms, including the price upon which the Corporation proposes to issue the Offered

-19-
COLUMBUS/566572.5
New Securities and the time period of the offering, and stating that the Buyers, as a group, shall
have the right to purchase the Preemptive Portion of the Offered New Securities in the manner
specified in this Section C.1 for the same price per share and in accordance with the same terms
and conditions specified in such Notice of Proposed Issuance provided that the Buyer may pay
cash for any non-cash consideration at the fair market value thereof as determined in good faith
by the Board of Directors.

(b) During the fifteen (15) consecutive day period commencing on the
date the Corporation delivers to all of the Buyers the Notice of Proposed Issuance (the “Fifteen
Day Period”), the Buyers shall have the option to purchase the Preemptive Portion of the
Offered New Securities at the same price per share and upon the terms and conditions identical
in all material respects to those specified in the Notice of Proposed Issuance. Each Buyer
electing to purchase Offered New Securities must give written notice of its election to the
Corporation prior to the expiration of the Fifteen Day Period. If the Offered New Securities are
being offered as part of an investment unit together with debt or other instruments, any election
by a Buyer to purchase Offered New Securities shall also constitute an election to purchase a like
portion of such debt or other instruments.

(c) The Buyers, as a group, shall have the right to purchase that number of
the Offered New Securities as shall be equal to the number of the Offered New Securities
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the sum of the number of shares of
Common Stock then held by such Buyers plus all shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of all Convertible Securities then held by such Buyers and the denominator of which
shall be the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock Deemed Outstanding (such number,
the “Preemptive Portion”). Each Buyer, individually, shall have the right to purchase that
number of the Offered New Securities as shall be equal to the number of the Offered New
Securities multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the sum of the number of
shares of Common Stock then held by such Buyer plus all shares of Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of all Convertible Securities then held by such Buyer and the denominator of
which shall be the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock Deemed Outstanding (such
number, the “Proportionate Share”).

(d) Each Buyer shall have a right of oversubscription such that if any other
Buyer fails to elect to purchase his or its full Proportionate Share of the Offered New Securities,
the other Buyer(s) shall, among them, have the right to purchase up to the balance of the
Preemptive Portion of such Offered New Securities not so purchased. The Buyers may exercise
such right of oversubscription by electing to purchase more than their Proportionate Share by so
indicating in their written notice given during the Fifteen Day Period. If, as a result thereof, such
over subscription clections exceed the total amount of the Preemptive Portion available in
respect to such oversubscription privilege, the oversubscribing Buyers shall be cut back with
respect to oversubscriptions on a pro rata basis in accordance with their respective Proportionate
Shares or as they may otherwise agree among themselves.

(e) The Corporation shall have the right, until the expiration of sixty (60)
consecutive days commencing on the first day immediately following the expiration of the
Fifteen Day Period, to issue all or any of the Preemptive Portion of the Offered New Securities
not purchased by the Buyers at not less than, and on terms no more favorable to the purchaser(s)

-20-
COLUMBUS/566572.5
thereof than, the price and other terms specified in the Notice of Proposed Issuance. If for any
reason the shares comprising such remaining Preemptive Portion of the Offered New Securities
are not issued within such period and at such price and on such terms, the right to issue in
accordance with the Notice of Proposed Issuance shall expire and the provisions of this
Section C.1 shall continue to be applicable to the Offered New Securities.

(f) The Requisite Series B Stockholders may waive, either prospectively
or retrospectively, any or all of the rights arising under this Section C.1 with respect to all
holders of Series B Preferred Stock. The Requisite Series A Stockholders may waive, either
prospectively or retrospectively, any or all of the nghts arising under this Section C.1 with
respect to all holders of Series A Preferred Stock. The Qualified Holders holding a majority of
the outstanding shares of Special Common Stock may waive, either prospectively or
retrospectively, any or all of the rights arising under this Section C.1 with respect to all holders
of Special Common Stock.

(g) The Corporation may proceed with the issuance of New Securities
without first following the foregoing procedures provided that (i) the purchaser of such New
Securities agrees in writing to be bound by this Section C.1(g), and (ii) within ten (10) days
following the issuance of such New Securities, the Corporation or the purchaser of the New
Securities undertakes steps substantially similar to those described above to offer to all Buyers
the right to purchase from such purchaser or from the Corporation such amount of such New
Securities at the same price and terms applicable to the purchaser’s purchase thereof as is
necessary to provide the Buyers with substantially the same dilution protection offered by this
Section C.1 as if the procedures set forth above had been followed prior to the issuance of such
New Securities.

2. Voting Generally. Except as expressly set forth herein, the holder of each
share of Series Preferred Stock shall vote with holders of Common Stock, voting together as
single class, upon all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. For such purpose, each holder
of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to the number of votes
per share of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, as the case may be, as equals
the largest number of shares of Common Stock into which each share of Series A Preferred
Stock or Series B Preferred Stock may be converted pursuant to Section B.3 on the record date
fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote or on the effective date of any written
consent of stockholders, as applicable. Fractional votes shall not, however, be permitted and any
fractional voting rights resulting from the above formula with respect to any holder of Series A
Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock shall be rounded to the nearest whole number (with
one-half rounded upward to one). Notwithstanding Section 228(a) of the DGCL and except as
otherwise provided herein, no action that is required by the DGCL to be taken by stockholders at
any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation or that may be taken by
stockholders at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation may be taken
without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote unless a consent or consents in
writing setting forth the action so taken shall be signed by the Requisite Series A Stockholders
and Requisite Series B Stockholders. There shall be no cumulative voting.

COLUMBUS/566572.5
3. Board of Directors. The Corporation’s board of directors (the “Board” or
the “Board of Directors”) shall consist of seven (7) individuals, except as otherwise provided in
this Section C.2 or unless the Requisite Series A Stockholders, the Requisite Series B
Stockholders and the holders of Common Stock, each voting separately as a single class for such
purposes, shall otherwise consent. The Board of Directors shall be elected as follows:

(a) two (2) directors of the Corporation shall be elected by the
holders of Special Common Stock, voting separately as a single class for such purpose (such
director being referred to as the “Special Common Director Designees”);

holders of the Regular Common Stock, voting separately as a single class for such purpose (such
directors being referred to as the ‘Regular Common Director Designees”); and

(c) two (2) directors of the Corporation shall be elected by the
holders of the Series Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class for such purpose (such
directors being referred to as the “Series Preferred Director Designees’’).

4. Election of Directors.
