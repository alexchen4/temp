Common Stock on such date; provided, however, that if the conversion is in connection with an
underwritten offer of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act or a merger, sale, financing,
or liquidation of the Corporation or other event, the ponversion may, at the option of any holder
tendering Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing of such transaction or
upon the occurrence of such event, in which case the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock

Preferred Stock that the Corporation shall be required under this Section 6 to redeem on any one (1)

shares of each such series outstanding prior to the first Redemption Date by three (3). Ifthe funds
legally available for redemption of the Preferred Stook shall be insufficient to permit the payment to
such holders of the full respective Redemption Prices, the Corporation shall effect such redemption

Price without interest upon surrender of their certificate or certificates) shall cease with respect to the
shares designated for redemption on such date, and such shares shall not thereafter be transferred on
the books of the Corporation or be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose whatsoever. If the
funds of the Corporation legally available for redemption of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and
Series B Preferred Stock on any Redemption Date are insufficient to redeem the total number of
shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such date, those

shares ratably among the holders of such shares to be redeemed based upon their holdings of Series
A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock. The shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series
B Preferred Stock not redeemed shall remain outstanding and entitled to all the rights and
preferences provided herein. At any time thereafter when additional funds of the Corporation are
