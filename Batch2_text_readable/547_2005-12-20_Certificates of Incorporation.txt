4955415 v8 118452 301 5
The number of shares of Preferred Stock that this Corporation shall be required to redeem on any
one Redemption Date shall bce cqual to the amount determined by dividing (x) the aggregate
number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding immediatcly prior to such Redemption Date that
have been requested to be redeemed pursuant to this Section 3(a) by (y) the number of remaining
Redemption Dates (including the Redemption Date to which such calculation applies). Upon
any redemption under this Section 3, each series of Preferred Stock shall rank upon redemption
in the same priority as such series of Preferred Stock ranks upon a liquidation, dissolution and
winding up of the Corporation as set forth in Section 2, No amounts shall be paid to a series of
Preferred Stock ranking upon liquidation junior to another series of Preferred Stock unless the
redemption payments contemplated by this Section 3 shall have been first made to all of the
outstanding shares of the senior series of Preferred Stock. Subject to the foregoing, any
redemption of shares of Preferred Stock effected pursuant to this subsection 3(a) shall be made
on a pro rata basis among the holders of shares of Preferred Stock in proportion to the number of
shares proposed to be redeemed by such holders. Should any redemption installment not be paid
on the applicable Redemption Date, then such redemption installment shall bear simple interest
at onc percent (1%) per month from such Redemption Date; provided, however, that no interest
shall accrue on any redemption installment to the extent that the Corporation is not legally
permitted to pay such redemption installment.

(b) At least fifteen but no more than thirty days prior to each Redemption
Date, written notice shall be mailed, first class postage prepaid, to each holder of record (at the
close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given) of
Preferred Stock to be redeemed, at the address last shown on the records of this Corporation for
such holder, notifying such holder of the redemption to be effected on the applicable Redemption
Date, specifying the number of shares to be redeemed from such holder, the Redemption Date,
the Redemption Price, the place at which payment may be obtaincd and calling upon such holder
to surrender to this Corporation, in the manner and at the place designated, his, her or its
certificate or certificates representing the shares to be redeemed (the “Redemption Notive”).
Except as provided in subsection 3(c), on or after each Redemption Date, each holder of shares
of Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such Redemption Date shall surrender to this Corporation
the certificate or certificates representing such shares, in the manner and at the place designated
in the Redemption Notice, and thereupon the applicable Redemption Price of such shares shall
be payable to the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as
the owner thereof and each surrendered certificate shall be cancelled. In the event less than all
the shares represented by any such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued
representing the unredeemed shares.

(c) From and after each Redemption Date, unless there shall have been a
default in payment of the Redemption Price, all rights of the holders of shares of Preferred Stock
designated for redemption on such Redemption Date in the Redemption Notice as holders of
shares of Preferred Stock (except the right to receive the applicable Redemption Price without
interest upon surrender of their certificate or certificates) shall cease with respect to such shares,
and such shares shall not thereafter be transferred on the books of this Corporation or be deemed
to be outstanding for any purpose whatsoever. If the funds of this Corporation legally available
for redemption of shares of Preferred Stock on a Redemption Date are insufficient to redeem the
total number of shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such date, those funds that are
legally available will be used to redeem the maximum possible number of such shares of each

HSSS415 v5. 118452 G01 6
series of Preferred Stock in the same priority as such series of Preferred Stock ranks upon a
liquidation, dissolution and winding up of the Corporation as set forth in Section 2 and then
ratably among the holders of’ shares of any series of Preferred Stock ranking pari passu on the
basis of the number of such shares which would be redeemed on such date if the funds of this
Corporation legally available therefor had been sufficient to redeem all shares required to be
redeemed on such date. ‘he shares of Preferred Stock not redeemed shall remain outstanding
and entitled to all the rights and preferences provided herein. At any time thereafter when
additional funds of this Corporation are legally available for the redemption of shares of
Preferred Stock, such funds will be used to redeem the balance of the shares that this Corporation
has become obliged to redeem on any Redemption Date but that it has not redeemed, and such
redemption shall occur based on the priorities set forth above as soon as practicable after such
additional funds become legally available.

certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of this Corporation or of any
transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to this Corporation at its
principal corporate office, of the election to convert the same and shal] state therein the name or

Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such
holder of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as
aforesaid. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of
business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the
person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion
shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock
as of such date. If the conversion is in connection with an Initial Public Offering, the conversion
may, at the option of any holder tendering Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon
the closing with the underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering, in which

(a) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance
(including shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to subsection 4(d)(iii)(D)(!)

#355418 v5 418452 SCI 8

A eter et a ee te fe eee ee ee
or (2)) multiplied by the then applicable Conversion Price and (b) the aggregate consideration, if
any, received by this Corporation upon such issuance by (ii) the sum of (a) the number of shares

shares of such Additional Stack.

(ii) No de Minimus Adjustments. No adjustment of the Conversion

carried forward and shall be either taken into account in any subsequent adjustment made prior

Directors,

(D) Inthe case of the issuance (whether before, at or afler the
date hereof) of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common Stock, securities by their

distribution.

thereafter, no longer apply.
