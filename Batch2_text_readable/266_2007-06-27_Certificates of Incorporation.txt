their entirety to read as follows:

“
The name of the Corporation is Agensys, Inc.
II.

The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which a
corporation may be organized under the General Corporation Law of California other than the
banking business, the trust company business or the practice of a profession permitted to be
incorporated by the California Corporations Code.

I.

A. This Corporation is authorized to issue two classes of stock to be designated,
respectively, “Common Stock” and “Preferred Stock.” The total number of shares which the
Corporation is authorized to issue is One Hundred Four Million Thirty Thousand (104,030,000)
shares, Sixty-One Million Five Hundred Thousand (61,500,090) shares of which shall be
Common Stock (the “Common Stock”), and Forty-Two Million Five Hundred Thirty Thousand
(42,530,000) shares of which shall be Preferred Stock (the “Preferred Stock”).

B. The Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series. The
Board of Directors is hereby authorized, within the limitations and restrictions stated in these
Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (the “Restated Articles”), to fix or alter the
dividend rights, dividend rate, conversion rights, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption
(including sinking fund provisions), the redemption price or prices, the liquidation preferences of
any wholly unissued series of Preferred Stock, and the number of shares censtituting any such
series and the designation thereof, or any of them; and to increase or decrease the number of
shares of any series subsequent to the issue of shares of that series, but not below the number of
shares of such series then outstanding. In case the number of shares of any series shall be so
decreased, the shares constituting such decrease shall resume the status which they had prior to
the adoption of the resolution originally fixing the number of shares of such series.

C. Four Million Thirty Thousand (4,030,000) of the authorized shares of Preferred
Stock are hereby designated “Series A Preferred Stock” (the “Series A Preferred’), Five
Million (5,000,000) of the authorized shares of Preferred Stock are hereby designated “Series B
Preferred Stock” (the “Series B Preferred”), Nineteen Million Five Hundred Thousand

a eee ee
(19,500,000) of the authorized shares of Preferred Stock are hereby designated ‘Series C
Preferred Stock” (the “Series C Preferred") and Fourteen Million (14,000,000) of the
authorized Preferred Stock are hereby designed ‘Series D Preferred Stock” (the “Series D
Preferred”). The Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred, the Series C Preferred and Series D
Preferred are collectively referred to herein as the “Serles Preferred.”

D. The rights, preferences, privileges, restrictions and cther matters relating to the
Series Preferred are as follows:

1. Dividend Rights.

(a) Holders of Series Preferred, in preference to the holders of any
other stock of the Corporation (“Junior Stock"), shall be entitled to receive, when and as
declared by the Board of Directors, but only out of funds that are legally available therefor, cash
dividends at the rate of six percent (6%) of the “Original Issue Price” per annum on each
outstanding share of Series Preferred (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits,
recapitalizations and the like with respect to such shares of Series Preferred). The Original Issue
Price of the Series A Preferred shall be two dollars ($2.00), the Original Issue Price of the Series
B Preferred shall be two dollars and fifty cents ($2.50), the Original Issue Price of the Series C
Preferred shall be three dollars and fifteen cents ($3.15) and the Original Issue Price of the Series
D Preferred shall be three dollars and sixty cents ($3.60). Such dividends shal} be payable only
when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors and approved by the vote or written consent
of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding Series Preferred voting together as a single
class on an as-converted to Common Stock basis. Such dividends shall be non-cumulative and

shall be paid on a pro-rata, pari passu basis in proportion to the respective dividend rates
therefor.

(b) So long as any shares of Series Preferred shall be outstanding, no
dividend, whether in cash or property, shall be paid or declared, nor shall any other distribution
be made, on any Junior Stock, nor shall any shares of any Junior Stock of the Corporation be
purchased, redeemed, or otherwise acquired for value by the Corporation (except for acquisitions
of Common Stock by the Corporation pursuant to agreements which permit the Corporation to
repurchase such shares upon termination of services to the Corporation or in exercise of the
Corporation’s right of first refusal upon a proposed transfer at a price not greater than the amount
paid by such service provider for such shares or the then-current fair market value of such shares
(as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company), as provided in the applicable
agreement) until all dividends (set forth in Section 1(a) above) on the Series Preferred shall have
been paid or declared and set apart. In the event dividends are paid on any share of Common
Stock, an additional dividend shall be paid with respect to all outstanding shares of Series
Preferred in an amount equal per share (on an as-if-converted to Common Stock basis) to the
amount paid or set aside for each share of Common Stock. The provisions of this Section 1(b)
shall not, however, apply to (i) a dividend payable in Common Stock, (ii) the acquisition of
shares of any Junior Stock in exchange for shares of any other Junior Stock, or (iii) any
repurchase of any outstanding securities of the Corporation that is unanimously approved by the
Corporation’s Board of Directors. The holders of the Series Preferred expressly waive their

market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

4. Conversion Rights.

The holders of the Series Preferred shal! have the following rights with respect to
the conversion of the Series Preferred into shares of Common Stock (the “Conversion Rights"):

(a) Optional Conversion. Subject to and in compliance with the
provisions of this Section 4, any shares of Series Preferred may, at the option of the holder, be
converted at any time into fully-paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock. The number
of shares of Common Stock to which a holder of Series A Preferred shall be entitled upon
conversion shall be the product obtained by multiplying the “Series A Conversion Rate” then in
effect (determined as provided in Section 4(b)) by the number of shares of Series A Preferred
being converted. The number of shares of Common Stock to which a holder of Series B
Preferred shall be entitled upon conversion shall be the product obtained by multiplying the
“Series B Conversion Rate” then in effect (determined as provided in Section 4(b)) by the
number of shares of Series B Preferred being converted. The number of shares of Common
Stock to which a holder of Series C Preferred shall be entitled upon conversion shall be the
product obtained by multiplying the “Series C Conversion Rate” then in effect (determined as
provided in Section 4(b)) by the number of shares of Series C Preferred being converted. The
number of shares of Common Stock to which a holder of Series D Preferred shall be entitled
upon conversion shall be the product obtained by multiplying the “Series D Conversion Rate”

then in effect (determined as provided in Section 4(b)) by the number of shares of Series D
Preferred being converted.

(b) Conversion Rate.

(i) The conversion rate in effect at any time for conversion of
the Series A Preferred (the “Series A Conversion Rate”) shall be the quotient obtained by
dividing the Original Issue Price of the Series A Preferred by the “Series A Conversion Price,”
calculated as provided in Section 4(c).

(ii) | The conversion rate in effect at any time for conversion of
the Series B Preferred (the “Series B Conversion Rate”) shall be the quotient obtained by
dividing the Original Issue Price of the Series B Preferred by the “Series B Conversion Price,”
calculated as provided in Section 4(c).

(iii) | The conversion rate in effect at any time for conversion of
the Series C Preferred (the “Series C Conversion Rate”) shall be the quotient obtained by
dividing the Original Issue Price of the Series C Preferred by the “Series C Conversion Price,”
calculated as provided in Section 4(c).
(iv) The conversion rate in effect at any time for conversion of
the Series D Preferred (the “Series D Conversion Rate”) shall be the quotient obtained by
dividing the Original Issue Price of the Series D Preferred by the “Series D Conversion Price,”
calculated as provided in Section 4(c).

(c) Converston Price. The conversion price for each series of Series
Preferred shall initially be the Original Issue Price of such series of Series Preferred (the “Series
Preferred Conversion Price” for such series). Such initial Series Preferred Conversion Price
shall be adjusted from time to time in accordance with this Section 4. All references to the

Series Preferred Conversion Price herein shall mean the Series Preferred Conversion Price us so
adjusted.

(d) Mechanics of Conversion. Each holder of Series Preferred who
desires to convert the same into shares of Common Stock pursuant to this Section 4 shall
surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or
any transfer agent for the Series Preferred, and shall give written notice to the Corporation at
such office that such holder elects to convert the same. Such notice shall state the number of
shares of Series Preferred being converted. Thereupon, the Corporation shall promptly issue and
deliver at such office to such holder a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled and shall promptly pay in cash or, to the extent
sufficient funds are not then legally available therefor, in Common Stock (at the Common
Stock’s fair market value determined by the Board of Directors as of the date of such
conversion), any declared and unpaid dividends on the shares of Series Preferred being
converted. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made at the close of business on the
date of such surrender of the certificates representing the shares of Series Preferred to be
converted, and the person entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such
conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such shares of Common Stock
on such date; provided, however, that if the conversion is in connection with an underwritten
offer of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act or an Acquisition or Asset Transfer,
the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering Preferred Stock for conversion, be
conditioned upon the closing of such transacticn, in which event the holder entitled to receive the
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to
have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such transaction.

(e) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If the
Corporation shall at any time or from time to time after the date on which these Amended and
Restated Articles of Incorporation are filed with the Secrete-y of State of the State of California
(the “Effective Date”) effect a subdivision of the outstanding Common Stock, the Series
Preferred Conversion Price for each series of Series Preferred then in effect immediately before
that subdivision shall be proportionately decreased. Conversely, if the Corporation shall at any
time or from time to time after the Effective Date combine the outstanding shares of Common
Stock into a smaller number of shares, the Series Conversion Price for each series of Series
Preferred then in effect immediately before the combination shall be proportionately increased.
Any adjustment under this Section 4(e) shall become effective at the close of business on the
date the subdivision or combination becomes effective.
(t) Adjustment for Common Stock Dividends and Distributions.
If the Corporation at any time or trom time to time after the Effective Date makes, or fixes a
record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or
other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock, in cach such event the Series
Preferred Conversion Price for each series then in effect shall be decreased as of the time of such
issuance or, in the event such record date is fixed, as of the close of business on such record date,
by multiplying the Series Preferred Conversion Price for each series of Series Preferred then in
effect by a fraction (1) the numerator of which is the total number of shares of Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of business on
such record date, and (2) the denominator of which is the total number of shares of Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of
business on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of
such dividend or distribution; provided, however, that if such record date is fixed and such
dividend is not fully paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the
Series Preferred Conversion Price for each series shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close
of business on such record date and thereafter the Series Preferred Conversion Price for each
series shall be adjusted pursuant to this Section 4(f) to reflect the actual payment of such
dividend or distribution.

(g) Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. If the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Effective Date makes, or fixes a record
date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other
distribution payable in securities of the Corporation other than shares of Common Stock, in each
such event provision shall be made so that the holders of the Series Preferred shall receive upon
conversion thereof, in addition to the number of shares of Common Stock receivable thereupon,
the amount of other securities of the Corporation which they would have received had their
Series Preferred been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event and had they
thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to and including the conversion date,
retained such securities receivable by them as aforesaid during such period, subject to all other
adjustments called for during such period under this Section 4 with respect to the rights of the
holders of the Series Preferred or with respect to such other securities by their terms.

(h) Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. If
at any time or from time to time after the Effective Date, the Common Stock issuable upon the
conversion of the Series Preferred is changed into the same or a different number of shares of
any Class or classes of stock, whether by recapitalization, reclassification or otherwise (other than
an Acquisition or Asset Transfer as defined in Section 3(c) or a subdivision or combination of
shares or stock dividend or a reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale of assets provided for
elsewhere in this Section 4), in any such event each holder of Series Preferred shall have the
right thereafter to convert such stock into the kind and amount of stock and other securities and
property receivable upon such recapitalization, reclassification or other change by holders of the
maximum number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series Preferred could
have been converted immediately prior to such recapitalization, reclassification or change, all
subject to further adjustment as provided herein or with respect to such other securities or
property by the terms thereof.
(i) Reorganizations, Mergers, Consolidations or Sales of Assets. If
at any time or from time to time after the Effective Date, there is a capital reorganization of the
Common Stock (other than an Acquisition or Asset Transfer as defined in Section 3(c) or as
recapitalization, subdivision, combination, reclassification, exchange or substitution of shares
provided for elsewhere in this Section 4), as a part of such capital reorganization, provision shall
be made so that the holders of the Series Preferred shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon
conversion of the Series Preferred the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of
the Corporation to which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon
conversion would have been entitled on such capital reorganization, subject to adjustment in
respect of such stock or securities by the terms thereof. In any such case, appropriate adjustment
shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 4 with respect to the rights of
the holders of Series Preferred after the capital reorganization to the end that the provisions of
this Section 4 (including adjustment of the Series Preferred Conversion Price then in effect and
the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Series Preferred) shall be applicable after
that event and be as nearly equivalent as practicable.

(j) Sale of Shares Below Scries Preferred Conversion Price.

(i) If at any time or from time to time after the Effective Date,
the Corporation issues or sells, or is deemed by the express provisions of this subsection (j) to
have issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock (as hereinafter defined), other than as a
dividend or other distribution on any class of stock as provided in Section 4(f) above, and other
than a subdivision or combination of shares of Common Stock as provided in Section 4(¢) above,
for an Effective Price (as hereinafter defined) less than the then effective Series Preferred
Conversion Price for each series, the then existing Series Preferred Conversion Price for such
series shall be reduced, as of the opening of business on the date of such issue or sale,

(A) _ in the case of the Series D Preferred, to a price
determined by multiplying the Series D Conversion Price by a fraction (1) the numerator
of which shall be (x) the number of shares of Common Stock deemed outstanding (as
defined below) immediately prior to such issue or sale (but excluding any shares of
Common Stock which would be deemed outstanding upon conversion of the Series D
Preferred), plus (y) the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate
consideration received (as defined in subsection (j)(ii)) by the Corporation for the total
number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued would purchase at such
Conversion Price, and (2) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Stock deemed outstanding (as defined below) immediately prior to such issue
or sale (but excluding any shares of Common Stock which would be deemed outstanding
upon conversion of the Series D Preferred) plus the total number of Additional Shares of
Common Stock so issued;

(B) in the case of the Series C Preferred, Series B
Preferred and Series A Preferred, to a price determined by multiplying the applicable
Series Preferred Conversion Price by a fraction (1) the numerator of which shall be (x)
the number of shares of Common Stock deemed outstanding (as defined below)
immediately prior to such issue or sale, plus (y) the number of shares of Common Stock
which the aggregate consideration received (as defined in subsection (j)(ii)) by the

10

cate tetas syne se ees

ee ee tee ee
Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued would
purchase at such Conversion Price, and (2) the denominator of which shall be the number
of shares of Common Stock deemed outstanding (as defined below) immediately prior to
such issue or sale plus the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued.

For the purposes of this Section 4(j), the number of shares
of Common Stock deemed to be outstanding as of a given date shall be the sum of (X) the
number of shares of Common Stock actually outstanding, (Y) the number of shares of Common
Stock into which the then outstanding shares of Series Preferred could be converted if fully
converted on the day immediately preceding the given date, and (Z) the number of shares of
Common Stock which cculd be obtained through the exercise or conversion of all other rights,
options and convertible securities on the day immediately preceding the given date.

(ii) For the purpose of making any adjustment required under
this Section 4(j), the consideration received by the Corporation for any issue or sale of securities
shall (A) to the extent it consists of cash, be computed at the aggregate amount of cash received
by the Corporation before deduction of any underwriting or similar commissions, compensation
or concessions paid or allowed by the Corporation in connection with such issue or sale, (B) to
the extent it consists of property other than cash, be computed at the fair value of that property as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, and (C) if Additional Shares of Common
Stock, Convertible Securities (as hereinafter defined) or rights or options to purchase either
Additional Shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities are issued or sold together with
other stock or securities or other assets of the Corporation for a consideration which covers both,
be computed as the portion of the consideration so received that may be reasonably determined
in good faith by the Board of Directors to be allocable to such Additional Shares of Common
Stock, Convertible Securities or rights or options.

(iii) For the purpose of the adjustment required under this
Section 4(j), if the Corporation issues or sells any rights or options for the purchase of, or stock
or other securities convertible into, Additional Shares of Common Stock (such convertible stock
or securities being herein referred to as “Convertible Securities”) or rights or options for the
purchase of Convertible Securities, and if the Effective Price of such Additional Shares of
Common Stock is less than the Series Conversion Price for any series, in each case the
Corporation shall be deemed to have issued at the time of the issuance of such rights or options
or Convertible Securities the maximum number of Additional Shares of Common Stock issuable
upon exercise or conversion thereof and to have received as consideration for the issuance of
such shares an amount equal to the total amount of the consideration, if any, received by the
Corporation for the issuance of such rights or options or Convertible Securities, plus, in the case
of such rights or options, the minimum amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the
Corporation upon the exercise of such rights or options, plus, in the case of Convertible
Securities, the minimum amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Corporation (other than
by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities, including
the elimination of liquidation preference and cancellation of accrued dividends) upon the
conversion thereof; provided that if in the case of Convertible Securities the minimum amounts
of such consideration cannot be ascertained, but are a function of antidilution or similar
protective clauses, the Corporation shall be deemed to have received the minimum amounts of
consideration without reference to such clauses; provided further that if the minimum amount of

consideration payable to the Corporation upon the exercise or conversion of rights, options or
Convertible Securities is reduced over time or on the occurrence or non-occurrence of specified
events other than by reason of antidilution adjustments, the Effective Price shall be recalculated
using the figure to which such minimum amount of consideration is reduced; provided further
that if the minimum amount of consideration payable to the Corporation upon the exercise or
conversion of such rights, options or Convertible Securities is subsequently increased, the
Effective Price shall be again recalculated using the increased minimum amount of consideration
payable to the Corporation upon the exercise or conversion of such rights, options or Convertible
Securities. No further adjustment of the Series Preferred Conversion Price, as adjusted upon the
issuance of such rights, options or Convertible Securities, shall be made as a result of the actual
issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock on the exercise of any such rights or options or
the conversion of any such Convertible Securities. If any such rights or options or the
conversion privilege represented by any such Convertible Securities shall expire without having
been exercised, the Series Preferred Conversion Price as adjusted upon the issuance of such
rights, options or Convertible Securities shall be readjusted to the Series Preferred Conversion
Price which would have been in effect had an adjustment been made on the basis that the only
Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued were the Additional Shares of Common Stock, if
any, actually issued or sold on the exercise of such rights or options or rights of conversion of
such Convertible Securities, and such Additional Shares of Common Stock, if any, were issued
or sold for the consideration actually received by the Corporation upon such exercise, plus the
consideration, if any, actually received by the Corporation for the granting of all such rights or
options, whether or not exercised, plus the consideration received for issuing or selling the
Convertible Securities actually cciverted, pius the consideration, if any, actually received by the

Convertible Securities, including the elimination of liquidation preference and cancellation of
accrued dividends) on the conversion of such Convertible Securities, provided that such
readjustmert shall not apply to prior conversions of Series Preferred.

class on an as-converted to Common Stock basis, or (B) immediately upon the closing of a
Qualified Public Offering. Upon such automatic conversion, any declared and unpaid dividends
shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of Section 4(d),

(ii) | Upon the automatic conversion of all of the Preferred Stock
pursuant to paragraph (i) above, the outstanding shares of Series Preferred shall be converted
automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the
certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent;
provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion unless the certificates evidencing such
shares of Series Preferred are either delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent as provided
below, or the holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been
lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify
the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates. Upon the

of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the

obtaining the consents required under Section 2 of this Article III, the Corporation shall not
