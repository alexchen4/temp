D. The rights, preferences, privileges, restrictions and other matters relating to the
Series Preferred are as follows:

1. DIVIDEND RIGHTS.

(a) Holders of Series Preferred, in preference to the holders of Common

series of Series Preferred per annum on each outstanding share of Series Preferred (as adjusted
for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like with respect to such
shares after the filing date hereof). Such dividends shall accrue on each share of Series Preferred
from the date on which such shares are issued, and shall accrue from day to day until paid,
regardless of whether earned or declared. Dividends shall not compound.

(b) The “Original Issue Price” shall be $0.261361 per share for the Series
A-1 Preferred, $0.287497 per share for the Series A-2 Preferred and $0.339 per share for the

on the Common Stock, or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire for value any shares of
Common Stock until all dividends as set forth in Section 1(a) above on the Series Preferred shall
have been paid or declared and set apart.

(d) In the event dividends are paid on any share of Common Stock,
whether in cash or property, the Company shal! pay an additional dividend on all outstanding
shares of Series Preferred in a per share amount equal (on an as-if-converted to Common Stock
basis) to the amount paid or set aside for each share of Common Stock.
(e) The provisions of Sections 1(c) and (d) shall not apply to (i) a dividend
payable in Common Stock, (ii) acquisitions of Common Stock by the Company pursuant to
agreements which permit the Company to repurchase such shares at cost (or the lesser of cost or
fair market value) upon termination of services to the Company; (iii) acquisitions of Common
Stock in exercise of the Company’s night of first refusal to repurchase such shares, provided, that
such exercise is approved by the Board, including the affirmative approval of the Series

Company that is approved by (x) the Board and (y) the Series Preferred, which approval may be
evidenced by the written approval of the Series Designees.

property other than cash, the value of such dividend shall be the fair market value of such
distribution as determined in good faith by the Board.

2. VOTING RIGHTS.

(a) General Rights. Each holder of shares of the Series Preferred shall be
entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of shares of Common Stock into which such
shares of Series Preferred could be converted (pursuant to Section 5 hereof) immediately after the
close of business on the record date fixed for such meeting or the effective date of such written
consent and shall have voting rights and powers equal to the voting rights and powers of the
Common Stock, except that the holders of the Series Preferred shall not be entitled to vote in
connection with any election for or removal of directors elected pursuant to the provisions of
Section 2(c)(ii) below, and shall be entitled to notice of any stockholders’ meeting in accordance
with the bylaws of the Company. Except as otherwise provided herein or as required by law, the
Series Preferred shall vote together with the Common Stock at any annual or special meeting of
the stockholders and not as a separate class, and may act by written consent in the same manner
as the Common Stock.

(b) Separate Vote of Series Preferred. For so long as any shares of
Series Preferred remain outstanding, in addition to any other vote or consent required herein or
by law, the vote or written consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series
Preferred, voting together as a single class on an as-if converted to Common Stock basis, shall be
necessary for the Company to effect or validate any of the following actions (whether by merger
or consolidation, or otherwise) or to permit any subsidiary of the Company to effect or validate
any of the following actions (whether by merger or consolidation, or otherwise):

(i) Any amendment, alteration, or repeal of any provision of
the Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Company (including any filing of a
Certificate of Designation), that alters or changes the voting or other powers, preferences, or
other special rights or privileges, or restrictions of any of the Series Preferred so as to adversely
affect the holders of Series Preferred;

(ii) | Any increase in the authorized number of shares of Series
Preferred;
(iii) | Any authorization, issuance or any designation, whether by
reclassification or otherwise, of any new class or series of stock or any other securities
convertible into equity securities of the Company having rights, preferences and privileges on a
parity with or senior to the Series Preferred with respect to dividends, liquidation preference,
voting, antidilution protection or redemption;

{iv) | Any redemption or repurchase of the Company’s Common
Stock or Preferred Stock (except for acquisitions of Common Stock by the Company permitted
by Section 1 hereof and pursuant to Section 6 below entitled “Redemption of Series Preferred”);

(v) Any agreement by the Company or its stockholders
regarding an Asset Transfer or Acquisition (each as defined in Section 4(b) below);

(vi) Any action that results in the payment or declaration of a
dividend on any shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock (other than as required pursuant to
Section 1 above);

(vii) Any voluntary dissolution or liquidation of the Company;
or

(viii) Any increase or decrease in the authorized number of
members of the Company’s Board.

(c) Election of Board of Directors.

(i) For so long as any shares of Series Preferred remain
outstanding, the holders of Series Preferred, voting together as a single class on an as-if
converted to Common Stock basis, shall be entitled to elect two (2) members of the Board
(collectively, the “Series Designees”) at each meeting or pursuant to each consent of the
Company’s stockholders for the election of directors, and to remove from office such directors
and to fill any vacancy caused by the resignation, death or removal of such directors;

(ii) The holders of Common Stock, voting as a separate class,
shall be entitled to elect two (2) members of the Board at each mecting or pursuant to each
consent of the Company’s stockholders for the election of directors, and to remove from office
such directors and to fill any vacancy caused by the resignation, death or removal of such
directors; and

(iii) | The holders of Common Stock and Series Preferred, voting
together as a single class on an as-if converted to Common Stock basis, shall be entitled to elect
all remaining members of the Board, at each meeting or pursuant to each consent of the
Company’s stockholders for the election of directors, and to remove from office such directors
and to fill any vacancy caused by the resignation, death or removal of such directors.
3. LIQUIDATION RIGHTS.

(a) Upon any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company,
whether voluntary or involuntary (a “Liquidation Event’), before any distribution or payment
shall be made to the holders of any Common Stock, the holders of Series Preferred shall be
entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Company legally available for distribution, or the
consideration received in such transaction, for each share of Series Preferred held by them, an
amount per share of Series Preferred equal to the sum of (i) the applicable Original Issue Price
for such series of Series Preferred plus (ii) all accrued dividends and all declared and unpaid
dividends on such Series Preferred (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits,
recapitalizations and the like with respect to such shares after the filing date hereof). If, upon any
such liquidation, dissolution, or winding up, the assets of the Company (or the consideration
received in such transaction) shall be insufficient to make payment in full to all holders of Series
Preferred of the liquidation preference set forth in this Section 3(a), then such assets (or
consideration) shall be distributed among the holders of Series Preferred at the time outstanding,

ratably in proportion to the full amounts to which they would otherwise be respectively entitled if
such amounts had been paid in full.

(b) After the payment of the full liquidation preferences of the Series
Preferred as set forth in Section 3(a) above, the remaining assets of the Company legally
available for distribution (or the consideration received in such transaction), if any, shall be
distributed ratably to the holders of the Common Stock and Series Preferred on an as-if converted
to Common Stock basis.

4, ASSET TRANSFER OR ACQUISITION RIGHTS.

(a) If the Company is a party to an Acquisition or Asset Transfer (each as
hereinafter defined), then the holders of Series Preferred shall receive upon the closing of such
Acquisition or Asset Transfer, out of the proceeds of such Acquisition or Asset Transfer, the
amount of cash, securities or other property to which such holders would be entitled to receive in
a Liquidation Event pursuant to Section 3 hereof (including application of the preferences
contained therein) in lieu of the consideration otherwise payable to the stockholders of the
Company in connection with such Acquisition or Asset Transfer, provided, however, the holders
of the majority of the outstanding Series Preferred may by vote or written consent, elect to waive
the right to treat such Acquisition or Asset Transfer as a deemed liquidation, such Acquisition or
Asset Transfer shall not be considered a deemed liquidation under Section 3.

(b) For the purposes of this Article IV: (i) “Acquisition” shall mean (A)
any consolidation, stock exchange or merger of the Company with or into any other corporation
or other entity or person, or any other corporate reorganization, in which the stockholders of the
Company immediately prior to such consolidation, merger or reorganization, own less than fifty
percent (50%) of the voting power of the surviving entity (or if the surviving entity is a wholly-
owned subsidiary, its parent) immediately after such consolidation, merger or reorganization; or
(B) any transaction or series of related transactions to which the Company is a party in which in
excess of fifty percent (50%) of the Company’s voting power is transferred; provided that an
Acquisition shall not include (x) any consolidation or merger effected exclusively to change the
domicile of the Company, or (y) any transaction or series of transactions principally for bona fide
equity financing purposes in which cash is received by the Company or any successor or
indebtedness of the Company is cancelled or converted or a combination thereof; and (ii) “Asset
Transfer’ shall mean a sale, lease or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of
the Company or the sale, exclusive license, conveyance, exchange or other transfer of all or
substantially all of the intellectual property of the Company.

(c) In any Acquisition or Asset Transfer, (i) if the consideration to be
received is securities of a corporation or other property other than cash, its value will be deemed
its fair market value as determined in good faith by the Board on the date such determination is
made, (ii) any payments or proceeds that could be made or distributed following the closing of
any Acquisition or Asset Transfer as the result of termination or expiration of an escrow or
operation of an carn-out or similar arrangement or termination of dissenter’s or appraisal rights,
shall be treated for the purposes of this Section 4 as if paid at the closing of such Acquisition or
Asset Transfer, and (iii) any personal gain to one or more stockholder(s) of the Company, such as
employment or consulting contracts, in excess of reasonable compensation, or reasonable non-
compete payments in excess of the designated sale price of the business, shall be used in
calculating the total consideration being paid for the business and the holders of Series Preferred
shall share in the total calculations based on their percentage ownership of the Company’s
Common Stock, including for such purposes shares issuable upon conversion of the Series
Preferred; provided, however, that any publicly-traded securities to be distributed to stockholders
will be valued as follows:

(i) Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar
restrictions on free marketability:

{A)If traded on a securities exchange, the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange over the thirty
(30)-day period ending three (3) calendar days prior to the closing; and

(B) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever are applicable) over the
thirty (30)-day period ending three (3) calendar days prior to the closing.

(ii) | The method of valuation of securities subject to investment
letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of
a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount
from the market value determined as above in Sections 4(c)(i)(A) and (B) to reflect the
approximate fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4, if the
definitive transaction documents for an Acquisition or Asset Transfer provide for a different

method of valuation, the method of valuation set forth in such documents shall control.

5. CONVERSION RIGHTS.
The holders of the Series Preferred shall have the following rights with

respect to the conversion of the Series Preferred into shares of Common Stock (the “Conversion
Rights”):

(a) Optional Conversion. Subject to and in compliance with the
provisions of this Section 5, any shares of Series Preferred may, at the option of the holder, be
converted at any time into fully-paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock. The number
of shares of Common Stock to which a holder of Series Preferred shall be entitled upon
conversion shall be the product obtained by multiplying the applicable “Series Preferred
Conversion Rate” then in effect for such series of Series Preferred (determined as provided in
Section 5(b)) by the number of shares of such series of Series Preferred being converted.

(b) Series Preferred Conversion Rate. The conversion rate in effect at
any time for conversion of each series of Series Preferred (the “Series Preferred Conversion
Rate” for such series) shall be the quotient obtained by dividing the applicable Original Issue
Price for such series of Series Preferred by the applicable “Series Preferred Conversion Price”
for such series of Series Preferred, calculated as provided in Section 5S(c).

(c) Series Preferred Conversion Price. The conversion price for each
series of Series Preferred shall initially be the Original Issue Price of such series of Series
Preferred (the “Series Preferred Conversion Price”). Such initial Series Preferred Conversion
Price shall be adjusted from time to time in accordance with this Section 5. All references to the

Series Preferred Conversion Price herein shall mean the applicable Series Preferred Conversion
Price as so adjusted.

(d) Mechanics of Conversion. Each holder of Series Preferred who
desires to convert the same into shares of Common Stock pursuant to this Section 5 shall
surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Company or
any transfer agent for the Series Preferred, and shall give written notice to the Company at such
office that such holder elects to convert the same. Such notice shall state the number of shares of
Series Preferred being converted. Thereupon, the Company shall promptly issue and deliver at
such office to such holder a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock
to which such holder is entitled and shall promptly pay (i) in cash or, to the extent sufficient
funds are not then legally available therefor, in Common Stock (at the Common Stock’s fair
market value determined by the Board as of the date of such conversion), any accrued and any
declared and unpaid dividends on the shares of Series Preferred being converted and (ii) in cash
(at the Common Stock’s fair market value determined by the Board as of the date of conversion)
the value of any fractional share of Common Stock otherwise issuable to any holder of Series
Preferred. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made at the close of business on the
date of such surrender of the certificates representing the shares of Series Preferred to be
converted, and the person entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such
conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such shares of Common Stock
on such date.

(e) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If at any time or
from time to time after the date that the first share of Series A-3 Preferred is issued (the
“Original Issue Date’) the Company effects a subdivision of the outstanding Common Stock
without a corresponding subdivision of any series of Series Preferred, the applicable Series
Preferred Conversion Price for such series of Series Preferred in effect immediately before that
subdivision shall be proportionately decreased. Conversely, if at any time or from time to time
after the Original Issue Date the Company combines the outstanding shares of Common Stock
into a smaller number of shares without a corresponding combination of any series of Series
Preferred, the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price for such series of Series Preferred in
effect immediately before the combination shall be proportionately increased. Any adjustment
under this Section 5(e) shall become effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision
or combination becomes effective.

(f) Adjustment for Common Stock Dividends and Distributions. If at
any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date the Company pays to holders of
Common Stock a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock in additional shares of
Common Stock without a corresponding dividend or other distribution to holders of Preferred
Stock, each Series Preferred Conversion Price that is then in effect shall be decreased as of the
time of such issuance, as provided below:

() Each Series Preferred Conversion Price for each series of
Series Preferred shall be adjusted by multiplying each applicable Series Preferred Conversion
Price then in effect by a fraction:

(A) the numerator of which is the total number of shares of
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance, and

(B) the denominator of which is the total number of shares
of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance plus the
number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution;

(ii) If the Company fixes a record date to determine which
holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution, each Series
Preferred Conversion Price shall be fixed as of the close of business on such record date and the
number of shares of Common Stock shall be calculated immediately prior to the close of
business on such record date; and

(iii) If such record date is fixed and such dividend is not fully
paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, each Series Preferred
Conversion Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record date
and thereafter each Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this Section
5(f) to reflect the actual payment of such dividend or distribution.

(g) Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange, Substitution,
Reorganization, Merger or Consolidation. If at any time or from time to time after the
Original Issue Date, the Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Series Preferred is
changed into the same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by
recapitalization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or otherwise (other than an Acquisition or
Asset Transfer as defined in Section 4 or a subdivision or combination of shares or stock
dividend or a reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale of assets provided for elsewhere in
this Section 5), in any such event each holder of Series Preferred shall then have the right to
convert such stock into the kind and amount of stock and other securities and property receivable
upon such recapitalization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or other change by holders of
the maximum number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series Preferred
could have been converted immediately prior to such recapitalization, reclassification, merger,
consolidation or change, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein or with respect to
such other securities or property by the terms thereof. In any such case, appropriate adjustment
shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 5 with respect to the rights of
the holders of Series Preferred after the capital reorganization to the end that the provisions of
this Section 5 (including adjustment of the Series Preferred Conversion Price then in effect and
the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Series Preferred) shall be applicable after
that event and be as nearly equivalent as practicable.

(h) Sale of Shares Below Series Preferred Conversion Price.

(i) If at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue
Date, the Company issues or sells, or is deemed by the express provisions of this Section 5(h) to
have issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock (as defined below), other than as
provided in Section 5(e), S(f) or 5(g) above, for an Effective Price (as defined below) less than
the then-effective Series Preferred Conversion Price for any series of Series Preferred (a
“Qualifying Dilutive Issuance”), then and in each such case, the then-effective Series Preferred
Conversion Price for such series of Series Preferred shall be reduced, as of the opening of
business on the date of such issue or sale, to a price (calculated to the eighth (8") digit to the
right of the decimal point) determined by multiplying the applicable Series Preferred Conversion
Price for such series of Series Preferred in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale by a
fraction:

(A) the numerator of which shall be (i) the number of shares
of Common Stock deemed outstanding (as determined below) immediately prior to such issue or
sale, plus (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock which the Aggregate Consideration (as
defined below) received or deemed received by the Company for the total number of Additional
Shares of Common Stock so issued would purchase at such then-effective applicable Series
Preferred Conversion Price, and

(B) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares
of Common Stock deemed outstanding (as determined below) immediately prior to such issue or
sale plus the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued.

(ii) | For the purposes of the preceding sentence, the number of
shares of Common Stock deemed to be outstanding as of a given date shall be the sum of (A) the
number of actually issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock on the day immediately
preceding the given date, (B) the number of shares of Common Stock into which the then
outstanding shares of Series Preferred could be converted if fully converted on the day
immediately preceding the given date, plus (C) the number of shares of Common Stock which
could be obtained through the exercise or conversion of all other rights, options and convertible
securities outstanding on the day immediately preceding the given date.

(iii) No adjustment shall be made to the applicable Series
Preferred Conversion Price in an amount less than one cent per share. Any adjustment otherwise
required by this Section 5(h) that is not required to be made due to the preceding sentence shall
be included in any subsequent adjustment to such Series Preferred Conversion Price.

(iv) For the purpose of making any adjustment required under
this Section 5(h), the aggregate consideration received by the Company for any issue or sale of
securities (the “Apgregate Consideration’) shall be computed as follows: (A) to the extent it
consists of cash, Aggregate Consideration shall be computed at the gross amount of cash
received by the Company before deduction of any underwriting or similar commissions,
compensation or concessions paid or allowed by the Company in connection with such issue or
sale and without deduction of any expenses payable by the Company, (B) to the extent it consists
of property other than cash, Aggregate Consideration shall be computed at the fair value of that
property as determined in good faith by the Board, and (C) if Additional Shares of Common
Stock, Convertible Securities (as defined below) or rights or options to purchase either
Additional Shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities are issued or sold together with
other stock or securities or other assets of the Company for a consideration which covers both,
Aggregate Consideration shall be computed as the portion of the consideration so received that
may be reasonably determined in good faith by the Board to be allocable to such Additional
Shares of Common Stock, Convertible Sccurities or rights or options.

(v) For the purpose of the adjustment required under this
Section S(h), if the Company issues or sells (x) Preferred Stock or other stock, options, warrants,
purchase rights or other securities convertible into, Additional Shares of Common Stock (such
convertible stock or securities being herein referred to as “Convertible Securities”) or (y) rights
or options for the purchase of Additional Shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities and
if the Effective Price of such Additional Shares of Common Stock is less than any Series
Preferred Conversion Price, in each case the Company shall be deemed to have issued at the time
of the issuance of such rights or options or Convertible Securities the maximum number of
Additional Shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise or conversion thereof and to have
received as consideration for the issuance of such shares an amount equal to the total amount of
the consideration, if any, received by the Company for the issuance of such rights or options or
Convertible Securities plus:

(A)in the case of such rights or options, the minimum
amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon the exercise of such rights or
options; and

(B)in the case of Convertible Securities, the minimum
amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon the conversion thereof (other
than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities);
provided that if the minimum amounts of such consideration cannot be ascertained, but are a
function of antidilution or similar protective clauses, the Company shall be deemed to have
received the minimum amounts of consideration without reference to such clauses.

(C) If the minimum amount of consideration payable to the
Company upon the exercise or conversion of rights, options or Convertible Securities is reduced
over time or on the occurrence or non-occurrence of specified events other than by reason of
antidilution adjustments, the Effective Price shall be recalculated using the figure to which such
minimum amount of consideration is reduced; provided further, that if the minimum amount of
consideration payable to the Company upon the exercise or conversion of such rights, options or
Convertible Securities is subsequently increased, the Effective Price shall be again recalculated
using the increased minimum amount of consideration payable to the Company upon the exercise
or conversion of such nghts, options or Convertible Securities.

(D)No further adjustment of any Series Preferred
Conversion Price, as adjusted upon the issuance of such rights, options or Convertible Securities,
shall be made as a result of the actual issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock or the
exercise of any such rights or options or the conversion of any such Convertible Securities. If
any such rights or options or the conversion privilege represented by any such Convertible
Securities shall expire without having been exercised, the applicable Series Preferred Conversion
Price as adjusted upon the issuance of such rights, options or Convertible Securities shall be
readjusted to the Series Preferred Conversion Price which would have been in effect had an
adjustment been made on the basis that the only Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued
were the Additional Shares of Common Stock, if any, actually issued or sold on the exercise of
such rights or options or rights of conversion of such Convertible Securities, and such Additional
Shares of Common Stock, if any, were issued or sold for the consideration actually received by
the Company upon such exercise, plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the
Company for the granting of all such rights or options, whether or not exercised, plus the
consideration received for issuing or selling the Convertible Securities actually converted, plus
the consideration, if any, actually received by the Company (other than by cancellation of
liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities) on the conversion of such
Convertible Securities, provided that such readjustment shall not apply to prior conversions of
Series Preferred.

(vi) For the purpose of making any adjustment to the
Conversion Price of the Series Preferred required under this Section 5(h), “Additional Shares of
Common Stock’ sha\\ mean all shares of Common Stock issued by the Company or deemed to
be issued pursuant to this Section 5(h) (including shares of Common Stock subsequently
reacquired or retired by the Company), other than:

(A)shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of the
Series Preferred;

(B) shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities
issued after the Original Issue Date to employees, officers or directors of, or consultants or
advisors to the Company or any subsidiary, pursuant to the Company’s 2005 Equity Incentive
Plan or such other stock purchase or stock option plan or other arrangements that are approved by
the Board (including the affirmative approval of the Series Designees);

(C)shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to the
exercise of Convertible Securities outstanding as of the Original Issue Date;

(D)shares of Common Stock, Preferred Stock and
Convertible Securities issued for consideration other than cash pursuant to a merger,
consolidation, acquisition, strategic alliance or similar business combination approved by the
Board (including the affirmative approval of the Series Designees);

(E)shares of Common Stock, Preferred Stock and
Convertible Securities issued pursuant to any equipment loan or leasing arrangement, real
property leasing arrangement or debt financing from a bank or similar financial institution
approved by the Board (including the affirmative approval of the Series Designees);

(F) shares of Common Stock, Preferred Stock and
Convertible Securities issued to third-party service providers in exchange for or as partial
consideration for services rendered to the Company; provided, that the issuance of such shares
has been approved by the Board (including the affirmative approval of the Series Designees); or

(G)shares of Common Stock, Preferred Stock and
Convertible Securities issued in connection with strategic transactions involving the Company
and other entities, including (i) joint ventures, manufacturing, marketing or distribution
arrangements or (ii) technology transfer or development arrangements approved by the Board
(including the affirmative approval of the Series Designees).

References to Common Stock in the subsections of this clause (v) above shall mean all
shares of Common Stock issued by the Company or deemed to be issued pursuant to this
Section 5(h). The “Effective Price” of Additional Shares of Common Stock shall mean the
quotient determined by dividing the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock issued
or sold, or deemed to have been issued or sold by the Company under this Section 5(h), into the
Aggregate Consideration received, or deemed to have been received by the Company for such
issue under this Section 5(h), for such Additional Shares of Common Stock. In the event that the
number of shares of Additional Shares of Common Stock or the Effective Price cannot be
ascertained at the time of issuance, such Additional Shares of Common Stock shall be deemed
issued immediately upon the occurrence of the first event that makes such number of shares or
the Effective Price, as applicable, ascertainable.

(vii) In the event that the Company issues or sells, or is deemed
to have issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock in a Qualifying Dilutive Issuance

to have issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock in a Qualifying Dilutive Issuance
other than the First Dilutive Issuance (a “Subsequent Dilutive Issuance”) pursuant to the same
instruments as the First Dilutive Issuance, then and in each such case upon a Subsequent Dilutive
Issuance the Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be reduced to the Series Preferred
Conversion Price that would have been in effect had the First Dilutive Issuance and each
Subsequent Dilutive Issuance all occurred on the closing date of the First Dilutive Issuance.

(i) Waiver of Antidilution Protection. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, any provision of Section 5(h) and any adjustments made or required to be made to the

mail, postage prepaid, to each registered holder of such series of Series Preferred at the holder’s

purpose of such dividend or distribution and a description of such dividend or distribution,
(B) the date on which any such Acquisition, reorganization, reclassification, transfer,
consolidation, merger, Asset Transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to

Common Stock (or other securities) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock
(or other securities) for securities or other property deliverable upon such Acquisition,
reorganization, reclassification, transfer, consolidation, merger, Asset Transfer, dissolution,
liquidation or winding up.

(l) Automatic Conversion.

(i) Each share of Series Preferred shall automatically be
converted into shares of Common Stock, based on the then-effective applicable Series Preferred
Conversion Price for such series of Series Preferred, (A) at any time upon the affirmative election
of (x) the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series A-1/A-2 Preferred (voting
together on an as-if converted basis) and (y) the holders of a majority of the Series A-3 Preferred
(voting as a separate class), or (B) immediately upon the closing of a firmly underwritten public
offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, covering the offer and sale of Common Stock for the account of the Company in which
(i) the per share price is at least five (5) times the Original Issue Price for the Series A-1
Preferred (as adjusted for stock splits, dividends, recapitalizations and the like after the filing
date hereof), and (ii) the gross cash proceeds to the Company (after underwriting discounts,
commissions and fees) are at least $30,000,000 (a “Qualified Public Offering’). Upon such
automatic conversion, any declared and unpaid dividends shall be paid in accordance with the
provisions of Section 5(d). In addition, (x) each share of Series A-1 Preferred shall automatically
be converted into shares of Common Stock, based on the then-effective Series Preferred
Conversion Price for the Series A-1 Preferred, at any time upon the affirmative election of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series A-1 Preferred, (y) each share of
Series A-2 Preferred shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock, based on the
then-effective Series Preferred Conversion Price for the Series A-2 Preferred, at any time upon
the affirmative election of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series A-2
Preferred and (z) each share of Series A-3 Preferred shall automatically be converted into shares
of Common Stock, based on the then-effective Series Preferred Conversion Price for the Series
A-3 Preferred, at any time upon the affirmative election of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of the Series A-3 Preferred.

(if) Upon the occurrence of either of the events specified in
Sections 5(1)(iA) or (B) above, or as provided pursuant to Sections 5(1)(i)(x), (y) or (z), the
respective outstanding shares of Series Preferred shall be converted automatically without any
further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates representing such
shares are surrendered to the Company or its transfer agent; provided, however, that the
Company shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion unless the certificates evidencing such shares of Series Preferred
are either delivered to the Company or its transfer agent as provided below, or the holder notifies
the Company or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and
executes an agreement satisfactory to the Company to indemnify the Company from any loss
incurred by it in connection with such certificates. Upon the occurrence of such automatic
conversion of the Series Preferred, the holders of such Series Preferred shall surrender the
certificates representing such shares at the office of the Company or any transfer agent for the
Series Preferred. Thereupon, there shall be issued and delivered to such holder promptly at such
office and in its name as shown on such surrendered certificate or certificates, a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series Preferred
surrendered were convertible on the date on which such automatic conversion occurred, and any
declared and unpaid dividends shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of Section 5(d).

(m)Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be
issued upon conversion of Series Preferred. All shares of Common Stock (including fractions
thereof) issuable upon conversion of more than one share of Series Preferred by a holder thereof
shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the conversion would result in the
issuance of any fractional share. If, after the aforementioned aggregation, the conversion would
result in the issuance of any fractional share, the Company shall, in lieu of issuing any fractional
share, pay cash equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by the Common Stock’s fair
market value (as determined by the Board) on the date of conversion.

(n) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Company
shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common
Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Series Preferred,
such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding shares of the Series Preferred. If at any time the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall! not be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all then outstanding shares of the Series Preferred, the Company will take such corporate
action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.

(0) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Section 5 shail
be in writing and shall be deemed effectively given: (i) upon personal delivery to the party to be
notified, (ii) when sent by confirmed electronic mail or facsimile if sent during normal business
hours of the recipient; if not, then on the next business day, (iii) five (5) days after having been
sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or (iv) one (1) day
after deposit with a nationally recognized overnight courier, specifying next day delivery, with
verification of receipt. All notices shall be addressed to each holder of record at the address of
such holder appearing on the books of the Company.

(p) Payment of Taxes. The Company will pay all taxes (other than taxes
based upon income) and other governmental charges that may be imposed with respect to the
issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of shares of Series Preferred,
excluding any tax or other charge imposed in connection with any transfer involved in the issue
and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in which the shares of Series
Preferred so converted were registered.

(q) Special Mandatory Conversion.
(i) In the event that any holder of shares of Series A-1/A-2

Preferred does not participate in a Qualified Financing (as defined below) by purchasing in the
aggregate, in such Qualified Financing and within the time period specified by the Company

15.
(provided that the Company has given such holder at least fifteen (15) days written notice of the
Qualified Financing), such holder’s Pro Rata Amount (as defined below), then each share of
Series A-1/A-2 Preferred held by such holder shall automatically, and without any further action
on the part of such holder, be converted into shares of Common Stock at the applicable Series
Preferred Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the consummation of such Qualified
Financing, effective upon, subject to, and concurrently with, the consummation of the Qualified
Financing. For purposes of determining the number of shares of Series A-1/A-2 Preferred owned
by a holder, and for determining the number of Offered Securities a holder of Series Preferred
has purchased in a Qualified Financing, all shares of Series A-1/A-2 Preferred held by Affiliates
(as defined below) of such holder shall be aggregated with such holder’s shares and all Offered
Securities purchased by Affiliates of such holder shall be aggregated with the Offered Securities
purchased by such holder (provided that no shares or securities shall be attributed to more than
one entity or person within any such group of affiliated entities or persons). Upon such
conversion (a “Special Mandatory Conversion”), any shares of Series A-1/A-2 Preferred so
converted shall be cancelled and not subject to reissuance.

(ii) | Upon a Special Mandatory Conversion, each holder of
shares of Series A-1/A-2 Preferred converted pursuant to Section 5(q) shal] surrender his, her or
its certificate or certificates for all such shares to the Company at the place designated in such
notice, and shall thereafter receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Section 5(q). All rights with respect to the Series
A-1/A-2 Preferred converted pursuant to this Section 5(q), including the nghts, if any, to receive
notices and vote (other than as a holder of Common Stock), will terminate, except only the rights
of the holders thereof, upon surrender of their certificate or certificates therefor, to receive
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which such Series A-1/A-2 Preferred
has been converted, and payment of any accrued but unpaid dividends thereon. If so required by
the Company, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by
written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Company, duly executed
by the registered holder or by his, her or its attorney duly authorized in writing. As soon as
practicable after the Special Mandatory Conversion and the surrender of the certificate or
certificates for Series A-1/A-2 Preferred so converted, the Company shall cause to be issued and
delivered to such holder, or on his, her or its written order, a certificate or certificates for the
number of full shares of Common Stock issuable on such conversion in accordance with the
provisions hereof and cash as provided in Section 5(b) in respect of any fraction of a share of
Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion.

(iii) All certificates evidencing shares of Series A-1/A-2
Preferred which are required to be surrendered for conversion in accordance with the provisions
hereof shall, from and after the time of the Special Mandatory Conversion, be deemed to have
been retired and cancelled, and the shares of Series A-1/A-2 Preferred converted pursuant to this
Section 5(q) represented thereby shall, from and after the time of the Special Mandatory
Conversion, be deemed to have been converted into Common Stock for all purposes,
notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender such certificates on or
prior to such date. The Company may thereafter take such appropriate action (without the need

for stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Series
Preferred accordingly.

16.
(iv) For purposes of this Section 5(q), the following definitions
shall apply:

(A) “Affiliate” shall mean, with respect to any holder of
shares of Series A-1/A-2 Preferred, any person, entity or firm which, directly or indirectly,
controls, is controlled by or is under common control with such holder, including, without
limitation, any entity of which the holder is a partner or member, any partner, officer, director,
member or employee of such holder and any venture capital fund now or hereafter existing of
which the holder is a partner or member which is controlled by or under common control with
one or more general partners of such holder or shares the same management company with such
holder.

(B) “Offered Securities’ shall mean the equity
securities of the Company set aside by the Board for purchase by holders of outstanding shares of
Series A-1/A-2 Preferred in connection with a Qualified Financing, and offered to such holders.

(C) “Pro Rata Amount’ shall mean, with respect to any
holder of Series A-1/A-2 Preferred, the lesser of (a) a number of Offered Securities calculated by
multiplying the aggregate number of Offered Securities by a fraction, the numerator of which is
equal to the number of shares of outstanding Common Stock owned by such holder, and the
denominator of which is equal to the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock owned by all
holders of outstanding shares of Common Stock (for the purpose of this definition, treating all
shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise or conversion of Convertible Securities
outstanding immediately prior to such Qualified Financing as outstanding), or (b) the maximum
number of Offered Securities that such holder is permitted by the Company to purchase in such
Qualified Financing, after giving effect to any cutbacks or limitations established by the Board
and applied on a pro rata basis to all holders of Series A-1/A-2 Preferred.

@) “Qualified Financing” shall mean any transaction
involving the issuance or sale of equity securities of the Company after the Original Issue Date
which would result in the reduction of the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price for a
series of Series A-1/A-2 Preferred pursuant to the terms of Section S(h) of this Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation, unless the holders of at least a majority of the Series A-
1/A-2 Preferred, voting together as a class on an as-converted basis, elect otherwise by written
notice given to the Company at least ten (10) days prior to the consummation of the Qualified
Financing.

6. REDEMPTION OF SERIES PREFERRED.

(a) The Company shall be obligated to redeem the Series Preferred as
follows:

(i) The holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of
Series Preferred, voting together as a separate class, by delivering written notice to the Company
(the “Redemption Request’), may require the Company, to the extent it may lawfully do so, to
redeem the Series Preferred in three (3) annual installments beginning at any date on or after the

17.
fifth anniversary of the Original Issue Date, and ending on the date two (2) years from such first
redemption date (each a ‘Redemption Date’’), provided that the date of the Redemption Request
shall be at least thirty (30) days prior to the first Redemption Date. The Company shall effect the
redemptions of the Series Preferred on the applicable Redemption Date by paying in cash in
exchange for the shares of Series Preferred to be redeemed a sum equal to the applicable Original
Issue Price per share of Series Preferred (as adjusted for any share dividends, combinations,
splits, recapitalizations and the like after the filing date hereof) plus all accrued dividends and all
declared but unpaid dividends with respect to such shares. The total amount to be paid for the
Series Preferred is hereinafter referred to as the “Redemption Price.” The number of shares of
Series Preferred that the Company shall be required to redeem on any one Redemption Date shall
be equal to the amount determined by dividing (A) the aggregate number of shares of Series
Preferred outstanding immediately prior to the Redemption Date by (B) the number of remaining
Redemption Dates (including the Redemption Date to which such calculation applies). Shares
subject to redemption pursuant to this Section 6(a) shall be redeemed from each holder of Series
Preferred on a pro rata basis, based on the number of shares of Series Preferred then held.

(ii) Within ten (10) days after receipt of the Redemption
Request, the Company shall send a notice (the “Redemption Notice”) to all holders of Series
Preferred setting forth (A) the Redemption Price for the shares to be redeemed, (B) the
Redemption Dates, and (C) the place at which such holders may obtain payment of the
Redemption Price upon surrender of their share certificates. If the Company does not have
sufficient funds legally available to redeem all shares to be redeemed at the Redemption Date,
then it shall so notify such holders and shall redeem such shares pro rata (based on the portion of
the aggregate Redemption Price payable to them) to the extent possible and shall redeem the
remaining shares to be redeemed as soon as sufficient funds are legally available.

(iii) | On or prior to such Redemption Date, the Company shall
deposit the Redemption Price of all shares to be redeemed with a bank or trust company having
aggregate capital and surplus in excess of $100,000,000, as a trust fund, with irrevocable
instructions and authority to the bank or trust company to pay, on and after such Redemption
Date, the Redemption Price of the shares to their respective holders upon the surrender of their
share certificates. Any moneys deposited by the Company pursuant to this Section 6(b) for the
redemption of shares thereafter converted into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 5
hereof no later than the fifth (Sth) day preceding the Redemption Date shall be returned to the
Company forthwith upon such conversion. The balance of any funds deposited by the Company
pursuant to this Section 6(b) remaining unclaimed at the expiration of one (1) year following
such Redemption Date shall be returned to the Company promptly upon its written request.

(b) On or after each such Redemption Date, each holder of shares of Series
Preferred to be redeemed shall surrender such holder’s certificates representing such shares to the
Company in the manner and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice, and thereupon the
Redemption Price of such shares shall be payable to the order of the person whose name appears
on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof and cach surrendered certificate shall be
canceled. In the event less than all the shares represented by such certificates are redeemed, a
new cettificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares. From and after each
Redemption Date, unless there shall have been a default in payment of the Redemption Price or

18.
the Company is unable to pay the Redemption Price due to not having sufficient legally available
funds, all rights of the holder of such shares (except the right to receive the Redemption Price
without interest upon surrender of their certificates), shall cease and terminate with respect to
such shares; provided that in the event that shares of Series Preferred are not redeemed due to a
default in payment by the Company or because the Company does not have sufficient legally
available funds, such shares of Series Preferred shall remain outstanding and shall be entitled to
all of the rights and preferences provided herein until redeemed.

(c) In the event of a call for redemption of any shares of Series Preferred,
the Conversion Rights (as defined in Section 5) for such Series Preferred shall terminate as to the
shares designated for redemption at the close of business on the fifth (5th) day preceding the
applicable Redemption Date, unless default is made in payment of the Redemption Price.

7. No REISSUANCE OF SERIES PREFERRED.

No shares of Series Preferred acquired by the Company by reason of redemption,
purchase, conversion or otherwise shall be reissued.

that is a holder of Preferred Stock and that is in the business of investing and reinvesting in other
entities (cach, a “Fund”) acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter in such person’s
capacity as a partner or employee of the Fund and that may be a corporate opportunity for both
the Company and such Fund (a “Corporate Opportunity”), then (i) such Corporate Opportunity
shall belong to such Fund, (ii) such director shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, have
fully satisfied and fulfilled his fiduciary duty to the Company and its stockholders with respect to
such Corporate Opportunity, and (iii) the Company, to the fullest extent permitted by law, waives
