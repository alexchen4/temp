noncumulative dividends at the annual Dividend Rate for such series of Senior Preferred Stock, prior and
in preference to the payment of any dividend on the Junior Preferred Stock and Common Stock (other
than a Common Stock Dividend). No dividends (other than a Common Stock Dividend) shall be paid,
with respect to the Junior Preferred Stock and/or Common Stock during any calendar year unless
dividends in the total amount of the annual Dividend Rate for each such series of Senior Preferred Stock
shall have first been paid or declared and set apart for payment to the holders of the of each such series of
Senior Preferred Stock during that calendar year; provided, however, that this restriction shall not apply
to Permitted Repurchases. Payment of any dividends to the holders of each such series of Senior
Preferred Stock shall be paid pro rata, on an equal priority, pari passu basis according to their respective
dividend preferences as set forth herein. Dividends on the Senior Preferred Stock shall not be mandatory
or cumulative, and no rights or interest shall accrue to the holders of the Senior Preferred Stock by reason
of the fact that the Corporation shall fail to declare or pay dividends on the Senior Preferred Stock in the
amount of the annual Dividend Rate for each such series of Senior Preferred Stock or in any other
amount in any calendar year or any fiscal year of the Corporation, whether or not the earnings of the
Corporation in any calendar year or fiscal year were sufficient to pay such dividends in whole or in part.

2.2 Junior Preferred Stock. Subject to the prior dividend rights of the Senior
Preferred Stock set forth in subsection 2.1, in each calendar year, the holders of the then outstanding
shares of each series of Junior Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the
Board, out of any funds and assets of the Corporation legally available therefor, noncumulative dividends
at the annual Dividend Rate for such series of Junior Preferred Stock, prior and in preference to the
payment of any dividends on the Common Stock in such calendar year (other than a Common Stock
Dividend). No dividends (other than a Common Stock Dividend) shall be paid, with respect to the
Common Stock during any calendar year unless dividends in the total amount of the annual Dividend
Rate for each such series of Junior Preferred Stock shall have first been paid or declared and set apart for
payment to the holders of each such series of Junior Preferred Stock during that calendar year; provided,
however, that this restriction shall not apply to Permitted Repurchases. Payments of any dividends to the
holders of each such series of Junior Preferred Stock shall be paid pro rata, on an equal priority, pari
passu basis according to their respective dividend preferences as set forth herein. Dividends on the
Junior Preferred Stock shall not be mandatory or cumulative, and no rights or interest shall accrue to the
holders of the Junior Preferred Stock by reason of the fact that the Corporation shall fail to declare or pay
dividends on the Preferred Stock in the amount of the annual Dividend Rate for each such series of

such dividends in whole or in part.

2.3 Common Stock. If, after dividends in the full preferential amounts specified in
subsections 2.1 and 2.2 above for the Preferred Stock have been paid or declared and set apart in any
calendar year of the Corporation, the Board shall declare additional dividends out of funds legally
available therefor in that calendar year, then such additional dividends shall be declared solely on the
Common Stock, provided, however, that in no event shall any dividends be paid or declared on the

3 2504 1/00010/DOCS/2441 669.6
Common Stock at a rate greater than the rate at which dividends are paid on the Preferred Stock in any
calendar year (based on the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Preferred Stock is then
convertible) provided, further, that no dividend will be paid on the Common Stock, so long as any
Preferred Stock remains outstanding, without the written consent of the holders of at least a majority of
the Preferred Stock then outstanding, voting as a single class on an as-converted to Common Stock basis.

2.4 Non-Cash Dividends. Whenever a dividend provided for in this Section 2 shall
be payable in property other than cash, the value of such dividend shall be deemed to be the fair market
value of such property as determined in good faith by the Board.

3. Liquidation Rights. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, the funds and assets that may be legally distributed to the
Corporation’s stockholders (the “Available Funds and Assets’) shall be distributed to stockholders in the
following manner:

3.1 Senior Preferred Stock. The holders of each share of each series of Senior
Preferred Stock then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid, out of the Available Funds and Assets, and
prior and in preference to any payment or distribution (or any setting apart of any payment or
distribution) of any Available Funds and Assets on any shares of Junior Preferred Stock or Common
Stock, an amount per share equal to the Original Issue Price of each such series of Senior Preferred Stock
plus all declared but unpaid dividends on such series of Senior Preferred Stock. If upon any liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the Available Funds and Assets shall be insufficient to
permit the payment to holders of the Senior Preferred Stock of their full preferential amount described in
this subsection 3.1, then the entire Available Funds and Assets shall be distributed among the holders of
the then outstanding Senior Preferred Stock pro rata, on an equal priority, pari passu basis, according to
their respective liquidation preferences as set forth herein.

3.2 Junior Preferred Stock. Subject to payment in full of the liquidation preference
of the Senior Preferred Stock as set forth in subsection 3.1, the holders of each share of each series of
Junior Preferred Stock then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid, out of the Available Funds and
Assets, and prior and in preference to any payment or distribution (or any setting apart of any payment or
distribution) of any Available Funds and Assets on any shares of Common Stock, an amount per share
equal to forty percent the Original Issue Price of each such series of Junior Preferred Stock plus all
declared but unpaid dividends on such series of Junior Preferred Stock. If upon any liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the Available Funds and Assets shall be insufficient to
permit the payment to holders of the Junior Preferred Stock of their full preferential amount described in
this subsection 3.2, all of the remaining Available Funds and Assets shall be distributed among the
holders of the then outstanding Junior Preferred Stock pro rata, on an equal priority, pari passu basis,
according to their respective liquidation preferences as set forth herein.

3.3 Remaining Assets. If there are any Available Funds and Assets remaining after
the payment or distribution (or the setting aside for payment or distribution) to the holders of the
Preferred Stock of their full preferential amounts described above in subsections 3.1 and 3.2, then all
such remaining Available Funds and Assets shall be distributed among the holders of the then
outstanding Common Stock pro rata according to the number of shares of Common Stock held by each.
holder thereof.

Notwithstanding the above, for purposes of determining the amount each holder of

shares of Preferred Stock is entitled to receive out of the Available Funds and Assets, each such holder of
shares of a series of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have converted (regardless of whether such

4 25041/00010/DOCS/2441669.6
holder actually converted) such holder’s shares of such series into shares of Common Stock immediately
prior to the event triggering the Available Funds and Assets if, as a result of an actual conversion, such
holder would receive, in the aggregate, an amount greater than the amount that would be distributed to
such holder if such holder did not convert such series of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock.
If any such holder shall be deemed to have converted shares of Preferred Stock into Common Stock
pursuant to this paragraph, then such holder shall not be entitled to receive any distribution that would
otherwise be made to holders of Preferred Stock that have not converted (or have not been deemed to
have converted) into shares of Common Stock.

3.4 Deemed Liquidation Events, Each of the following transactions (each a
“Change of Controf?’) shall be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation
as those terms are used in this Section 3: (a) any reorganization by way of share exchange, consolidation
or merger or other transaction or series of related transactions, in one transaction or series of related
transactions (each, a “combination transaction”), in which the Corporation is a constituent corporation
or is a party with another entity if, as a result of such combination transaction, the voting securities of the
Corporation that are outstanding immediately prior to the consummation of such combination transaction
(other than any such securities that are held by an “Acquiring Stockholder,” as defined below) do not
represent, or are not converted into, securities of the surviving corporation of such combination
transaction (or such surviving corporation’s parent corporation if the surviving corporation is owned by
the parent corporation) that, immediately after the consummation of such combination transaction,
together constitute at least a majority of the total voting securities of such surviving corporation (or its
parent corporation, if applicable) that are outstanding immediately after the consummation of such
combination transaction, including securities of such surviving corporation (or its parent corporation, if
applicable) that are held by the Acquiring Stockholder; or (b) a sale, conveyance, license or other
disposition of all or substantially all of the assets or business of the Corporation; or (c) any transaction in
which any shares of Preferred Stock are converted into any other property or security (other than
Common Stock of the Corporation). For the avoidance of doubt, the sale of equity securities of the
Corporation solely for the purpose of raising additional working capital in which the Corporation is the
surviving entity and which is approved by the Board (including the Preferred Directors) shall not be
deemed to be a Change of Control. For purposes of this subsection 3.4, an “Acquiring Stockholder”
means a stockholder or stockholders of the Corporation that (i) merges or combines with the Corporation
in such combination transaction or (ii) owns or controls a majority of another corporation that merges or
combines with the Corporation in such combination transaction.

3.5 Non-Cash Consideration. If any assets of the Corporation distributed to
stockholders in connection with any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation are other
than cash, then the value of such assets shall be their fair market value as determined by the Board in
good faith, except that any securities to be distributed to stockholders in a liquidation, dissolution, or
winding up of the Corporation shall be valued as follows:

(a) The method of valuation of securities not subject to investment letter or
other similar restrictions on free marketability shall be as follows:

(i) unless otherwise specified in a definitive agreement for the
acquisition of the Corporation, if the securities are then traded on a national securities exchange, then the
value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange or system
over the thirty (30) day period ending three (3) days prior to the distribution; and

(ii) if (i) above does not apply but the securities are actively traded
over-the-counter, then, unless otherwise specified in a definitive agreement for the acquisition of the

5 25041/00010/DOCS/2441669.6
Corporation, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid prices over the thirty (30)
calendar day period ending three (3) trading days prior to the distribution; and

(iii) if there is no active public market as described in clauses (i) or
(ii) above, then the value shall be the fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board.

(b) The method of valuation of securities subject to investment letter or
other restrictions on free marketability shall be to make an appropriate discount from the market value
determined as above in subparagraphs (a)(i),(ii) or (iii) of this subsection 3.5 to reflect the approximate
fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board.

(1) vote for each share thereof held.

Common Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then
outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the capital stock of the Corporation
entitled to vote thereon without a vote of the holders of the Common Stock voting as a separate class,

7 2504 1/00010/DOCS/2441669.6
5. Conversion Rights. The outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be convertible into
Common Stock as follows:

5.1 Optional Conversion.

(a) At the option of the holder thereof, each share of Preferred Stock shall
be convertible into fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as provided herein.

(b) Each holder of Preferred Stock who elects to convert the same into
shares of Common Stock shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the
office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock or Common Stock, and shall give
written notice to the Corporation at such office that such holder elects to convert the same and shall state
therein the number of shares of Preferred Stock being converted. Thereupon the Corporation shall
promptly issue and deliver at such office to such holder a certificate or certificates for the number of
shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled upon such conversion. Such conversion shall
be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of
the certificate or certificates representing the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person
entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all
purposes as the record holder of such shares of Common Stock on such date. If a conversion election
under this subsection 5.1 is made in connection with an underwritten offering of the Corporation’s
securities pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (which underwritten offering does not
cause an automatic conversion pursuant to subsection 5.2 to take place) the conversion may, at the option
of the holder tendering shares of Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with
the underwriters of the sale of the Corporation’s securities pursuant to such offering, in which event the
holders making such elections who are entitled to receive Common Stock upon conversion of their
Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such shares of Preferred Stock until immediately
prior to the closing of such sale of the Corporation’s securities in the offering.

5.2 Automatic Conversion.

(a) Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into fully
paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock, as provided herein: (i) immediately prior to the closing
of a firm commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement filed
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, covering the offer and sale of Common Stock for the
account of the Corporation in which the aggregate public offering price (before deduction of
underwriters’ discounts and commissions) equals or exceeds $25,000,000 and the public offering price
per share of which reflects a fully-diluted valuation of the Corporation immediately prior to such public
offering of at least $100,000,000; or (ii) upon the Corporation’s receipt of the written consent of the
holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding, voting
together as a single class on an as-converted basis.

(b) Upon the occurrence of any event specified in subparagraph 5.2(a)(i) or
(ii) above, the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted into Common Stock automatically
without the need for any further action. by the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates
representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its-transfer agent; provided, however, that
the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion unless the certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are either
delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent as provided below, or the holder notifies the
Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an
agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in

8 2504 1/00010/DOCS/2441669.6
connection with such certificates. Upon the occurrence of such automatic conversion of the Preferred
Stock, the holders of Preferred Stock shall surrender the certificates representing such shares at the office
of the Corporation or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock or Common Stock. Thereupon, there
shall be issued and delivered to such holder promptly at such office and in its name as shown on such
surrendered certificate or certificates, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common
Stock into which the shares of Preferred Stock surrendered were convertible on the date on which such
automatic conversion occurred.

5.3 Conversion Price. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible in
accordance with subsection 5.1 or subsection 5.2 above into the number of shares of Common Stock
which results from dividing the Original Issue Price for such series of Preferred Stock by the conversion
price for such series of Preferred Stock that is in effect at the time of conversion (the “Conversion
Price”). The initial Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock shall be the Original Issue Price
of such series of Preferred Stock. The Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock shall be subject
to adjustment from time to time as provided below. Following each adjustment of the Conversion Price,
such adjusted Conversion Price shall remain in effect until a further adjustment of such Conversion Price
hereunder.

5.4 Adjustment Upon Common Stock Event. Upon the happening of a Common
Stock Event (as hereinafter defined), the Conversion Price of each such series of Preferred Stock shall,
simultaneously with the happening of such Common Stock Event, be adjusted by multiplying the
Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such Common Stock
Event by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to such Common Stock Event, and (ii) the denominator of which shall
be the number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately after such Common Stock
Event, and the product so obtained shall thereafter be the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred
Stock. The Conversion Price for a series of Preferred Stock shall be readjusted in the same manner upon
the happening of each subsequent Common Stock Event. As used herein, the term the “Common Stock
Event’ shall mean at any time or from time to time after the Filing Date, (i) the issue by the Corporation
of additional shares of Common Stock as a dividend or other distribution on outstanding Common Stock,
(ii) a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares of Common
Stock, or (iii) a combination of the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares
of Common Stock.

5.5 Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. If at any time or from time
to time after the Filing Date the Corporation pays a dividend or makes another distribution to the holders
of the Common Stock payable in securities of the Corporation, other than an event constituting a
Common Stock Event, then in each such event provision shall be made so that the holders of the
Preferred Stock shall receive upon conversion thereof, in addition to the number of shares of Common
Stock receivable upon conversion thereof, the amount of securities of the Corporation which they would
have received had their Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event (or
such record date, as applicable) and had they thereafter, during the period from the date of such event (or
such record date, as applicable) to and including the conversion date, retained such securities receivable
- by them as aforesaid during such period, subject to all other adjustments called for during such period
under this Section 5 with respect to the rights of the holders of the Preferred ‘Stock or with respect to such -
other securities by their terms.

5.6 Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. If at any time or
from time to time after the Filing Date the Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Preferred
Stock is changed into the same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock, whether

9 25041/00010/DOCS/244 1669.6
by recapitalization, reclassification or otherwise (other than by a Common Stock Event or a stock
dividend, reorganization, merger, or consolidation provided for elsewhere in this Section 5), then in any
such event each holder of Preferred Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such stock into the
kind and amount of stock and other securities and property receivable upon such recapitalization,
reclassification or other change by holders of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such
shares of Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately prior to such recapitalization,
reclassification or change, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein or with respect to such
other securities or property by the terms thereof.

5.7 Reorganizations, Mergers and Consolidations. If at any time or from time to
time after the Filing Date there is a reorganization of the Corporation (other than a recapitalization,
subdivision, combination, reclassification or exchange of shares provided for elsewhere in this Section 5)
or a merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into another corporation (except an event which
is governed under subsection 3.4), then, as a part of such reorganization, merger or consolidation,
provision shall be made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock thereafter shall be entitled to receive,
upon conversion of the Preferred Stock, the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of
the Corporation, or of such successor corporation resulting from such reorganization, merger or
consolidation, to which a holder of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled
on such reorganization, merger or consolidation. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made
in the application of the provisions of this Section 5 with respect to the rights of the holders of the
Preferred Stock after the reorganization, merger or consolidation to the end that the provisions of this
Section 5 (including adjustment of the Conversion Price then in effect and number of shares issuable
upon conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event and be as nearly equivalent to
the provisions hereof as may be practicable. This subsection 5.7 shall similarly apply to successive
reorganizations, mergers and consolidations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 5, if any reorganization, merger or consolidation is approved by the vote of stockholders required
by Section 6 hereof, then such transaction and the rights of the holders of Preferred Stock and Common
Stock pursuant to such reorganization, merger or consolidation will be governed by the documents
entered into in connection with such transaction and not by the provisions of this subsection 5.7.

5.8 Sale of Shares Below Conversion Price.

(a) Adjustment Formula. If at any time or from time to time after the Filing
Date the Corporation issues or sells, or is deemed by the provisions of this subsection 5.8 to have issued
or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock (as hereinafter defined), otherwise than in connection with
a Common Stock Event as provided in subsection 5.4, a dividend or distribution as provided in
subsection 5.5 or a recapitalization, reclassification or other change as provided in subsection 5.6, or a
reorganization, merger or consolidation as provided in subsection 5.7, for an Effective Price (as
hereinafter defined) that is less than the Conversion Price for a series of Preferred Stock in effect
immediately prior to such issue or sale (or deemed issue or sale), then, and in each such case, the
Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock shall be reduced, as of the close of business on the
date of such issue or sale, to the price obtained by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction:

(i) The numerator of which shall be the sum of (A) the number of
Common Stock Equivalents Outstanding (as hereinafter defined) immediately prior to such issue
or sale (actual or deemed) of Additional Shares of Common Stock plus (B) the quotient obtained
by dividing the Aggregate Consideration Received (as hereinafter defined) by the Corporation
for the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued or sold (or deemed so
issued and sold) by the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately
prior to such issue or sale (actual or deemed); and

10 2504 1/00010/DOCS/2441669.6
(ii) The denominator of which shall be the sum of (A) the number of
Common Stock Equivalents Outstariding immediately prior to such issue or sale plus (B) the
number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued or sold (or deemed so issued and sold).

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, following the Original Issue Date, adjustment pursuant
to this subsection 5.8 to the Conversion Price of the Series A Preferred Stock and/or Series B Preferred
Stock shall only be made if the Corporation issues or sells, or is deemed by the provisions of this
subsection 5.8 to have issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock for an Effective Price that is
less than the Conversion Price for the Series C Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such issue
or sale (or deemed issue or sale), otherwise than in connection with a Common Stock Event as provided
in subsection 5.4, a dividend or distribution as provided in subsection 5.5 or a recapitalization,
reclassification or other change as provided in subsection 5.6, or a reorganization, merger or
consolidation as provided in subsection 5.7.

(b) Certain Definitions. For the purpose of making any adjustment required
under this subsection 5.8:

(i) The “Additional Shares of Common Stock” shall mean all
shares of Common Stock issued by the Corporation, or deemed issued as provided in subsection 5.8(c)
below, whether or not subsequently reacquired or retired by the Corporation, other than:

such other corporation or entity or fifty percent (50%) or more of the voting power of such other

transaction described in subsection 5.4 hereof and which issuance is approved by the Board, provided
that the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock has been adjusted in accordance with
subsection 5.4 in connection therewith;

(G) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable in a public
offering prior to or in connection with which all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock will be converted
to Common Stock; and

(A) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable with the
written consent of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding Preferred Stock.

(ii) The “Aggregate Consideration Received” by the Corporation
for any issue or sale (or deemed issue or sale) of securities shall (A) to the extent it consists of cash, be
computed at the gross amount of cash received by the Corporation before deduction of any underwriting
or similar commissions, compensation or concessions paid or allowed by the Corporation in connection
with such issue or sale and without deduction of any expenses payable by the Corporation; (B) to the
extent it consists of property other than cash, be computed at the fair value of that property as determined
in good faith by the Board; and (C) if Additional Shares of Common Stock, Convertible Securities or
Rights or Options to purchase either Additional Shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities are
issued or sold together with other stock or securities or other assets of the Corporation for a consideration
which covers both, be computed as the portion of the consideration so received that may be reasonably
determined in good faith by the Board to be allocable to such Additional Shares of Common Stock,
Convertible Securities or Rights or Options.

(iii) | The “Common Stock Equivalents Outstanding” shall mean the
number of shares of Common Stock that is equal to the sum of (A) all shares of Common Stock of the
Corporation that are outstanding at the time in question, plus (B) all shares of Common Stock of the
Corporation issuable upon conversion of all shares of Preferred Stock or other Convertible Securities that
are outstanding at the time in question, plus (C) all shares of Common Stock of the Corporation that are

securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock.

(v) The “Effective Price” of Additional Shares of Common Stock

subsection 5.8, for the issue of such Additional Shares of Common Stock; and

(vi) The “Rights or Options” shall mean warrants, options or other
rights to purchase or acquire shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities.

(c) Deemed Issuances. For the purpose of making any adjustment to the
Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock required under this subsection 5.8, if the Corporation
issues or sells any Rights or Options or Convertible Securities and if the Effective Price of the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Rights or Options and/or the conversion or exchange of
Convertible Securities (computed without reference to any additional or similar protective or antidilution

12 2504 1/00010/DOCS/244 1669.6
clauses) is less than the Conversion Price then in effect for a series of Preferred Stock, then the
Corporation shall be deemed to have issued (each a “Deemed Issuance’), at the time of the issuance of
such Rights or Options or Convertible Securities, that number of Additional Shares of Common Stock
that is equal to the maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise or conversion
of such Rights or Options or Convertible Securities upon their issuance and to have received, as the
Aggregate Consideration Received for the issuance of such shares, an amount equal to the total amount
of the consideration, if any, received by the Corporation for the issuance of such Rights or Options or
Convertible Securities, plus, in the case of such Rights or Options, the minimum amounts of
consideration, if any, payable to the Corporation upon the exercise in full of such Rights or Options, plus,
in the case of Convertible Securities, the minimum amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the
Corporation (other than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible
Securities) upon the conversion or exchange thereof}, provided that:

(i) if the minimum amounts of such consideration cannot be
ascertained in such Deemed Issuance, but are a function of antidilution or similar protective clauses, then
the Corporation shall be deemed to have received the minimum amounts of consideration without
reference to such clauses;

(ii) if the minimum amount of consideration payable to the
Corporation upon the exercise of Rights or Options or the conversion or exchange of Convertible
Securities is reduced over time or upon the occurrence or non-occurrence of specified events other than
by reason of antidilution or similar protective adjustments, then the Effective Price shall be recalculated
using the figure to which such minimum amount of consideration is reduced; and

(iii) if the minimum amount of consideration payable to the
Corporation upon the exercise of such Rights or Options or the conversion or exchange of Convertible
Securities is subsequently increased, then the Effective Price shall again be recalculated using the
increased minimum amount of consideration payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such Rights
or Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities.

No further adjustment of the Conversion Price, adjusted upon the Deemed Issuance of such Rights or
Options or Convertible Securities, shall be made as a result of the actual issuance of shares of Common
Stock on the exercise of any such Rights or Options or the conversion or exchange of any such
Convertible Securities. If any such Rights or Options or the conversion rights represented by any such
Convertible Securities shall expire without having been fully exercised, then the Conversion Price as
adjusted upon the issuance of such Rights or Options or Convertible Securities shall be readjusted to the
Conversion Price which would have been in effect had an adjustment been made on the basis that the
only shares of Common Stock so issued were the shares of Common Stock, if any, that were actually
issued or sold on the exercise of such Rights or Options or rights of conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities, and such shares of Common Stock, if any, were issued or sold for the
consideration actually received by the Corporation upon such exercise, plus the consideration, if any,
actually received by the Corporation for the granting of all such Rights or Options, whether or not
exercised, plus the consideration received for issuing or selling all such Convertible Securities actually
converted or exchanged, plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the Corporation (other than
by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities) on the conversion
or exchange of such Convertible Securities, provided that such readjustment shall not apply to prior
conversions of Preferred Stock.

5.9 Certificate of Adjustment. In each case of an adjustment or readjustment of the
Conversion Price for a series of Preferred: Stock, the Corporation, at its expense, shall cause its Chief.

13 25041/00010/DOCS/244 1669.6
Financial Officer to compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the provisions hereof
and prepare a certificate showing such adjustment or readjustment, and shall promptly mail such
certificate, by first class mail, postage prepaid, to each registered holder of the Preferred Stock at the
holder’s address as shown in the Corporation’s books.

5.10 Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon
any conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional share to which the holder would otherwise be
entitled, the Corporation shall pay the holder cash equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by the
Common Stock’s fair market value as determined in good faith by the Board as of the date of conversion.

5.11 Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at all
times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock, solely for
the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock, such number of its shares of
Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares
of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock
shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, the
Corporation will promptly take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary
to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be
sufficient for such purpose.

5.12 Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Certificate of
Incorporation to be given to the holders of shares of the Preferred Stock shall be deemed given upon the
earlier of actual receipt or five (5) business days after deposit in the United States mail, by certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or delivery by a recognized express courier,
fees prepaid, addressed to each holder of record at the address of such holder appearing on the books of
the Corporation.

6. Restrictions and Limitations.

the Delaware General Corporation Law, as so amended.

The Corporation shall indemnify to the fullest extent permitted by law any person made or
threatened to be made a party to an action or proceeding whether criminal, civil, administrative or

partner or employee of the Fund and that may be a corporate opportunity for both the Corporation and
such Fund, such director shall to the fullest extent permitted by law have fully satisfied and fulfilled his
fiduciary duty to the Corporation and its stockholders with respect to such corporate opportunity, and the
Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by law waives any claim that such business opportunity

16 25041/0001 0/DOCS/2441669.6
constituted a corporate opportunity that should have been presented to the Corporation or any of its
affiliates, if such director acts in good faith in a manner consistent with the following policy: a corporate
opportunity offered to any person who is a director of the Corporation, and who is also a partner or
employee of a Fund shall belong to such Fund, unless such opportunity was expressly offered to such
