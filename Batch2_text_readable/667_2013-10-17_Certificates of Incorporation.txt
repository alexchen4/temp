3. Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as
follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert; Conversion Price. Each share of Preferred Stock shall
be convertible, without the payment of any additional consideration by the holder thereof and at
the option of the holder thereof, at any time or from time to time after the date of issuance of
such share, at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, into
such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by
dividing the Purchase Price (as hereinafter defined) by the Conversion Price (as hereinafter
defined) in effect for the relevant series of Preferred Stock at the time of conversion.

(i) The “Purchase Price” shall mean (i) with respect to the Series A
Preferred Stock, $6.67 per share, (ii) with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock, $3.33 per
share, (iti) with respect to the Series C Preferred Stock, $7.50 per share, (iv) with respect to the
Series D Preferred Stock, $7.50 per share, (v) with respect to the Series E Preferred Stock, $6.25

respect to the Series G Preferred Stock, $5.11 per share (the “Series G Purchase Price”),

(ii) The “Conversion Price” shall initially mean (i) with respect to the
Series A Preferred Stock, $6.25 per share, (ii) with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock, $3.33
per share, (iii) with respect to the Series C Preferred Stock, $6.25 per share, (iv) with respect to

with respect to the Series G Preferred Stock, $5.11 per share. The Conversion Price shall be
subject to adjustment as herein provided.

(iii) | Any holder of Preferred Stock may exercise the conversion right
pursuant to this Section 3(a) by delivering to the Corporation the certificate or certificates for the
shares to be converted (or, if such registered holder alleges that such certificate has been lost,

B4180472.2
stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to the
Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made against the
Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate), at the office
of the transfer agent for the Preferred Stock (or at the principal office of the Corporation if the
Corporation serves as its own transfer agent), duly endorsed for transfer or with duly executed
stock transfer powers sufficient to permit transfer attached, accompanied by written notice
stating that the holder elects to convert such shares and stating the name or names (with address)
in which the certificate or certificates for the shares of Common Stock are to be issued.
Conversion shall be deemed to have been effected on the date when such delivery is made (the
“Conversion Date”). As promptly as practicable thereafter, the Corporation shall issue and
deliver to or upon the written order of such holder, to the place designated by such holder, a
certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled, and a cash amount in respect of any fractional interest in a share of Common Stock as
provided in Section 3(b) below. The person in whose name the certificate or certificates for
Common Stock are to be issued shall be deemed to have become a stockholder of record on the
applicable Conversion Date unless the transfer books of the Corporation are closed on that date,
in which event such person shall be deemed to have become a stockholder of record on the next
succeeding date on which the transfer books are open, but the Conversion Price for such
Preferred Stock shall be that in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the
Conversion Date. Upon conversion of only a portion of the number of shares covered by a
certificate representing shares of the Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion, the Corporation
shail issue and deliver to or upon the written order of the holder of the certificate so surrendered
for conversion, at the expense of the Corporation, a new certificate covering the number of
shares of such series of Preferred Stock representing the unconverted portion of the certificate so
surrendered.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically
be converted into shares of Common Stock at the then effective applicable Conversion Price,
upon (i) the written election of the Required Holders (an “Automatic Conversion Election”) or
(ii) the closing of an underwritten public offering of Common Stock pursuant to an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, with aggregate net proceeds
to the Corporation from such offering (before underwriters discounts and commissions) of not
less than $25,000,000 (a “Qualified Public Offering”). In the event of a Qualified Public
Offering, the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of
the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted their Preferred Stock until the closing
of the Qualified Public Offering.

Upon the effective date of an Automatic Conversion Election or the closing of the
Qualified Public Offering, all shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically without
any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates representing
such shares arc surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent, and thereafter the holders of
such shares shall be deemed to be the holders of that number of shares of Common Stock into
which such Preferred Stock shall have been so converted and such certificates shall thereafter be
deemed to represent such number of shares of Common Stock; provided, however, that the
Corporation shall! not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion unless certificates evidencing such shares of the Preferred Stock
are either delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent, or the holder of such shares notifies

1341804722
the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen, or destroyed and
executes an agreement reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation
from any loss incurred by it in connection therewith. Upon the automatic conversion of the
Preferred Stock, the holders of such Preferred Stock may surrender the certificates representing
such shares at the office of the Corporation or of its transfer agent. Thereupon, there shall be
issued and delivered to such holder, promptly at such office and in such holder’s name as shown
on such surrendered certificate or certificates, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares
of Common Stock into which the shares of the Preferred Stock surrendered were convertible on
the date on which such automatic conversion occurred. No fractional shares of Common Stock
shall be issued upon conversion of the Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which
the holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction
multiplied by the fair market value of a share of Common Stock as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors of the Corporation. Whether or not fractional shares would be issuable
upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Preferred
Stock the holder is at the time converting into Common Stock and the aggregate number of
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion.

(c) Adjustments to Conversion Price for Each Series of Preferred Stock for
Diluting Issues.

financing to the Corporation on substantially the same terms, including any terms related to such
Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities).

(ii) | No Adjustment of Conversion Price. No adjustment in the number
of shares of Common Stock into which any series of Preferred Stock is convertible shall be
made, by adjustment in the applicable Conversion Price, in respect of the issuance of Additional
Shares of Common Stock or otherwise, unless the consideration per share for an Additional
Share of Common Stock issued or deemed to be issued by the Corporation is less than the
applicable Conversion Price in effect on the date of, and immediately prior to, the issuance or
deemed issuance of such Additional Share of Common Stock.

(ili) Issue or Sale of Securities Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of
Common Stock.

Common Stock would be less than the applicable Conversion Price in effect on the date of and
immediately prior to such issue or sale or such record date, as the case may be, and provided
further that in any such case in which Additional Shares of Common Stock are deemed to be
issued:

(A) no further adjustment in the applicable Conversion
Price shal] be made upon the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities or shares of Common
Stock upon the exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities;

(B) if such Options or Convertible Securities by their
terms provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any change in the consideration payable
to the Corporation, or change in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable, upon the
exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, the applicable Conversion Price computed upon the
original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and any
subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon any such change becoming effective, be
recomputed to reflect such change insofar as it affects such Options or the rights of conversion or
exchange under such Convertible Securities;

(C) upon the expiration of any such Options or any
rights of conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have been
exercised, the applicable Conversion Price computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon the
occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon,
shall, upon such expiration, be recomputed as if:

(I) In the case of Convertible Securities or

actually received by the Corporation for the issue of all such Options, whether or not exercised,
plus the consideration deemed to have been received by the Corporation (determined pursuant to
Section B,3(c)(v)) upon the issue of the Convertible Securities with respect to which such
Options were actually exercised;

such adjustment shall be made in the same manner provided in clause (C) above; and

(E) if such record date shall have been fixed and such
Options or Convertible Securities are not issued on the date fixed therefor, the adjustment
previously made in the applicable Conversion Price, as the case may be, which became effective
on such record date shall be cancelled as of the close of business on such record date, and
thereafter the applicable Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this Section B.3({c)(iii) as

the event the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall
declare or pay any dividend or make any other distribution on the Common Stock payable in
Common Stock or effect a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by
