The following is a statement of the designations and the powers, preferences and rights,
and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof in respect of each class of stock of the
Corporation.

A. COMMON STOCK.

(1) Dividend Rights. Dividends may be declared and paid on the Common
Stock from funds legally available therefor as and when determined by the Board of Directors,
subject in all cases to the rights and preferences of the holders of the Preferred Stock.

(2) Liquidation Rights. Subject to the rights and preferences of the holders of
the Preferred Stock, upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of
the affairs of the Corporation, the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive all assets
of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders.

(3) Noting Rights. The holders of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled
to one vote for each share so held, and shall be entitled to notice of any stockholders’ meeting
and to vote upon such matters as provided in the By-Laws of the Corporation, and as may be
provided by law. Holders of Common Stock shall not be entitled to cumulate their votes for any
purpose. The number of authorized shares of Common Stock may be increased or decreased (but
not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of
a majority of the outstanding capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote, irrespective of the
provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.

B. PREFERRED STOCK.
The Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series.
C. SERIES A CONVERTIBLE PARTICIPATING PREFERRED STOCK.

(1) Designation of Series. Two Million One Hundred Thousand (2,100,000)
shares of the authorized Preferred Stock are hereby designated as Series A Convertible
Participating Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred Stock”).

(2) Rights, Preferences and Restrictions of Series A Preferred Stock. The

Series A Preferred Stock shall have the following rights, qualifications, preferences, powers,
privileges and restrictions and limitations.

(a) Dividend Rights. If any dividend is declared on the Common
Stock or any other class or series of capital stock of the Corporation ranking in liquidation junior
to that of the Series A Preferred Stock (payable other than in Common Stock or other securities
and rights convertible into or entitling the holder thereof to receive, directly or indirectly,
additional shares of Common Stock of this Corporation), prior and in preference to the payment
of any such dividend a cash dividend shall be declared and paid, out of funds legally available
therefor, on the Series A Preferred Stock in an amount per share that is equal to or greater than
the per share amount that would have been payable to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock
had such holders converted their Series A Preferred Stock into Common Stock pursuant to

-2-

BST99 1517894-1.076263.0010
subsection (c) below.

(b) Liquidation Preference.

(1) Unless otherwise approved by the holders of a majority in
interest in the Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding, in the event of any (i) voluntary or
involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation (a “Corporate Event”),

(ii) any merger or consolidation of one or more persons into or with the Corporation, any merger
or consolidation of the Corporation into or with one or more persons, or any stock sale, tender
offer, other business combination or series of related transactions, if the stockholders of the
Corporation immediately prior to such transaction or transactions do not retain at least a majority
of the voting power of the surviving entity, as measured immediately after the close of any such
transaction, or (iii) the sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer to another person, in a single
transaction or series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Corporation (each of (i), (ii) and (iii), a “Liquidation Event”), the holders of the Series A
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, in preference to the holders of the Common Stock, a
per share amount equal to the original purchase price paid for the Series A Preferred Stock (the
“Series A Issue Price”), plus any declared but unpaid dividends thereon (the “Series A
Liquidation Amount”). If the funds available upon liquidation are insufficient to satisfy in full
the Series A Liquidation Amount, the entire assets of the Corporation available for such
distribution shall be allocated to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, ratably among the
holders in proportion to the Series A Liquidation Amount each such holder would otherwise be
entitled to receive. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction shall not constitute a
Liquidation Event if its sole purpose is to change the state of the Corporation’s incorporation or
to create a holding company that will be owned in substantially the same proportions by the
persons who held the Corporation’s securities immediately prior to such transaction.

(2) After the payment of the full Series A Liquidation Amount
to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, or funds necessary for such payment shall have
been set aside by the Corporation in trust for the account of holders of Series A Preferred Stock
so as to be available for such payment, the remaining assets shall be distributed ratably to the
holders of Common Stock and Series A Preferred Stock in proportion to the number of shares of
Common Stock then held by each holder or issuable to each holder upon conversion of the Series
A Preferred Stock then held by each holder to Common Stock.

(3) The Corporation shall give each holder of record of Series
A Preferred Stock written notice of an impending transaction described in this subsection C(2)(b)
not later than twenty (20) days prior to the stockholders’ meeting called to approve such
transaction or circulation of a written consent in lieu thereof. The notice shall describe the
material terms and conditions of the impending transaction and the provisions of this subsection
C(2)(b), and the Corporation shall thereafter give such holders prompt notice of any material
changes to such terms and conditions. The transaction shall in no event take place sooner than
twenty-five (25) days after the Corporation has given the notice provided for herein or sooner
than ten (10) days after the Corporation has given notice of any material changes to such terms
and conditions; provided, however, that such periods may be shortened upon the written consent

-3-
BST99 1517894-1.076263.0010
of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock.

The provisions of this subsection C(2)(b) are in addition to the protective provisions of
subsection C(2)(f) below.

In the event of a deemed Liquidation Event pursuant to this subsection C(2)(b), if any
portion of the consideration payable to the stockholders of the Corporation is placed into escrow
and/or is payable to the stockholders of the Corporation subject to contingencies, the merger
agreement shall provide that (a) the portion of such consideration that is not placed in escrow and
not subject to any contingencies (the “Initial Consideration”) shall be allocated among the
holders of capital stock of the Corporation in accordance with subsections C(2)(b)(1) and
C(2)(b)(2) as if the Initial Consideration were the only consideration payable in connection with
such deemed Liquidation Event and (b) any additional consideration which becomes payable to
the stockholders of the Corporation upon release from escrow or satisfaction of contingencies
shall be allocated among the holders of capital stock of the Corporation in accordance with
subsections C(2)(b)(1) and C(2)(b)(2) after taking into account the previous payment of the
Initial Consideration as part of the same transaction.

(c) Conversion. The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall
have conversion rights as follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

(1) Right to Convert. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock
shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of
such share, at the office of the Corporation or a transfer agent for the Series A Preferred Stock, as
the case may be, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is
determined by dividing the Series A Issue Price by the Series A Conversion Price then in effect.
The “Series A Conversion Price” shall be the Series A Issue Price, subject to adjustment as set
forth in subsection C(2)(c)(4) below.

(2) Mandatory Conversion. Each share of Series A Preferred
Stock shall automatically be converted into such number of shares of Common Stock as is
determined by dividing the Series A Issue Price by the Series A Conversion Price then in effect,
without further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates
representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent, upon the first to
occur of: (i) the consummation of a firm commitment registered public offering of the
Corporation’s Common Stock at a price per share of not less than five (5) times the Series A
Issue Price and resulting in gross proceeds to the Corporation of not less than Thirty Million
Dollars ($30,000,000), prior to deduction of underwriter’s commissions and expenses (a
“Qualified Public Offering”); or (ii) the affirmative written consent of holders of not less than
sixty-seven percent (67%) of the Series A Preferred Stock at the time outstanding.

(3) Mechanics of Conversion; Fractional Shares; Dividends.
Before any holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into shares of
Common Stock pursuant to C(2)(c)(1) hereof, such holder shall surrender the certificate or
certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of a transfer agent for the
Series A Preferred Stock, as the case may be, and shall give written notice by mail, postage
prepaid, to the Corporation at its principal corporate office, of the election to convert the same
and shall state therein the name or names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of

4.
BST99 1517894-1.076263.0010
Common Stock are to be issued. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue
and deliver at such office to such holder, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a
certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall
be entitled. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close
of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be
converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable
upon such conversion shail be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such
shares of Common Stock as of such date. Upon conversion of only a portion of the number of
shares of Series A Preferred Stock represented by a certificate surrendered for conversion, the
Corporation shall issue and deliver to the holder of such certificate, a new certificate for the
number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock not converted. No fractional shares shall be issued
upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock. Whether or not fractional shares are issuable
upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Series A
Preferred Stock the holder is at the time converting into Common Stock and the number of shares
of Common Stock issuable upon such aggregate conversion. In lieu of fractional shares to which
the holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay such holder a cash amount
equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair market value of a share of the Common Stock, as
reasonably determined by the Board of Directors. On the date on which shares of Series A
Preferred Stock are deemed to be converted pursuant to this subsection C(2)(c)(3), the
Corporation shall deliver to each holder converting shares of Series A Preferred Stock additional
shares of Common Stock in an amount equal to the accrued but unpaid dividends as of such date.
divided by the Series A Issue Price.

(4) Adjustments to Series A Conversion Price.

(a) Issue of Additional Stock. Upon each issuance or
sale (or deemed issuance or sale) by the Corporation of any Additional Stock (as defined in
subsection C(2)(c)(4)(e) below) without consideration, or for a consideration per share less than
the Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional
Stock, the Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to each such issuance or sale
shall, upon such issuance or sale, be reduced to a price determined by multiplying such Series A
Conversion Price by a fraction (i) the numerator of which shall be (x) the number of shares of
Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance or sale, plus (y) the number of
shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for the
total number of shares of Additional Stock so issued or sold (or deemed issued or sold) would
purchase at the Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale,
and (ii) the denominator of which shall be (x) the number of shares of Preferred Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such issuance or sale, plus (y) the number of shares of such
Additional Stock so issued or sold (or deemed issued or sold).

(b) No Adjustment of Series A Conversion Price. No
adjustment of the Series A Conversion Price shall be made in an amount less than one cent per

share; provided, that any adjustments which are not required to be made by reason of this
subsection shal! be carried forward and shall be taken into account in any subsequent adjustment
which together with any adjustment being carried forward shall amount to one cent or more per
share. Except to the limited extent provided for in subsections C(2)(c)(4)(d)(iii) and

5-

BST99 1517894-1.076263.0010
C(2)(c)(4)(dXiv), no adjustment of the Series A Conversion Price pursuant to this subsection
C(2)(c)(4) shall have the effect of increasing the Series A Conversion Price above the Series A
Conversion Price at the time in effect.

(c) Determination of Consideration.

(i) In the case of the issuance or sale (or
deemed issuance or sale) of Additional Stock or options, rights or securities referred to in
subsection C(2)(c)(4)(d) below for cash, the consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of
cash paid therefor before deducting any discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid
or incurred by the Corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance
and sale (or deemed issuance or sale) thereof.

(ii) | In the case of the issuance or sale (or
deemed issuance or sale) of Additional Stock or options, rights or securities referred to in
subsection C(2)(c)(4)(d) below for a consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the
consideration other than cash shall be deemed to be the fair value thereof as reasonably
determined by a majority of the Board of Directors.

(d) Deemed Issuances of Common Stock. In the case
of the issuance (whether before, on or after the date hereof) of options, warrants or other rights to
purchase or subscribe for Common Stock (all such options, warrants or rights being hereinafter
referred to as “Options”), securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for Common
Stock (all such convertible or exchangeable securities being hereinafter referred to as
“Convertible Securities”), or options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or
exchangeable securities (which are not excluded from the definition of Additional Stock), the
following provisions shall apply:

(i) The aggregate maximum number of shares
of Common Stock deliverable upon exercise of such Options shall be deemed to have been
issued at the time such Options were issued (whether or not such Options are then exercisable)
and for a consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in
subsection C(2)(c)(4)(c) above), if any, received or receivable by the Corporation upon the
issuance of such Options plus the minimum additional aggregate consideration, if any, payable to
the Corporation upon the exercise of all such Options.

(ii) | The aggregate maximum number of shares
of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of or in exchange for any such Convertible
Securities or upon the exercise of options for such Convertible Securities and subsequent
conversion or exchange thereof shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such Convertible
Securities were issued or such options were issued (whether or not such Convertible Securities
are then convertible or exchangeable or such options are then exercisable) and for a consideration
equal to the consideration, if any, received or receivable by the Corporation upon the sale or
issuance of any such Convertible Securities and related options (excluding any cash received on
account of accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the minimum additional aggregate
consideration, if any, payable to the Corporation upon the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities or the exercise of any related options (the consideration in each case to be

-6-

BST99 1517894-1.076263.0010
determined in the manner provided in subsection C(2)(c)(4)(c) above).

(iit) ‘In the event of any change in the number of
shares of Common Stock deliverable or any increase in the consideration payable to the
Corporation upon exercise of such Options, or upon conversion of or in exchange for such
Convertible Securities or options for such Convertible Securities, any Series A Conversion Price
obtained with respect to the adjustment which was made upon the issuance of such Options,
Convertible Securities or options for such Convertible Securities, and any subsequent
adjustments based thereon, shal] be recomputed to reflect such change, but no further adjustment
shall be made for the actual issuance of Common Stock or any payment of such consideration
upon the exercise of any such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities or the exercise of options for such Convertible Securities.

(iv) | Upon the expiration of any such Options, the
termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options or rights
related to such Convertible Securities, any Series A Conversion Price obtained with respect to the
adjustment which was made upon the issuance of such Options or Convertible Securities or
options related to such Convertible Securities, and any subsequent adjustments based thereon,
shall be recomputed to reflect the issuance of only the number of shares of Common Stock
actually issued upon the exercise of such Options, upon the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities or upon the exercise of the options related to such Convertible Securities.

(e) Definition of Additional Stock. For purpose of this
subsection C(2)(c)(4), ‘Additional Stock” shall mean any shares of Common Stock issued (or
deemed to have been issued pursuant to subsection C(2)(c)(4)(d) above) by the Corporation after
the date shares of Series A Preferred Stock were first issued (the “Purchase Date’’) other than:

(i) Common Stock or Common Stock
Equivalents issued pursuant to a transaction described in subsection C(2)(c)(5) below;

(ii) | Common Stock (the “Reserved Incentive
Shares”) issuable or issued to employees, officers, directors, or consultants of the Corporation

agreement (as appropriately adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends and the like), approved by a
majority of the Directors of the Corporation, including the affirmative vote of the Series A
Preferred Director (hereinafter defined);

(iii) | Common Stock issued or issuable upon
conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock;

(iv) | Common Stock or Preferred Stock (or
options or warrants to purchase or securities convertible or exercisable for any class of Common

consolidation, acquisition or similar business combination, in each case approved by a majority
of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, including the affirmative vote of the Series A
Preferred Director;

-7-
BST99 1517894-1.076263.0010
(Vv) Common Stock or Preferred Stock (or
options or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible or exercisable for, any class of
Common Stock or Preferred Stock) issued pursuant to any equipment leasing or loan
arrangement, or debt financing from a bank or similar financial or lending institution; provided
that each such arrangement or agreement and issuance of shares therein is (A) for other than
primarily equity financing purposes and (B) approved by a majority of the Board of Directors of
the Corporation, including the affirmative vote of the Series A Preferred Director;

(vi) | Common Stock or Preferred Stock (or
options or warrants to purchase or securities convertible or exercisable for any class of Common
or Preferred Stock) issued in connection with strategic transactions involving the Corporation
and other entities, including (A) joint ventures, manufacturing, marketing or distribution
arrangements and (B) technology transfer or development arrangements; provided that each such
strategic transaction and issuance of shares therein is (Y) for other than primarily equity
financing purposes and (Z) approved by the Corporation’s Board of Directors, including the
affirmative vote of the Series A Preferred Director.

(5) Stock Splits, Subdivisions and Dividends. In the event the
Corporation shall at any time or from time to time after the Purchase Date, fix a record date for

the effectuation of a split or subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or the
determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution
payable in additional shares of Common Stock or other securities or rights convertible into, or
entitling the holder thereof to receive directly or indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock
(hereinafter referred to as “Common Stock Equivalents”) without payment of any consideration
by such holder for the additional shares of Common Stock or the Common Stock Equivalents
(including without payment for the additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion
or exercise thereof) then, as of such record date (or the date of such dividend distribution, split or
subdivision if no record date is fixed), the Series A Conversion Price shall be appropriately
decreased so that the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall receive, upon the conversion
thereof, the number of shares of Common Stock they would have received if they had converted
their shares of Series A Preferred Stock into Common Stock immediately prior to the occurrence
of such event.

(6) Combinations or Consolidations. In the event that the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any time after the Purchase Date is decreased
by a combination, reclassification or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock
then, on the effective date of such event, the Series A Conversion Price shall be appropriately
increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of
Series A Preferred Stock shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in the number of

outstanding shares.

(7) Other Distributions. In the event that the Corporation shall!
declare a distribution payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by
the Corporation or other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not
referred to in subsection C(2)(c)(5) above, then, in each such case for the purpose of this
subsection C(2)(c)(7), the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a
proportionate share of any such distribution as though they were the holders of the number of

-8-
BST99 1517894-1.076263.0010
shares of Common Stock of the Corporation into which their shares of Series A Preferred Stock
are convertible as of the record date fixed for the determination of the holders of Common Stock
of the Corporation entitled to receive such distribution or the date of such distribution, if no
record date is fixed.

(8) Recapitalizations. If at any time or from time to time there
shall be a recapitalization of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision, combination or
merger or sale of assets transaction provided for elsewhere in this subsection C(2)(c)), provision
shall be made so that the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to
receive, upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, the number of shares of stock or other
securities or property of the Corporation or otherwise, which they would have been entitled to
receive if they had converted their shares of Series A Preferred Stock immediately prior to such
recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the
provisions of this subsection C(2){c) with respect to the rights of the holders of the Series A
Preferred Stock after the recapitalization to the end that the provisions of this subsection C(2)(c)
(including adjustment of the Series A Conversion Price then in effect and the number of shares
issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event as
nearly equivalent as may be practicable.

(9) No Impairment. The Corporation will not, by amendment
of this Certificate of Incorporation or through any reorganization, recapitalization, transfer of
assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issuance or sale of securities or any other voluntary
action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any terms to be observed or
performed hereunder by the Corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying
out of all the provisions of this subsection C(2)(c) and in the taking of all such action as may be
necessary or appropriate in order to protect the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock against
impairment of the rights of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock under this subsection C(2)(c).

(10) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each
adjustment or readjustment of the Series A Conversion Price pursuant to this subsection C(2)(c),
the Corporation, at its expense, shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in
accordance with the terms hereof and prepare and furnish to each holder of the Series A Preferred
Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts
upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon the written
request at any time of any holder of Series A Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to
such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) any such adjustment or readjustment with respect to
such series, (ii) the Series A Conversion Price at the time in effect, and (iii) the number of shares
of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received
upon the conversion of a share of Series A Preferred Stock.

(11) Notices of Record Date. In the event of any taking by the
Corporation of a record of the holders of any class or series of securities for the purpose of
determining the holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash
dividend) or other distribution, any right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any
shares of stock of any class or any other securities or property, or to receive any other right, the
Corporation shall mail to each holder of Series A Preferred Stock, at least twenty (20) days prior
to the date specified therein, a notice specifying the date on which any such record is to be taken

-9-

BST99 1517894-1.076263.0010
for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or right, and the amount and character of such
dividend, distribution or right.

(12) Reservation of Common Stock. The Corporation shall at
all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock,
solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock,
such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock; and if at any time the
number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, in addition to such
other remedies as shall be available to the holders of such Series A Preferred Stock, the
Corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to
increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall
be sufficient for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain
the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to the Corporation's Certificate of
Incorporation.

(13) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this
subsection C(2)(c) to be given to the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be
deemed effectively given upon receipt by the party by means of personal delivery, courier service
delivery, electronic mail or five (5) days after deposit with the United States Postal Service, by
registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to the Corporation.

(d) Redemption.

(1) At any time on or after the fifth anniversary of the Effective
Time, the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock may
require the Corporation, to the extent it may lawfully do so, to redeem all of the Series A
Preferred Stock in three (3) equal annual installments (each date thereof a ‘‘Series A Redemption
Date”). To exercise their rights of redemption provided in this subsection C(2)(d), the holders of
at least a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall deliver to the
Corporation a written notice (the “Series A Redemption Notice”) informing the Corporation of
the exercise of the redemption rights by the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and
specifying the first Series A Redemption Date, which shall be a business day at least twenty (20)
days subsequent to the date of the Series A Redemption Notice. At each Series A Redemption
Date, the Corporation shall redeem the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock specified
below by paying in cash therefor a sum equal to the greater of (A) the Series A Issue Price per
share (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like
after the filing date hereof) plus any declared but unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred
Stock, or (B) the fair market value per share of the Series A Preferred Stock (as determined
mutually by the Board of Directors and the holders of a majority of the shares of Series A
Preferred Stock), or with respect to any holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock that is a
Smal] Business Investment Company, such lesser amount as may be required by the Small
Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended and the rules and regulations thereunder. The total
amount to be paid for the Series A Preferred Stock is hereinafter referred to as the “Series A
Redemption Price.” The number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock that the Corporation shall
be required to redeem on any one Series A Redemption Date shall be equal to the amount

-10-

BST99 1517894-1.076263.0010
determined by dividing (x) the aggregate number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such Series A Redemption Date by (y) the number of remaining
Series A Redemption Dates (including the Series A Redemption Date to which such calculation
applies). Shares subject to redemption pursuant to this subsection C(2)(d) shall be redeemed
from each holder of Series A Preferred Stock on a pro rata basis.

(2) At least fifteen (15) days but no more than sixty (60) days
prior to the first Series A Redemption Date, the Corporation shall send a notice (a “Corporation
Redemption Notice”) to each holder of Series A Preferred Stock setting forth (A) the aggregate
Series A Redemption Price payable for the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed
from such holder, (B) the manner in which such holder shall surrender to the Corporation such
holder’s certificate(s) representing the Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed and (C) the place
at which such holder may obtain payment of such holder’s portion of the Series A Redemption
Price upon surrender of such holder’s share certificate(s). If the Corporation does not have
sufficient funds legally available to redeem al] shares to be redeemed on the Series A
Redemption Date, then the Corporation shall apply the maximum amount of funds legally
available for such purpose to redeem such shares of Series A Preferred Stock, ratably from the
holders of Series A Preferred Stock, according to the respective amounts that would be payable
to each such holder with respect to the full number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock owned
by such holder, if all such shares of Series A Preferred Stock required to be redeemed on such
Series A Redemption Date were redeemed. At any time thereafter when funds of the Corporation
