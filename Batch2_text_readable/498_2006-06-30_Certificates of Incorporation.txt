shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the
Corporation or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, and shall give wntten notice to the
Corporation at such office that such holder elects to convert the same. Such notice shall state the
number of shares of Preferred Stock being converted. Thereupon, the Corporation shall
promptly issue and deliver at such office to such holder a certificate or certificates for the
number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled and shall promptly pay (i) at
the election of such holder of Preferred Stock either in cash or in Common Stock (at the
Common Stock’s fair market value determined by the Board of Directors as of the date of such
conversion) any declared and unpaid dividends on the shares of Preferred Stock being converted;
provided, however, if such holder elects cash and there are not sufficient funds available to pay
cash to such holder, then to the extent sufficient funds are not then legally available therefor, the
Corporation shall pay declared and unpaid dividends to such holder of Preferred Stock in
Common Stock; and (ii) in cash (at the Common Stock’s fair market value determined by the
Board of Directors as of the date of conversion) the value of any fractional share of Common
Stock otherwise issuable to any holder of Preferred Stock. Such conversion shall be deemed to
have been made at the close of business on the date of such surrender of the certificates
representing the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person entitled to receive the
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the
record holder of such shares of Common Stock on such date.

(vii) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If at
any time or from time to time after the date the first share of Preferred Stock was issued the
Corporation effects a subdivision of the outstanding Common Stock without a corresponding
subdivision of the Preferred Stock, the applicable Preferred Stock Conversion Price in effect

time or from time to time after the date the first share of Preferred Stock was issued the
Corporation combines the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares
without a corresponding combination of the Preferred Stock. the applicable Preferred Stock
Conversion Price in effect immediately before the combination shall be proportionately
incrcased. Any adjustment under this Section 4.4(d)(vii) shall become effective at the close of
business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective.

Distributions. If at any time or from time to time after the date the first share of Preferred Stock
was issued the Corporation pays a dividend or other distribution in additional shares of Common
Stock, the applicable Preferred Stock Conversion Price that is then in effect shall be decreased as
of the time of such issuance, as provided below:
(A) The applicable Preferred Stock Conversion Price shall
be adjusted by multiplying the applicable Preferred Stock Conversion Price then in effect by a
fraction equal to:

(1) the numerator of which is the total number of
shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance,
and

(2) the denominator of which is the total number of
shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance
plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or
distribution;

(B) If the Corporation fixes a record date to determine
which holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution, the
applicable Preferred Stock Conversion Price shall be fixed as of the close of business on such
record date and the number of shares of Common Stock shall be calculated immediately prior to
the close of business on such record date; and

(C)If such record date is fixed and such dividend is not
fully paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the applicable
Preferred Stock Conversion Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on
such record date and thereafter the applicable Preferred Stock Conversion Price shall be adjusted
pursuant to this Section 4.4(d)(viii) to reflect the actual payment of such dividend or distribution.

(ix) Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange and
Substitution. If at any time or from time to time after the date the first share of Preferred Stock
was issued, the Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock is changed
into the same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by
recapitalization, reclassification or otherwise (other than an Acquisition or Asset Transfer or a
subdivision or combination of shares or stock dividend or a reorganization, merger, consolidation
or sale of assets provided for elsewhere in this Section 4.4(d)), in any such event each holder of
Preferred Stock shall then have the right to convert such stock into the kind and amount of stock
and other securities and property receivable upon such recapitalization, reclassification or other
change by holders of the maximum number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares
of Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately prior to such recapitalization,
reclassification or change, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein or with respect to
such other securities or property by the terms thereof.

(x) Reorganizations, Mergers or Consolidations. If at any
time or from time to time after the date the first share of Preferred Stock was issued, there is a
capital reorganization of the Common Stock or the merger or consolidation of the Corporation
with or into another corporation or another entity or person (other than an Acquisition or Asset
Transfer or a recapitalization, subdivision, combination, reclassification, exchange or
substitution of shares provided for elsewhere in this Section 4.4(d)), as a part of such capital
reorganization, provision shall be made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock shall thereafter
be entitled to receive upon conversion of the Preferred Stock the number of shares of stock or
other securities or property of the Corporation to which a holder of the number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled on such capital
reorganization, subject to adjustment in respect of such stock or securities by the terms thereof.
In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this
Section 4.4(d) with respect to the nghts of the holders of Preferred Stock after the capital
reorganization to the end that the provisions of this Section 4.4(d) (including adjustment of the
applicable Preferred Stock Conversion Price then in effect and the number of shares issuable
upon conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event and be as nearly
equivalent as practicable.

(xi) Sale of Shares Below Applicable Preferred Stock
Conversion Price.

(A)If at any time or from time to time after the date the
first share of Preferred Stock was issued, the Corporation issues or sells, or is deemed by the
express provisions of this Section 4.4(d)(xi) to have issued or sold, Additional Shares of
Common Stock, other than as a dividend or other distribution on any class of stock as provided
in Section 4.4(d)(viii) above, and other than a subdivision or combination of shares of. Co:
Stock as provided in Section 4.4(d)(vii) above, for an Effective Price (as defined below) less than-—
the then effective applicable Preferred Stock Conversion Price, unless the Corporation receives
written notice from the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding shares of the Series
B Preferred Stock, in the case the Effective Price is less than the Series B Preferred Stock
Conversion Price, or the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred Stock, in the case the Effective Price is less than the Series A Preferred Stock
Conversion Price, agreeing that no such adjustment shall be made, then the then existing
Preferred Stock Conversion Price, as applicable, shall be reduced, as of the opening of business
on the date of such issue or sale, to a price determined by multiplying the applicable Preferred
Stock Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale by a fraction equal
to:

(1) the numerator of which shall be (A) the number
of shares of Common Stock deemed outstanding (as defined below) immediately prior to such
issue or sale, plus (B) the number of shares of Common Stock which the Aggregate
Consideration (as defined below) received by the Corporation for the total number of Additional
Shares of Common Stock so issued would purchase at such applicable Preferred Stock
Conversion Price, and

(2) the denominator of which shall be the number of
shares of Common Stock deemed outstanding (as defined below) immediately prior to such issue
or sale plus the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued.

For the purposes of the second sentence of the preceding paragraph, the number of shares
of Common Stock deemed to be outstanding as of a given date shall be the sum of (A) the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding, (B) the number of shares of Common Stock
into which the then outstanding shares of Class C Common Stock could be converted if fully
converted on the day immediately preceding the given date, (C) the number of shares of
Common Stock into which the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock could be converted if

12.
fully converted on the day immediately preceding the given date and (D) the number of shares of
Common Stock into which the then outstanding options, warrants or subscriptions rights could
be exercised, exchanged or converted.

(B) No adjustment shall be made to the applicable Preferred
Stock Conversion Price in an amount less than one cent per share. Any adjustment otherwise
required by this Section 4.4(d)(xi) that is not required to be made due to the preceding sentence
shall be included in any subsequent adjustment to the applicable Preferred Stock Conversion
Price.

(C)For the purpose of making any adjustment required
under this Section 4.4(d)((xi), the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for any
issue or sale of securities (the “Aggregate Consideration”) shall be defined as: (A) to the extent it
consists of cash, be computed at the net amount of cash received by the Corporation after
deduction of any underwniting or similar commissions, compensation or concessions paid or
allowed by the Corporation in connection with such issue or sale but without deduction of any
other expenses payable by the Corporation, (B) to the extent it consists of property other than
cash, be computed at the fair value of that property as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors, and (C) if Additional Shares of Common Stock, Convertible Securities (as defined
below) or rights or options to purchase either Additional Shares of Common Stock or
Convertible Securities are issued or sold together with other stock or securities or other assets of
the Corporation for a consideration which covers both, be computed as the portion of the
consideration so received that may be reasonably determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors to be allocable to such Additional Shares of Common Stock, Convertible Securities or
rights or options.

(D)For the purpose of the adjustment required under this
Section 4.4(d)(xi), if the Corporation issues or sells (x) stock or other securities convertible into,
Additional Shares of Common Stock (such convertible stock or securities being herein referred
to as “Convertible Securities”) or (y) rights or options for the purchase of Additional Shares of
Common Stock or Convertible Securities and if the Effective Price of such Additional Shares of
Common Stock is less than the applicable Preferred Stock Conversion Price, in each case the
Corporation shall be deemed to have issued at the time of the issuance of such rights or options
or Convertible Securities the maximum number of Additional Shares of Common Stock issuable
upon exercise or conversion thereof and to have received as consideration for the issuance of
such shares an amount equal to the total amount of the consideration, if any, received by the
Corporation for the issuance of such rights or options or Convertible Securities plus:

(1) in the case of such rights or options, the
minimum amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such
rights or options; and

(2) in the case of Convertible Securities, the
minimum amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Corporation upon the conversion
thereof (other than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible
Securities); provided that if the minimum amounts of such consideration cannot be ascertained,
but are a function of anti-dilution or similar protective clauses, the Corporation shall be deemed
to have received the minimum amounts of consideration without reference to such clauses.

(3) If the minimum amount of consideration
payable to the Corporation upon the exercise or conversion of rights, options or Convertible
Securities is reduced over time or on the occurrence or non-occurrence of specified events other
than by reason of anti-dilution adjustments, the Effective Price shall be recalculated using the
figure to which such minimum amount of consideration is reduced; provided further, that if the
minimum amount of consideration payable to the Corporation upon the exercise or conversion of
such rights, options or Convertible Securities is subsequently increased, the Effective Price shall
be again recalculated using the increased minimum amount of consideration payable to the
Corporation upon the exercise or conversion of such rights, options or Convertible Securities.

(4) No further adjustment of the applicable
Preferred Stock Conversion Price, as adjusted upon the issuance of such nights, options or
Convertible Securities, shall be made as a result of the actual issuance of Additional Shares of
Common Stock or the exercise of any such rights or options or the conversion of any such
Convertible Securities. If any such rights or options or the conversion privilege represented by
any such Convertible Securities shall expire without having been exercised, the applicable
Preferred Stock Conversion Price as adjusted upon the issuance of such rights, options or
Convertible Securities shall be readjusted to the applicable Preferred Stock Conversion Price
which would have been in effect had an adjustment been made on the basis that the only
Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued were the Additional Shares of Common Stock, if
any, actually issued or sold on the exercise of such rights or options or nights of conversion of
such Convertible Securities, and such Additional Shares of Common Stock, if any, were issued
or sold for the consideration actually received by the Corporation upon such exercise, plus the
consideration, if any, actually received by the Corporation for the granting of all such nghts or
options, whether or not exercised, plus the consideration received for issuing or selling the
Convertible Securities actually converted, plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the
Corporation (other than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such
Convertible Sccurities) on the conversion of such Convertible Securities, provided that such
readjustment shall not apply to prior conversions of Preferred Stock.

(E) For the purpose of making any adjustment to the
applicable Preferred Stock Conversion Price required under this Section 4.4(d)(xi), “Additional
Shares of Common Stock” shall mean all shares of Common Stock issued by the Corporation or
deemed to be issued pursuant to this Section 4.4(d)(xi) (including shares of Common Stock
subsequently reacquired or retired by the Corporation), other than:

(1) shares of Common Stock issued upon
conversion of the Preferred Stock or the Class C Common Stock;

hereof to employees, officers or directors of, or consultants or advisors to the Corporation or any
subsidiary pursuant to stock purchase or stock option plans or other arrangements that are, in
each case, approved by the Board of Directors, including the affirmative vote of the directors
representing the holders of Series B Preferred Stock; provided, however, that such amount shall
be increased to reflect any shares of Common Stock (i) not issued pursuant to the rights,
agreements, options or warrants outstanding as of the filing date hereof (“Outstanding Options”)
as a result of the termination of such Outstanding Options or (ii) reacquired by the Corporation
from employees, directors or consultants at cost pursuant to agreements which permit the
Corporation to repurchase such shares upon termination of services to the Corporation;

(4) up to 3,796 shares of Series A Preferred Stock
and/or options, warrants or other Series A Preferred Stock purchase rights and the Series A
Preferred Stock issued pursuant to such options, warrants or other rights (as adjusted for any
stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like after the filing date hereof)

pursuant to stock purchase or stock option plans or other arrangements that are, in each case,
approved by the Board of Directors, including the affirmative vote of the directors representing
the holders of Series B Preferred Stock;

(5) shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to the
exercise of options, warrants or convertible securities outstanding as of the date of filing hereof;

(6) shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock

the issuance of shares therein has been approved by the Corporation’s Board of Directors.

References to Common Stock in the subsections of this clause (E) above shall mean all
shares of Common Stock issued by the Corporation or deemed to be issued pursuant to this
Section 4.4(d)(xi). The “Effective Price” of Additional Shares of Common Stock shall mean the
quotient determined by dividing the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock issued
or sold, or deemed to have been issued or sold by the Corporation under this Section 4.4(d)(xi),

15.
into the Aggregate Consideration received, or deemed to have been received by the Corporation
for such issue under this Section 4.4(d)(xi), for such Additional Shares of Common Stock.

(xii) Certificate of Adjustment. In each case of an adjustment
or readjustment of the applicable Preferred Stock Conversion Price for the number of shares of
Common Stock or other securities issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock, if any
Preferred Stock is then outstanding, the Corporation, at its expense, shall compute such
adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the provisions hereof and prepare a certificate
showing such adjustment or readjustment, and shall mail such certificate, by first class mail,

the holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend or other distribution, or (B) any
Acquisition or other capital reorganization of the Corporation, any reclassification or
recapitalization of the stock of the Corporation, any merger or consolidation of the Corporation
with or into any other corporation, or any Asset Transfer, or any voluntary or involuntary

majority of the then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock voting on an as-if-converted
to Common Stock basis) a notice specifying (1) the date on which any such record is to be taken
for the purpose of such dividend or distribution and a description of such dividend or
distribution, (2) the date on which any such Acquisition, reorganization, reclassification, transfer,
consolidation, merger, Asset Transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to

Common Stock (or other securities) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock

liquidation or winding up.

(xiv) Automatic Conversion.

(A)Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be
converted into shares of Common Stock, based on the then-effective applicable Preferred Stock
Conversion Price (1) immediately upon the closing of a firmly underwritten public offering
pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
covering the offer and sale of Common Stock for the account of the Corporation in which (i) the

upon the election of the holders of at Jeast a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred Stock. Upon such automatic conversion, any declared and unpaid dividends shall be
paid in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.4(d){vi).

(B) Upon the occurrence of either of the events specified in
Section 4.4(d)(xiv)(A) above, the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock and/or Series A
Preferred Stock, as the case may be, shall be converted automatically without any further action
by the holders of such shares and regardless of whether the certificates representing such shares
are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent; provided, however, that the Corporation
shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon
such conversion unless the certificates evidencing such shares of Series B Preferred Stock and/or
Series A Preferred Stock, as the case may be, are either delivered to the Corporation or its
transfer agent as provided below, or the holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that
such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the
Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such
certificates. Upon the occurrence of such automatic conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock
and/or Series A Preferred Stock, as the case may be, the holders of Series B Preferred Stock
and/or Series A Preferred Stock, as the case may be, shall surrender the certificates representing
such shares at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for the Series B Preferred Stock
and/or Series A Preferred Stock. Thereupon, there shall be issued and delivered to such holder
promptly at such office and in its name as shown on such surrendered certificate or certificates, a
certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of
Series B Preferred Stock and/or Series A Preferred Stock, as the case may be, surrendered were
convertible on the date on which such automatic conversion occurred, and any declared and
unpaid dividends shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.4(d)(vi).

(xv) Special Automatic Conversion.

Class C Common Stock that did not elect to participate in the Qualified Fipancing (as defined
below) by notifying the Corporation of such holder’s election to purchasé in the aggregate, in
such Qualified Financing and within the time period specified by the Corporation (the
Corporation has previously sent to each holder of Series A Preferred Stock and Class C Common
Stock at least 15 days written notice of, and the opportunity to purchase its Pro Rata Amount (as
defined below) in the Qualified Financing)), such holder’s Pro Rata Amount, then effective
upon, subject to, and concurrently with, the consummation of the Qualified Financing, all shares
of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Class C Common Stock, as the case may be, held by
such holder shall automatically/-and without any further action on the part of such holder, be
converted, in the case of Serig§ A Preferred Stock, into shares of Common Stock at the Series A
Preferred Stock Conversion Price/in effect immediately prior to the consummation of such
Qualified Financing, and, in the cdse of Class C Common Stock, into shares of Common Stock at
the rate of one share of Common Stock for each share of Class C Common Stock then
outstanding, in each case, effective upon, subject to, and concurrently with, the consummation of

(A) Any holder of shares of Seri Pyacing Stock or

17.
the Qualified Financing. For purposes of determining the number of shares of Series A Preferred
Stock owned by a holder, and for determining the number of Offered Securities (as defined
below) a holder of Series A Preferred Stock has purchased in a Qualified Financing, all shares of
Series A Preferred Stock held by Affiliates (as defined below) of such holder shall be aggregated
with such holder’s shares and all Offered Securities purchased by Affiliates of such holder shail
be aggregated with the Offered Securities purchased by such holder (provided that no shares or
securities shall be attributed to more than one entity or person within any such group of affiliated
entities or persons). For purposes of determining the number of shares of Class C Common
Stock owned by a holder, and for determining the number of Offered Securities a holder of Class
C Common Stock has purchased in a Qualified Financing, all shares of Class C Common Stock
held by Affiliates (as defined below) of such holder shall be aggregated with such holder’s
shares and all Offered Securities purchased by Affiliates of such holder shall be aggregated with
the Offered Securities purchased by such holder (provided that no shares or securities shall be
attributed to more than one entity or person within any such group of affiliated entities or
persons). Such conversion is referred to as a “Special Automatic Conversion”.

(B) Upon a Special Automatic Conversion, each holder
of shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Class C Common Stock, as the case may be, converted
pursuant to Section 4.4(d)(xv) shall surrender such holder’s certificate or certificates for all such
shares (or, if such holder alleges that such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost
certificate affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the
Corporation against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the
alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate) to the Corporation at the place designated in
such notice, and shall thereafter receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Section 4.4(d)(xv). All rights with respect to the
Series A Preferred Stock or Class C Common Stock, as the case may be, converted pursuant to
Section 4.4(d)(xv), including the rights, if any, to receive notices and vote (other than as a holder
of Common Stock), will terminate, except only the rights of the holders thereof, upon surrender
of their certificate or certificates therefor (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement), to receive
the items provided for in the last sentence of this Section 4.4(d)(xv)(B). If so required by the
Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by written
instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by
the registered holder or by such holder’s attomey duly authorized in writing. As soon as
practicable after the Special Automatic Conversion and the surrender of the certificate or
certificates (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement) for Series A Preferred Stock or Class C
Common Stock, as the case may be, so converted, the Corporation shall issue and deliver to such
holder, or to such holder’s nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of
Common Stock issuable on such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof, together
with cash in lieu of any fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such
conversion and the payment of any declared but unpaid dividends on the shares of Senes A
Preferred Stock or Class C Common Stock, as the case may be, converted.

(C) All shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Class C
Common Stock, as the case may be, shall, from and after the time of the Special Automatic
Conversion, no longer be deemed to be outstanding and, notwithstanding the failure of the holder
or holders thereof to surrender the certificates for such shares on or prior to such time, all nights
with respect to such shares shall immediately cease and terminate at the time of the Special

18.
Automatic Conversion, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive shares of Common
Stock in exchange therefor and to receive payment of any dividends declared but unpaid thereon.
Such converted Series A Preferred Stock or Class C Common Stock, as the case may be, shall be
retired and cancelled and may not be reissued as shares of such series, and the Corporation may
thereafter take such appropriate action (without the need for stockholder action) as may be
necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Class C
Common Stock, as the case may be, accordingly.

(D) For purposes of this Section 4.4(d)(xv), the
following definitions shall apply:

(1) “Affiliate” shall mean, with respect to any
holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Class C Common Stock, as the case may be, any
person, entity or firm which, directly or indirectly, controls, is controlled by or is under common
contro] with such holder, including, without limitation, any entity of which the holder is a partner
or member, any partner, officer, director, member or employee of such holder and any venture
capital fund now or hereafter existing of which the holder is a partner or member which is
controlled by or under common control with one or more general partners of such holder or
shares the same management company with such holder.

(2) “Offered Securities” shall mean the equity
securities of the Corporation set aside by the Board of Directors of the Corporation for purchase
by holders of outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Class C Common Stock, as the
case may be, in connection with a Qualified Financing, and offered to such holders.

(3) “Pro Rata Amount” shall mean, (i) with
respect to any holder of Series A Preferred Stock, the number of Offered Securities calculated by
multiplying the aggregate number of Offered Securities by a fraction, the numerator of which is
equal to the number of shares of the Company’s Common Stock (including all shares of
Common Stock issued or issuable upon conversion of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and
Class C Common Stock) which such holder is deemed to be a holder immediately prior to the
issuance of such Offered Securities and the denominator of which is equal to the total number of
shares of the Company’s outstanding Common Stock (including all shares of Common Stock
issued or issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock and Class C Common Stock,
but excluding shares of Common Stock issued or issuable upon the exercise of any outstanding
warrants or options) or (ii) with respect to any holder of Class C Common Stock, the number of
Offered Securities calculated by multiplying the aggregate number of Offered Securities by a
fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the number of shares of the Company’s Common
Stock (including all shares of Common Stock issued or issuable upon conversion of the shares of
Series A Preferred Stock and Class C Common Stock) which such holder is deemed to be a
holder immediately prior to the issuance of such Offered Securities and the denominator of
which is equal to the total number of shares of the Company’s outstanding Common Stock
(including all shares of Common Stock issued or issuable upon conversion of the Series A
Preferred Stock and Class C Common Stock, but excluding shares of Common Stock issued or
issuable upon the exercise of any outstanding warrants or options).

Effective Time which would result in at least $3,500,000 in gross proceeds to the Corporation

(xvi) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock
shall be issued upon conversion of Preferred Stock. All shares of Common Stock (including
fractions thereof) issuable upon conversion of more than one share of Preferred Stock by a
holder thereof shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the conversion would
result in the issuance of any fractional share. If, after the aforementioned aggregation, the
conversion would result in the issuance of any fractional share, the Corporation shall, in lieu of
issuing any fractional share, pay cash equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by the
Common Stock’s fair market value {as determined by the Board of Directors) on the date of
conversion.

(xvii) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The
Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares
of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the
Preferred Stock, such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be
sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock. If at any time
the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect
the conversion of all then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such
corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but
unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such

purpose.

(xviii) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this
Section 4 shall be in writing and shall be deemed effectively given: (A) upon personal delivery to
the party to be notified, (B) when sent by confirmed electronic mail or facsimile if sent during
normal business hours of the recipient; if not, then on the next business day, (C) five (5) days
after having been sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid,
or (D) one (1) day after deposit with a nationally recognized overnight courier, specifying next
day delivery, with verification of receipt. All notices shall be addressed to each holder of record
at the address of such holder appearing on the books of the Corporation.

(xix) Payment of Taxes. The Corporation will pay all taxes
(other than taxes based upon income) and other governmental charges that may be imposed with
respect to the issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of shares of
Preferred Stock, excluding any tax or other charge imposed in connection with any transfer
involved in the issue and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in which
the shares of Preferred Stock so converted were registered.

(xx) No Dilution or Impairment. Without the consent of the
holders of then outstanding Preferred Stock as required under Section 4.4(b), the Corporation
shall not amend its Certificate of Incorporation or participate in any reorganization, transfer of
assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or take any other voluntary
action, for the purpose of avoiding or seeking to avoid the observance or performance of any of

20.
the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Corporation, but shall at all times in
good faith assist in carrying out all such action as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate in
order to protect the conversion rights of the holders of Preferred Stock against dilution or other
impairment.

Corporation for the Series B Preferred Stock or at the principal office of the Corporation or at
such other place as may be designated by the Corporation, the certificate or certificates for the

through the respective Series B Redemption Date, whether or not declared, provided such
dividends are from earnings and (2) all other declared and unpaid dividends on each share
provided such dividends are from eamings, divided by (B) the number of outstanding shares of
Series B Preferred Stock on an as converted basis (including shares of Common Stock into
which shares of Series B Preferred Stock have actually been converted, if any), and (111) the fair

21.
value of one share of Series B Preferred Stock at the time of the First Series B Redemption Date,
as determined by an independent appraiser selected by the holders of a two-thirds (66.67%) of
the Series B Preferred Stock then outstanding which appraiser shall be reasonably satisfactory to
the Corporation, such amount being referred to as the “Series B Redemption Price.” Such
payment shall be made in full on each of the Series B Redemption Dates to the holders entitled
thereto.

(c) Redemption of Series A Preferred Stock. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, upon and subject to the availability of sufficient cash
in the Corporation to redeem all of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock in accordance with
Sections 4.5(a) and (b) above, the Corporation shall redeem the Series A Preferred Stock in
accordance with this Section 4.5(c). The Corporation shall not have the right to call or redeem at
any time all or any shares of Series A Preferred Stock. With the approval of the holders of a
majority of the then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, one or more holders of
shares of Series A Preferred Stock may, by giving notice (the “Series A Redemption Notice”) to
the Corporation at any time after November 30, 2011, require the Corporation to redecm all of
the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock in three equal annual installments, with one-third of the
shares of Series A Preferred Stock redeemed on the First Series A Redemption Date (as defined
below), one-third of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock redeemed on the first anniversary of
the First Series A Redemption Date (the “Second Series A Redemption Date”) and the remainder
redeemed on the second anniversary of the First Series A Redemption Date (the “Third Series A
Redemption Date”). Upon receipt of the Series A Redemption Notice, the Corporation will so
notify all other persons holding Series A Preferred Stock. After receipt of the Series A
Redemption Notice, the Corporation shall fix the first date for redemption (the “First Series A
Redemption Date”), provided that such First Series A Redemption Date shall occur within ninety
(90) days after receipt of the Series A Redemption Notice. All holders of Series A Preferred
Stock shall deliver to the Corporation during regular business hours, at the office of any transfer
agent of the Corporation for the Series A Preferred Stock or at the principal office of the
Corporation or at such other place as may be designated by the Corporation, the certificate or
certificates for the Series A Preferred Stock duly endorsed for transfer to the Corporation or in
blank on or before the First Series A Redemption Date. The First Series A Redemption Date, the
Second Series A Redemption Date and the Third Series A Redemption Date are collectively
referred to as the “Series A Redemption Dates” and together with the Series B Redemption
Dates, the “Redemption Dates”.

(d) Series A Redemption Price and Payment. The Series A
Preferred Stock to be redeemed on the Series A Redemption Dates shall be redeemed by paying
for each share in cash an amount equal to (A) six (6) times the trailing twelve months of the
Corporation’s EBITDA, as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, plus an amount equal to the total amount of (i) all accrued and unpaid dividends on
each share through the respective Series A Redemption Date, whether or not declared, and (ii) all
other declared and unpaid dividends on each share, divided by (B) the number of outstanding
shares of Series A Preferred Stock on an as converted basis (including shares of Common Stock
into which shares of Series A Preferred Stock have actually been converted, if any), such amount
being referred to as the “Series A Redemption Price.” Such payment shal! be made in full on
each of the Series A Redemption Dates to the holders entitled thereto.

22.
(e) PPL Redemption; Redemption Price and Payment. Upon the
redemption, repurchase or reverse split by the Corporation of any of its issued and outstanding
shares of stock, the Corporation shall simultaneously redeem and repurchase that number of
shares of Corporation stock held by PPL Broadband, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
(and any of its affiliates) (“PPL”) necessary to maintain PPL’s ownership of the Corporation at
the Non-Affiliate Percentage (as defined below). Such redemptions shall be at a purchase price
equal to (A) six (6) times the trailing twelve months of the Corporation's EBITDA, plus all
accrued and unpaid dividends on each such share through the time of redemption or repurchase
hereunder, divided by (B) the number of outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock on an as
converted basis (including shares of Common Stock into which shares of Series A Preferred
Stock have actually been converted, if any), and consideration for such shares may, at the
election of the Corporation, be paid in cash or in the form of promissory note with a three year
term, and bearing interest at 8.0% per annum. To the extent that this Section 4.5(c) requires the
redemption or repurchase of less than all of the shares of the Corporation’s stock held by PPL,
the shares of the Corporation’s stock redeemed or repurchased pursuant to this Section 4.5(c)
shall be redeemed or repurchased in the same sequence in which such shares were issued. The
term “Non-A ffiliate Percentage” shall mean that number of shares of stock of the Corporation
that provides PPL 19.9% ownership of the Corporation, as such percentage shall be determined
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied by PPL in
connection with its preparation of its consolidated financial reports.

(f) Redemption Mechanics. With respect to the redemption
contemplated by Sections 4.5(a), (b), (c) and (d): At least 20 but not more than 30 days prior to
each Redemption Date, written notice (the “Redemption Notice”) shall be given by the
Corporation by mail, postage prepaid, or by facsimile transmission to non-U.S. residents, to each
holder of record (at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which
the Redemption Notice is given) of shares of Series B Preferred Stock or Series A Preferred
Stock, as the case may be, notifying such holder of the redemption and specifying the Series B
Redemption Price or Series A Redemption Price, as the case may be, the Redemption Date and
the place where said Series B Redemption Price or Series A Redemption Price, as the case may
be, shall be payable. The Redemption Notice shall be addressed to each holder at his electronic
or other address as shown by the records of the Corporation. From and after the close of
business on the applicable Redemption Date, unless there shall have been a default in the
payment of the Series B Redemption Price or Series A Redemption Price, as the case may be, all
rights of holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock or Series A Preferred Stock, as the case
may be (except the right to receive the Series B Redemption Price or the Series A Redemption
Price, as the case may be) shall cease with respect to such shares, and such shares shall not
thereafter be transferred on the books of the Corporation or be deemed to be outstanding for any
purpose whatsoever. If the funds of the Corporation legally available for redemption of shares of
Series B Preferred Stock on any applicable Series B Redemption Date are insufficient to redeem
the total number of outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such Series
B Redemption Date, the holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall share ratably in any
funds legally available for redemption of such shares according to the respective amounts which
would be payable with respect to the full number of shares owned by them if all such outstanding
shares were redeemed in full. The shares of Series B Preferred Stock not redeemed shall remain
outstanding and entitled to all rights and preferences provided herein. The Corporation shall not
make any payments to redeem shares of Series A Preferred Stock in the event there is not

23.
available sufficient cash to redeem all of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock. At any time
thereafter when additional funds of the Corporation are legally available for the redemption of
such shares of Series B Preferred Stock such funds will be used, no later than the end of the next
succeeding fiscal quarter, to redeem the balance of such shares, or such portion thereof for which
funds are then legally available, on the basis set forth above. If, following the redemption of all
shares of Series B Preferred Stock, the funds of the Corporation legally available for redemption
of shares of Series A Preferred Stock on any applicable Series A Redemption Date are
insufficient to redeem the total number of outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be
redeemed on such Series A Redemption Date, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock
shall share ratably in any funds legally available for redemption of such shares according to the
respective amounts which would be payable with respect to the full number of shares owned by
them if all such outstanding shares were redeemed in full. The shares of Series A Preferred
Stock not redeemed shall remain outstanding and entitled to all rights and preferences provided
herein. At any time thereafter when additional funds of the Corporation are legally available for
the redemption of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock such funds will be used, no later than
the end of the next succeeding fiscal quarter, to redeem the balance of such shares, or such
portion thereof for which funds are then legally available, on the basis set forth above.

(g) Redeemed or Otherwise Acquired Shares to be Retired. Any
shares of Preferred Stock redeemed pursuant to this Section 4.5 or otherwise acquired by the
Corporation in any manner whatsoever shall be canceled and shall not under any circumstances
be reissued; and the Corporation may from time to time take such appropriate corporate action as
may be necessary to reduce accordingly the number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock.

the following rights with respect to the conversion of the Class C Common Stock into Common
Stock (the “Class C Common Stock Conversion Rights”):

(i) Optional Conversion. Subject to and in compliance with the
provisions of this Section 4.7(e), each share of Class C Common Stock may, at the option of the
holder, be converted at any time into one fully-paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock.

(ii) | Mechanics of Conversion. Before the holders of the Class C
Common Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into Common Stock pursuant to Section
4.7(e)(i), each such holder shall surrender the certificate therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of
the Corporation or of any transfer agent for the Class C Common Stock, and shall give written
notice by registered mail, postage prepaid, to the Corporation at its principal corporate office, of
the election to convert the same, and such conversion shall be deemed to have been made
immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the Class C Common
Stock to be converted; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue
certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion unless the
certificates evidencing such shares of Class C Common Stock are either delivered to the

25.
Corporation or its transfer agent, or the holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that
such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the
Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such
certificates. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver to such
address as each such holder may direct, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of
Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled.

(iii) Automatic Conversion.

(A) Each share of Class C Common Stock shall automatically
be converted into one share of Common Stock (1) immediately upon the closing of a firmly
underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, covering the offer and sale of Common Stock for the account of the
Corporation in which (i) the per share price is at least $14.322 (as adjusted for stock splits,
dividends, recapitalizations and the like after the filing date hereof), and (ii) the gross cash
proceeds to the Corporation (before underwriting discounts, commissions and fees) are at least
$30,000,000 or (2) upon the election of holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding
shares of Class C Common Stock.

(B) Upon the occurrence of either of the events specified in
Section 4.7(e)(iii) above, the outstanding shares of Class C Common Stock shall be converted
automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and regardless of whether
the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent;
provided, however, that the Corporation shal] not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion unless the certificates evidencing such
shares of Class C Common Stock are either delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent as
provided below, or the holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates
have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to
indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates.
Upon the occurrence of such automatic conversion of the Class C Common Stock, the holders of
Class C Common Stock shall surrender the certificates representing such shares at the office of
the Corporation or any transfer agent for the Class C Common Stock. Thereupon, there shall be
issued and delivered to such holder promptly at such office and in its name as shown on such
surrendered certificate or certificates, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of
Common Stock into which the shares of Class C Common Stock surrendered were convertible
on the date on which such automatic conversion occurred.

(iv) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The
Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares
of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Class C
Common Stock, such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be
sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of the Class C Common Stock. If at
any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient
to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Class C Common Stock, the
Corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to
increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall
be sufficient for such purpose.

26.
(v) Status of Converted Stock. In the event the shares of Class C
Common Stock shall be converted pursuant to this Section 4.7(e), the shares so converted shall
be canceled and shall not be reissued by the Corporation.

(vi) No Impairment. The Corporation will not, by amendment of this
Certificate of Incorporation or through any reorganization, recapitalization, transfer of assets,
consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid
or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed
hereunder by the Corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all
the provisions of this Section 2 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or
appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holders of the Class C Common Stock
against impairment.
