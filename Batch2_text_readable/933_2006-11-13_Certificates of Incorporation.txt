5. . CONVERSION RIGHTS.

The holders of the Convertible Preferred shall have the following rights
with respect to the conversion of the Convertible Preferred into shares of Common Stock {the
“Conversion Rights”):

(a) Optional Conversion. Subject to and in compliance with the
provisions of this Section 5, any shares of the Convertible Preferred may, at the option of the
holder, be converted at any time into fully-paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock. The
number of shares of Common Stock to which a holder of the Convertible Preferred shall be
entitled upon conversion shall be the product obtained by multiplying the applicable
“Convertible Preferred Conversion Rate” then in effect (determined as provided in Section 5(b))
by the number of shares of Convertible Preferred being converted.

CHARH919992u4 7

-(b) Convertible Preferred Conversion Rate. The conversion rate in
effect at any time for conversion of any series of Convertible Preferred (the “Convertible
Preferred Conversion Rate”) shall be the quotient obtained by dividing the applicable Original
Issue Price of such series of Convertible Preferred by the applicable “Convertible Preferred
Conversion Price” of such series, calculated as provided in Section 5(c).

(c) Convertible Preferred Conversion Price. The conversion price
for each series of Convertible Preferred shall initially be the applicable Original Issue Price of
such series of Convertible Preferred (the “Convertible Preferred Conversion Price”). Such
initial Convertible Preferred Conversion Price shall be adjusted from time to time in accordance
with this Section 5. All references to the Convertible Preferred Conversion Price herein shall
mean the applicable Convertible Preferred Conversion Price as so adjusted.

(dé) Mechanics of Conversion, Each holder of Convertible Preferred
who desires to convert the same into shares of Common Stock pursuant to this Section 5 shall
surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Company or
any transfer agent for the Convertible Preferred, and shall give written notice to the Company at
such office that such holder elects to convert the same. Such notice shall state the number of
shares of Convertible Preferred being converted. Thereupon, the Company shall promptly issue
and deliver at such office to such holder a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled and shall promptly pay (i) in cash or, to the
extent sufficient funds are not then legally available therefor, in Common Stock (at the Common
Stock’s fair market value determined by the Board as of the date of such conversion), any
declared and unpaid dividends on the shares of Convertible Preferred being converted and (ii) in
cash {at the Common Stock’s fair market value determined by the Board as of the date of
conversion) the value of any fractional share of Common Stock otherwise issuable to any holder
of Convertible Preferred. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made at the close of
business on the date of such surrender of the certificates representing the shares of Convertible
Preferred to be converted, and the person entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such shares
of Common Stock on such date.

{e) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If at any time or
from time to time after the Original Issue Date, as defined below, the Company effects a
subdivision of the outstanding Common Stock without a corresponding subdivision of the
Preferred Stock, the Convertible Preferred Conversion Price in effect immediately before that
subdivision shall be proportionately decreased. Conversely, if at any time or from time to time
on or after the Orginal Issue Date the Company combines the outstanding shares of Common
Stock into a smaller number of shares without a corresponding combination of the Preferred
Stock, the Convertible Preferred Conversion Price in effect immediately before the combination
shall be proportionately increased. Any adjustment under this Section S{e) shall become
effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective.
For the purposes of this Section 5, the “Original Issue Date” shall be the date upon which the
first share of Series C Preferred is issued,

CHARIS19992v4 8

(f) Adjustment for Common Stock Dividends and Distributions.
If at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date the Company pays to holders of
Common Stock a dividend or other distribution in additional shares of Common Stock without a
corresponding dividend or other distribution to holders of the Convertible Preferred, the
Convertible Preferred Conversion Price then in effect shall be decreased as of the time of such
issuance, as provided below:

{i) The Convertible Preferred Conversion Price shall be
adjusted by multiplymg the Convertible Preferred Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction
equal to: .

(A) the numerator of which is the total number of shares
of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance, and

(B) the denominator of which is the total number of
shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance
plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or
distribution;

(ii) If the Company fixes a record date to determine which
holders of Common Stock are entitled fo recerve such dividend or other distribution, the
Convertible Preferred Conversion Price shall be fixed as of the close of business on such record
date and the number of shares of Common Stock shall be calculated immediately prior to the:
close of business on such record date; and

(iii) If such record date is fixed and such dividend is not fully
paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the Convertible Preferred
Conversion Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record date
and thereafter the Convertible Preferred Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this
Section 5(f) to réflect the actual payment of such dividend or distribution.

(g) Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange, Substitution,
Reorganization, Merger or Consolidation. If at any time or from time to time after the
Oniginal Issue Date the Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Convertible Preferred
is changed into the same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock, whether —
by recapitalization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or otherwise (other than an
Acquisition or Asset Transfer as defined in Section 4 or a subdivision or combination of shares
or stock dividend provided for elsewhere in this Section 5), in any such event each holder of
Convertible Preferred shal] then have the right to convert such stock into the kind and amount of
stock and other securities and property receivable upon such recapitalization, reclassification,
merger, consolidation or other change by holders of the maximum number of shares of Common
Stock into which such shares of Convertible Preferred could have been converted immediately
prior to such recapitalization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or change, all subject to
further adjustment as provided herein or with respect to such other securities or property by the
terms thereof. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the
provisions of this Section 5 with respect to the rights of the holders of Convertible Preferred after

CHARI919992v4 g

the capital reorganization to the end that the provisions of this Section 5 (including adjustment of —
the Convertible Preferred Conversion Price then in effect and the number of shares issuable upon
conversion of the Convertible Preferred) shall be applicable after that event and be as nearly
equivalent as practicable.

(h} Sale of Shares Below Convertible Preferred Conversion Price.

(i) If at any time or from time to time on or after the Original
Issue Date, the Company issues or sells, or is deemed by the express provisions of this Section
5(h) to have issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock (as defined below), other than
as provided in Section 5(e), 5(f) or 5(g) above, for an Effective Price (as defined below) less than
the then effective Convertible Preferred Conversion Price (a “Qualifying Dilutive Issuance”),
then and in each such case, the then existing Convertible Preferred Conversion Price shall be
reduced, as of the opening of business on the date of such issue or sale, to a price determined by
multiplying the Convertible Preferred Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such
issuance or sale by a fraction equal to:

(A) the numerator of which shail be (A) the number of
shares of Common Stock deemed outstanding (as determined below) immediately prior to such
issue or sale, plus (B) the number of shares of Common Stock which the Aggregate
Consideration (as defined below) received or deemed received by the Company for the total
number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued would purchase at such then-existing
Convertible Preferred Conversion Price, and

(B) the denominator of which shall be the number of
shares of Common Stock deemed outstanding (as determined below) immediately prior to such
issue or Sale plus the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued.

For the purposes of the preceding sentence, the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to
be outstanding as of a given date shall be the sum of (A) the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding, (B) the number of shares of Common Stock into which the then outstanding shares
of Convertible Preferred could be converted if fully converted on the day immediately preceding
the given date, and (C) the number of shares of Common Stock which are issuable upon the
exercise or conversion of all other rights, options and convertible securities outstanding on the
day immediately preceding the given date.

(ii) | No adjustment shall be made to the Convertible Preferred
Conversion Price in an amount less than one cent per share. Any adjustment required by this
Section 5{h) shall be rounded to the nearest $0.0001 per share. Any adjustment otherwise
required by this Section 5(h) that is not required to be made due to the preceding two sentences
shall be included in any subsequent adjustment to the Convertible Preferred Conversion Price.

(iii) | For the purpose of making any adjustment required under
this Section 5(h), the aggregate consideration received by the Company for any issue or sale of
securities (the “Aggregate Consideration’) shall be defined as: (A) to the extent it consists of
cash, be computed at the gross amount of cash received by the Company before deduction of any

CHARN919992v4 10

underwriting or similar commissions, compensation or concessions paid or allowed by the
Company in connection with such issue or sale and without deduction of any expenses payable
by the Company, (B) to the extent it consists of property other than cash, be computed at the fair
value of that property as determined in good faith by the Board, and (C) if Additional Shares of
Common Stock, Convertible Securities (as defined below) or rights or options to purchase either
Additional Shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities are issued or sold together with
other stock or securities or other assets of the Company for a consideration which covers both, be
computed as the portion of the consideration so received that may be reasonably determined in
good faith by the Board to be allocable to such Additional Shares of Common Stock, Convertible
Securities or rights or options.

(iv) For the purpose of the adjustment required under this
Section 5(h), if the Company issues or sells (x) Preferred Stock or other stock, options, warrants,
purchase rights or other securities convertible into, Additional Shares of Common Stock (such
convertible stock or securities being herein referred to as “Convertible Securities’) or (y) rights
or options for the purchase of Additional Shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities and
if the Effective Price of such Additional Shares of Common Stock is less than the Convertible
Preferred Conversion Price, in each case the Company shall be deemed to have issued at the time
of the issuance of such rights or options or Convertible Securities the maximum number of
Additional Shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise or conversion thereof and to have
received as consideration for the issuance of such shares an amount equal to the total amount of
the consideration, if any, received by the Company for the issuance of such rights or options or
Convertible Securities plus:

(A) _ in the case of such rights or options, the minimum
amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon the exercise of such rights or
options; and

(B) in the case of Convertible Securities, the minimum
amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon the conversion thereof (other
than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities);
provided that if the minimum amounts of such consideration cannot be ascertained, but are a
function of antidilution or similar protective clauses, the Company shall be deemed to have
received the minimum amounts of consideration without reference to such clauses.

. {C) If the minimum amount of consideration payable to
the Company upon the exercise or conversion of rights, options or Convertible Securities is
reduced over time or on the occurrence or non-occurrence of specified events other than by
reason of antidilution adjustments, the Effective Price shall be recalculated using the figure to
which such minimum amount of consideration is reduced; provided further, that if the minimum
amount of consideration payable to the Company upon the exercise or conversion of such rights,
options or Convertible Securities is subsequently increased, the Effective Price shall be again
recalculated using the increased minimum amount of consideration payable to the Company upon
the exercise or conversion of such rights, options or Convertible Securities.

CHARIOII992v4 1]

. (D) No further adjustment of the Convertible Preferred
Conversion Price, as adjusted upon the issuance of such rights, options or Convertible Securities,
shall be made as a result of the actual issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock or the
exercise of any such rights or options or the conversion of any such Convertible Securities. If
any such rights or options or the conversion privilege represented by any such Convertible
Securities shall expire without having been exercised, the Convertible Preferred Conversion
Price as adjusted upon the issuance of such rights, options or Convertible Securities shall be
readjusted to the Convertible Preferred Conversion Price which would have been in effect had an
adjustment been made on the basis that the only Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued
were the Additional Shares of Common Stock, if any, actually issued or sold on the exercise of
such rights or options of rights of conversion of such Convertible Securities, and such Additional
Shares of Common Stock, if any, were issued or sold for the consideration actually received by
the Company upon such exercise, plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the
Company for the granting of all such rights or options, whether or not exercised, plus the
consideration received for issuing or selling the Convertible Securities actually converted, plus
the consideration, if any, actually received by the Company (other than by cancellation of
habilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities) on the conversion of such
Convertible Securities, provided that such readjustment shall not apply to prior conversions of
Convertible Preferred.

(v) For the purpose of making any adjustment to the
Conversion Price of the Convertible Preferred required under this Section 5(h), “Additional
Shares of Common Stock” shali mean all shares of Common Stock issued by the Company or
deemed to be issued pursuant to this Section 5(h) (including shares of Common Stock
subsequently reacquired or retired by the Company), other than:

(A) shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of
the Convertible Preferred;

shares of Non-Convertible Preferred, voting together as a separate class, may require the
Company, to the extent it may lawfully do so, to redeem the Non-Convertible Preferred (i) upon
(or, at the election of such holders, at any time after) the closing of a firmly underwritten public
offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, covering the offer and sale of Common Stock for the account of the Company (the
“IPO Redemption Date”), or (ii) in four (4) equal annual installments beginning not prior to the
sixth anniversary of the Original Issue Date (as defined above in Section IV.D.5(e)) (each an
“Installment Redemption Date”). The Company shall effect such redemptions on the IPO
Redemption Date or each Installment Redemption Date, as applicable (each a “Redemption
Date”), by paying in cash in exchange for the shares of Non-Convertible Preferred to be
redeemed on such date, a sum equal to (i) the Original Issue Price per share of the Non-
Convertible Preferred plus (ii) all accrued and unpaid dividends on such shares as of such date,
including notional interest, as provided in Section 1{a) above. The total amount to be paid for
the Non-Convertible Preferred is hereinafter referred to as the “Redemption Price.” The number
of shares of Non-Convertible Preferred that the Company shall be required to redeem on the IPO
Redemption Date shall be equal to the aggregate number of shares of Non-Convertible Preferred
outstanding immediately prior to the IPO Redemption Date. The number of shares of Non-
Convertible Preferred that the Company shall be required to redeem any one Installment
Redemption Date shall be equal to the amount determined by dividing (A) the aggregate number
of shares of Non-Convertible Preferred outstanding immediately prior to the Installment
Redemption Date by (B) the number of remaining Installment Redemption Dates (including the
Installment Redemption Date to which such calculation applies). Shares subject to redemption
on an Installment Redemption Date pursuant to this Section 5(a) shall be redeemed from each
holder of each series of Non-Convertible Preferred on a pro rata basis, based on the number of
shares of such series then held. For purposes of this Section 5(a)(i), the “Series B Original Issue
Date” shail be the date after the first share of Series B Preferred is issued.

(ii) At least thirty (30) days but no more than sixty (60) days

Preferred to be redeemed setting forth (A) the Redemption Price for the shares to be redeemed;
and (B) the place at which such holders may obtain payment of the Redemption Price upon
surrender of their share certificates. If the Company does not have sufficient funds legally
available to redeem all shares to be redeemed at the Redemption Date, then it shall so notify such
holders and shall redeem such shares pro rata (based on the portion of the aggregate Redemption
Price payable to them) to the extent possible and shall redeem the remaining shares to be
redeemed as soon as sufficient funds are legally available.
