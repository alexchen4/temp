(1) — inthe case of Convertible Securities or Options for
Common Stock the only Additional Sharcs of Common Stock issued were
the shares of Common Stock, if any, actually issued upon the exercise of
such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities
and the consideration reccived therefor was the consideration actually

which were actually converted or exchanged, plus the additional consid-

6034461 6v5 A-9
CSC ; 1D :?916-563-2121 JAN 16°04 16:45 No.002 P.12

and in such event, the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock shall be
reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price equal to the lowest consideration per
share at which such Additional Shares of Common Stock are issued (or deemed issued
pursuant to Section C.4Gii) hereo!).

Following the date of the closing of the Qualified Equity Financing, in the event
this Corporation, at any time after such date, shall issue Additional Shares of Common

the Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock in cffect on the date of and
immediately prior to such issue, then and in such event, the Conversion Price for such
series of Preforred Stock shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price
(calculated to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying the Conversion Price for such
series of Preferred Stock by a [raction, the numerator of which shall be the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of
shares of Common Stock which the agercgate consideration received by the Corporation
for the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued would purchase at
the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to
such issuance, and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of such Additional
Shares of Common Stock so issued. For the purpose of the above calculation, the
mumber of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue shall be
calculated on a fully diluted basis, as if all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock and all
Convertible Securities had becn fully converted into shares of Common Stock
immediately prior to such issuance and any oulstanding warrants, options or other rights
for the purchase of shares of stock or convertible sccuritics had been fully exercised
immediately priory to such issuance (and the resulting, securities fully converted into
shares of Common Stock, ifso convertible as of such date), but not including in such
