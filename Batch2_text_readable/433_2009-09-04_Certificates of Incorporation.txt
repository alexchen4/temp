Directors, out of any assets at the time legally available therefor, at the Dividend Rate specified for
such shares of Preferred Stock payable in preference and priority to any declaration or payment of
any Distribution on Common Stock of the Corporation in such calendar year, No Distributions shall

holders of the Preferred Stock shall be on a pro rata, pari passu basis. The right to receive dividends
on shares of Preferred Stock shall not be cumulative, and no right to such dividends shall accrue to

apply if such payment is a payment made by the Corporation in connection with (i) repurchases of
Common Stock issued to or held by employees, officers, directors or consultants of the Corporation
or its subsidiaries at no greater cost than upon termination of their employment or services pursuant
to agreements providing for the right of said repurchase, (ii) repurchases of Common Stock issued to
or held by employees, officers, directors or consultants of the Corporation or its subsidiaries

such settlement is approved by the Corporation’s Board of Directors, or (iv) any other repurchase or
redemption of capital stock of the Corporation approved by the holders of at least sixty percent
(60%) of the Preferred Stock of the Corporation, voting as a single class on an as-converted to
common stock basis.

3, Liquidation Rights.

(a) Series A2 Liquidation Preference. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution,
or winding up of the Corporation, either voluntary or involuntary (a “Liquidation Event,” as further
defined in Section 3(e) below), the holders of the Series A2 Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
receive, prior and in preference to any Distribution of any of the assets of the Corporation to the
holders of the Series A Preferred Stock or Common Stock by reason of their ownership of such
stock, an amount per share for each share of Series A2 Preferred Stock held by them equal to the
sum of (i) the Liquidation Preference specified for such share Series A2 Preferred Stock and (ii) all
declared but unpaid dividends (if any) on such share of Series A2 Preferred Stock. If upon the
Liquidation Event, the assets of the Corporation legally available for distribution to the holders of
the Series A2 Preferred Stock are insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full
amounts specified in this Section 3(a), then the entire assets of the Corporation legally available for
distribution shall be distributed with equal priority and pro rata among the holders of the Series A2
Preferred Stock in proportion to the full amounts they would otherwise be entitled to receive
pursuant to this Section 3(a).

(b) Series A Liquidation Preference. After payment or the setting aside for
payment in full of the amounts specified in Section 3(a) above, the holders of Series A Preferred

800325 v5/HN -4-
Stock shall be entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any Distribution of any of the assets of
the Corporation to the holders of the Common Stock by reason of their ownership of such stock, an
amount per share for each share of Series A Preferred Stock held by them equal to the sum of (i) the
Liquidation Preference specified for such share of Series A Preferred Stock and (ii) all declared but
unpaid dividends (if any) on such share of Series A Preferred Stock. If upon the Liquidation Event,
the assets of the Corporation legally available for distribution to the holders of the Series A Preferred
Stock are insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full amounts specified in this
Section 3(b), then the entire assets of the Corporation legally available for distribution shall be
distributed with equal priority and pro rata among the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock in
proportion to the full amounts they would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to this Section
3(b).

(c) Remaining Assets. After the payment or setting aside for payment to the
holders of Preferred Stock of the full amounts specified above, the entire remaining assets of the
Corporation legally available for distribution shall be distributed pro rata to holders of the Common
Stock of the Corporation in proportion to the number of shares of Common Stock held by them.

(d) Shares not Treated as Both Preferred Stock and Common Stock in any
Distribution. Shares of Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to be converted into shares of Common

Stock in order to participate in any Distribution, or series of Distributions, as shares of Common
Stock, without first foregoing participation in the Distribution, or series of Distributions, as shares of
Preferred Stock.

(e} Reorganization. For purposes of this Section 3, a “Liquidation Event” shall
be deemed to be occasioned by, or to include, (a) the acquisition of the Corporation by another entity
by means of any transaction or series of related transactions to which the Corporation is party
(including, without limitation, any stock acquisition, reorganization, merger or consolidation but
excluding any sale of stock for capital raising purposes) other than a transaction or series of
transactions in which the holders of the voting securities of the Corporation outstanding immediately
prior to such transaction continue to retain (either by such voting securities remaining outstanding or
by such voting securities being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity), as a result of
shares in the Corporation held by such holders prior to such transaction, at least fifty percent (50%)
of the total voting power represented by the voting securities of the Corporation or such surviving
entity outstanding immediately after such transaction or series of transactions; (b) an exclusive
license of all or substantially all of the Corporation’s intellectual property assets or a sale, lease or
other conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, in each case in a
transaction or series of transactions; or (c) any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary. A Liquidation Event may be waived by the holders
of at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the then-outstanding shares of Preferred Stock of the
Corporation, voting together as a single class on an as-converted to Common Stock basis.

(f) Reorganization Process. In the event that the Company is a party to a
reorganization deemed to be a Liquidation Event (as defined in Section 3(e) above), then each holder
of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, for each share of Preferred Stock then held, out of the
proceeds of such reorganization, only the greater of (i) the amount of cash, securities or other
property to which such holder would be entitled to receive in a Liquidation Event pursuant to

800325 v5/HN -5-
Section 3(a) above or (ii) the amount of cash, securities or other property to which such holder
would be entitled to receive in a Liquidation Event with respect to such shares if such shares had
been converted to Common Stock immediately prior to such reorganization, but in no event shall a
holder of Preferred Stock be entitled to receive both of the amounts set forth in subsections (i) and
(ii) of this Section 3(f).

(g) Valuation of Non-Cash Consideration. If any assets of the Corporation
distributed to stockholders in connection with a Liquidation Event are other than cash, then the value
of such assets shall be their fair market value as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors,
except that any publicly-traded securities to be distributed to stockholders in a Liquidation Event
shall be valued as follows:

{i) If the securities are then traded on a national securities exchange or the
Nasdaq Stock Market (or a similar national quotation system), then the value of the securities shall
be deemed to be the lesser of (a) the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange
or system over the ten (10) trading day period ending five (5) trading days prior to the Distribution
or (b) the closing price the day prior to the announcement of the Liquidation Event;

(11) if the securities are actively traded over-the-counter, then the value of
the securities shall be deemed to be the lesser of (a) the average of the closing prices of the securities
on such exchange or system over the ten (10) trading day period ending five (5) trading days prior to
the Distribution or (b) the closing price the day prior to the announcement of the Liquidation Event.

In the event of a merger or other acquisition of the Corporation by another entity, the Distribution
date shall be deemed to be the date such transaction closes.

For the purposes of this subsection 3(f), “trading day” shall mean any day which the exchange or
system on which the securities to be distributed are traded is open and “closing prices” or “closing
bid prices” shall be deemed to be: (1) for securities traded primarily on the New York Stock
Exchange or Nasdaq, the last reported trade price or sale price, as the case may be, at 4:00 p.m., New
York time, on that day and (ii) for securities listed or traded on other exchanges, markets and
systems, the last reported sales price as of the end of the regular hours trading period for such
exchange, market or system. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if after the date hereof, the closing
price as of the end of the regular hours trading period for any relevant exchange, market or system as
of a given trading day shall be determined in a different manner than as set forth above, then the fair
market value shall be determined to be the closing price of the stock as of such other established end
of the regular hours trading period for such exchange, market, or system. However, if the definitive
agreement for a Liquidation Event values the securities to be received by the Corporation’s
stockholders based on different time periods from those set forth above, the fair market value shall
be determined as of the time periods set forth in such definitive agreement, notwithstanding anything
in this subsection 3{f) to the contrary.

4. Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as
follows:

800325 vS/HN -6-
(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the
option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share at the office of the
Corporation or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, into that number of fully-paid,
nonassessable shares of Common Stock determined by dividing the Original Issue Price for the
relevant series by the Conversion Price for such series. (The number of shares of Common Stock
into which each share of Preferred Stock of a series may be converted is hereinafter referred to as the
“Conversion Rate” for each such series.) Upon any decrease or increase in the Conversion Price
for any series of Preferred Stock, as described in this Section 4, the Conversion Rate for such series
shall be appropriately increased or decreased.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be
converted into fully-paid, non-assessable shares of Common Stock at the then effective Conversion
Rate for such share (i) immediately prior to the closing of a firm commitment underwritten initial
public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the “Securities Act”), covering the offer and sale of the Corporation’s Common Stock,
provided that the offering price per share is not less than $3.00 (as adjusted for Recapitalizations)
and the aggregate gross proceeds to the Corporation are not less than Forty Million dollars
($40,000,000), or (i1) upon the receipt by the Corporation of a written request for such conversion
from the holders of at least sixty percent (60%) of the Preferred Stock of the Corporation, together as
a single class on an as-converted to common stock basis, or, if later, the effective date for conversion
specified in such requests (each of the events referred to in (i) and (11) are referred to herein as an
“Automatic Conversion Event’).

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be
issued upon conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder
would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the
then fair market value of a share of Common Stock as determined by the Board of Directors. For
such purpose, all shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder of Preferred Stock shall be
aggregated, and any resulting fractional share of Common Stock shall be paid in cash. Before any
holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into full shares of Common Stock, and
to receive certificates therefor, he shall either (A) surrender the certificate or certificates therefor,
duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock or
(B) notify the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or
destroyed and execute an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation
from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates, and shall give written notice to the
Corporation at such office that he elects to convert the same; provided, however, that on the date of
an Automatic Conversion Event, the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted
automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the
certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent;
provided further, however, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing
the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such Automatic Conversion Event unless either the
certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are delivered to the Corporation or its transfer
agent as provided above, or the holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such
certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the
Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such
certificates. On the date of the occurrence of an Automatic Conversion Event, each holder of record

800325 vS/HN -7-
of shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion, notwithstanding that the certificates representing such shares of
Preferred Stock shall not have been surrendered at the office of the Corporation, that notice from the
Corporation shall not have been received by any holder of record of shares of Preferred Stock, or
that the certificates evidencing such shares of Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered to
such holder.

The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after such delivery, or after such agreement and
indemnification, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as
aforesaid and a check payable to the holder in the amount of any cash amounts payable as the result
of a conversion into fractional shares of Common Stock, plus any declared and unpaid dividends on
the converted Preferred Stock. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately
prior to the close of business on the date of delivery of the notice of conversion set forth above, and
the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion
shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on
such date; provided, however, that if the conversion is in connection with an underwritten offer of
securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act or a merger, sale, financing, or liquidation of the
Corporation or other event, the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering Preferred
Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing of such transaction or upon the occurrence of
such event, in which case the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such
conversion of the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until
immediately prior to the closing of such transaction or the occurrence of such event.

(d) Adjustments to Conversion Price for Diluting Issues.

(i) Special Definition. For purposes of this paragraph 4(d), “Additional
Shares of Common” shall mean all shares of Common Stock issued (or, pursuant to paragraph
4(d)(iii), deemed to be issued) by the Corporation after the filing of this Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, other than issuances or deemed issuances of:

(1) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable upon conversion of the
Preferred Stock;

(2) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable to officers, directors
and employees of, or consultants to, the Corporation pursuant to stock grants, option plans, purchase
plans or other employee stock incentive programs or arrangements approved by the Board of
Directors (including the approval of the directors elected solely by the holders of the Preferred
Stock), or upon exercise of options or warrants granted to such parties pursuant to any such plan or
arrangement;

(3) shares of Common Stock issued upon the exercise or conversion of
Options or Convertible Securities outstanding as of the date of the filing of this Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation;

800325 vS/HN -8-
(4) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable as a dividend or
distribution on Preferred Stock or pursuant to any event for which adjustment is made pursuant to
paragraph 4(e), 4(f) or 4(g) hereof;

(5) shares of Common Stock issued in a registered public offering
under the Securities Act;

(6) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable pursuant to the
acquisition of another corporation by the Corporation by merger, purchase of substantially all of the
assets or other reorganization or to a joint venture agreement, provided, that such issuances are
approved by the Board of Directors (including the approval of the directors elected solely by the
holders of the Preferred Stock);

(7) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable to banks, equipment
lessors or other financial institutions pursuant to a debt financing or commercial leasing transaction
approved by the Board of Directors (including the approval of the directors elected solely by the
holders of the Preferred Stock);

(8) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable in connection with
sponsored research, collaboration, technology license, development, OEM, marketing or other
similar agreements or strategic partnerships approved by the Board of Directors (including the
approval of the directors elected solely by the holders of the Preferred Stock),

(9) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable to suppliers or third
party service providers in connection with the provision of goods or services pursuant to transactions
approved by the Board of Directors (including the approval of the directors elected solely by the
holders of the Preferred Stock); and

(10) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable in a transaction
approved by the holders of at least sixty percent (60%) of the Preferred Stock of the Corporation,
voting together as a single class on an as-converted to common stock basis.

(ii) No Adjustment of Conversion Price. No adjustment in the Conversion
Price of a particular series of Preferred Stock shall be made in respect of the issuance of Additional
Shares of Common unless the consideration per share (as determined pursuant to paragraph 4(d)(v))
for an Additional Share of Common issued or deemed to be issued by the Corporation is less than
the Conversion Price in effect on the date of, and immediately prior to such issue, for such series of
Preferred Stock.

(iii) Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall issue any Options or
Convertible Securities or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of
securities entitled to receive any such Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum number
of shares (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto without regard to any provisions contained
therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of
such Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities, the conversion or exchange of such

800325 v5/HN -9-
Convertible Securities or, in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such
Options and the conversion or exchange of the underlying securities, shall be deemed to have been
issued as of the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close
of business on such record date, provided that in any such case in which shares are deemed to be
issued:

(1) no further adjustment in the Conversion Price of any series of
Preferred Stock shall be made upon the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities or shares of
Common Stock in connection with the exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities;

(2) if such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms provide,
with the passage of time or otherwise, for any change in the consideration payable to the Corporation
or in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange
thereof (other than a change pursuant to the anti-dilution provisions of such Options or Convertible
Securities such as this Section 4(d) or pursuant to Recapitalization provisions of such Options or
Convertible Securities such as Sections 4(e), 4(f) and 4(g) hereof), the Conversion Price of the
Preferred Stock and any subsequent adjustments based thereon shall be recomputed to reflect such
change as if such change had been in effect as of the original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence
of the record date with respect thereto);

(3) no readjustment pursuant to clause (2) above shall have the effect
of increasing the Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock to an amount above the Conversion
Price that would have resulted from any other issuances of Additional Shares of Common and any
other adjustments provided for herein between the original adjustment date and such readjustment
date;

(4) upon the expiration of any such Options or any rights of
conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have been exercised, the
Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon the
occurrence of a record date with respect thereto) and any subsequent adjustments based thereon
shall, upon such expiration, be recomputed as if:

a) in the case of Convertible Securities or Options for
Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common issued were the shares of Common Stock, if
any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities and the consideration received therefor was the consideration actually
received by the Corporation for the issue of such exercised Options plus the consideration actually
received by the Corporation upon such exercise or for the issue of all such Convertible Securities
which were actually converted or exchanged, plus the additional consideration, if any, actually
received by the Corporation upon such conversion or exchange, and

b) in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, only the
Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thercof were issued at the time of
issue of such Options, and the consideration received by the Corporation for the Additional Shares of
Common deemed to have been then issued was the consideration actually received by the

800325 v5/HN -10-
Corporation for the issue of such exercised Options, plus the consideration deemed to have been
received by the Corporation (determined pursuant to Section 4(d)(v)) upon the issue of the
Convertible Securities with respect to which such Options were actually exercised; and

(5) if such record date shall have been fixed and such Options or
Convertible Securities are not issued on the date fixed therefor, the adjustment previously made in
the Conversion Price which became effective on such record date shall be canceled as of the close of
business on such record date, and thereafter the Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this
paragraph 4(d)(1ii) as of the actual date of their issuance.

(iv) Adjustment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional Shares
of Common. In the event this Corporation shall issue Additional Shares of Common (including
Additional Shares of Common deemed to be issued pursuant to paragraph 4(d)(iii)) without
consideration or for a consideration per share less than the applicable Conversion Price of Preferred
Stock in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such issue, then, the Conversion Price of the
Preferred Stock shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest
cent) determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall
be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the
number of shares which the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for the total number
of Additional Shares of Common so issued would purchase at such Conversion Price, and the
denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to such issue plus the number of such Additional Shares of Common so issued.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Conversion Price shall not be reduced at such time if the amount
of such reduction would be less than $0.01, but any such amount shall be carried forward, and a
reduction will be made with respect to such amount at the time of, and together with, any subsequent
reduction which, together with such amount and any other amounts so carried forward, equal $0.01
or more in the aggregate. For the purposes of this Subsection 4(d)(iv), all shares of Common Stock
issuable upon conversion of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock and the exercise and/or
conversion of any other outstanding Convertible Securities and all outstanding Options shall be
deemed to be outstanding.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this subsection 4(d),
the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for the issue (or deemed issue) of any
Additional Shares of Common shall be computed as follows:

(1) Cash and Property. Such consideration shall:

a) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the aggregate
amount of cash received by the Corporation before deducting any reasonable discounts,
commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the Corporation for any underwriting or
otherwise in connection with such issuance;

b) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair market value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors; and

800325 v5/HN -l1-
c) in the event Additional Shares of Common are issued
together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for consideration which
covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in clauses (a)
and (b) above, as reasonably determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(2) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per share
received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common deemed to have been issued pursuant
to paragraph 4(d)(i11) shall be determined by dividing

(x) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Corporation as
consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the minimum aggregate
amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to
any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration) payable to the
Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options for
Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities by

(y) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set forth in the
instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent
adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities.

(e) Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of Common Stock. In the
event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided (by stock split, by payment of a
stock dividend or otherwise), into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion

effectiveness of such subdivision, be proportionately decreased. In the event the outstanding shares
of Common Stock shall be combined (by reclassification or otherwise) into a lesser number of shares
of Common Stock, the Conversion Prices in effect immediately prior to such combination shall,

classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a

800325 v5/HN -12-
subdivision or combination of shares provided for above), then, in any such event, in lieu of the
number of shares of Common Stock which the holders would otherwise have been entitled to receive
each holder of such Preferred Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such shares of Preferred
Stock into a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock which a holder of the number of
shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of such series of Preferred Stock immediately
before that change would have been entitled to receive in such reorganization or reclassification, all
subject to further adjustment as provided herein with respect to such other shares.

(h) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation at its expense shall
promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish
to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and
showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation
shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be
furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and readjustments, (ii) the
Conversion Price at the time in effect and (iii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the
amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon the conversion of
Preferred Stock.

to the contrary, any downward adjustment of the Conversion Price of Preferred Stock may be waived
by the consent or vote of the holders of at least sixty percent (60%) of the Preferred Stock of the
Corporation, voting together as a single class on an as-converted to common stock basis, either
before or after the issuance causing the adjustment.

(j) Notices of Record Date. In the event that this Corporation shall propose at

(ii) to effect any reclassification or recapitalization of its Common Stock
outstanding involving a change in the Common Stock; or

(iii) — to voluntarily liquidate or dissolve or to enter into any transaction
deemed to be a Liquidation Event pursuant to Section 3(e);

then, in connection with each such event, this Corporation shall send to the holders of the Preferred
Stock at least 10 days’ prior written notice of the date on which a record shall be taken for such
Distribution (and specifying the date on which the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled thereto
and, if applicable, the amount and character of such Distribution) or for determining rights to vote in
respect of the matters referred to in (ii) and (111) above.

800325 vS/HN -13-
Such written notice shall be given by first class mail (or express courier), postage prepaid, addressed
to the holders of Preferred Stock at the address for each such holder as shown on the books of the
Corporation and shall be deemed given on the date such notice is mailed.

The notice provisions set forth in this section may be shortened or waived prospectively or
retrospectively by the vote or written consent of the holders of at least sixty percent (60%) of the
Preferred Stock of the Corporation, voting together as a single class on an as-converted to common
stock basis.

(k) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at all
times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock solely

for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock, such number of its
shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then
outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding
shares of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion
ofits counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such
number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.

(1) Special Mandatory Conversion in Connection with Series A2 Financing. If, at
any time after the filing of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Filing
Date’), the Corporation consummates the final sale and issuance of shares of its Series A2 Preferred
Stock (a “Series A2 Financing”) pursuant to terms of a Series A2 Preferred Stock Purchase
Agreement dated as of a date on or after the Filing Date (the “Series A2 Purchase Agreement”),
then, effective upon the date of a determination by the Company’s Board of Directors (the ‘Special
Mandatory Conversion Date”) that (1) such Series A2 Financing is complete and (11) that one or
more investors (each, a ‘“Defaulting Investor’) in the Series A2 Financing failed to purchase all of
the shares of Series A2 Preferred Stock that such investor or investors committed to purchase at any
closing pursuant to the Series A2 Purchase Agreement (the “Series A2 Commitment”), then a
portion of such Defaulting Investors’ outstanding shares of Series A2 Preferred Stock and Series A
Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the then applicable
Conversion Rate for such Series A2 Preferred Stock and Series A Preferred Stock, and a portion of
any securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of Series A2 Preferred Stock or Series A
Preferred Stock held by such Defaulting Investors (“Conversion Securities”) shall be converted into
securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of Common Stock at the then applicable
Conversion Rate for such Series A2 Preferred Stock or Series A Preferred Stock. The portion of
each Defaulting Investor’s shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series A2 Preferred Stock and
Conversion Securities converted into Common Stock pursuant to this Section 4(1) shall be equal to a
fraction, the numerator of which shall be such Defaulting Investor’s Series A-2 Commitment minus
the number of shares of Series A2 Preferred actually purchased by such Defaulting Investor, and the
denominator of which shall be such Defaulting Investor’s Series A2 Commitment.

The holder of any shares of Series A2 Preferred Stock or Series A Preferred Stock, or of
securities convertible or exercisable for shares of Series A2 Preferred Stock or Series A Preferred
Stock, converted pursuant to this Section 4(1) shall deliver to the Corporation during regular business
hours, at the office of any transfer agent of the Corporation for such Series A2 Preferred Stock or

800325 vS/HN -14-
Series A Preferred Stock, or at such other place as may be designated by the Corporation, the
certificate or certificates representing the shares or securities so converted, duly endorsed or assigned
in blank or to the Corporation. As promptly thereafter as is practicable, the Corporation shall issue
and deliver to such holder, at the place designated by such holder, a certificate or certificates for the
number of full shares of Common Stock or securities convertible or exercisable for shares of
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled. The person in whose name the certificate for such
shares of Common Stock or securities convertible or exercisable for shares of Common Stock is to
be issued pursuant to this Section 4(1) shall be deemed to have become a holder of such Common
Stock or securities convertible or exercisable for Common Stock, as the case may be, upon the Series
A2 and Series A Special Mandatory Conversion Date, and the shares of Series A2 Preferred Stock
and Series A Preferred Stock to be converted pursuant to this Section 4(1) shall be deemed to have
been cancelled and converted at such time without any requirement of further action on the part of
the stockholder whose shares are so converted.
