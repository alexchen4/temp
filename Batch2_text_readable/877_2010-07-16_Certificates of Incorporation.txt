otherwise by written notice given to the Corporation at least 30 days prior to the effective date of any
such event:

(A) a merger or consolidation in which
(1) the Corporation is a constituent party or
(2) a subsidiary of the Corporation is a constituent party

and the Corporation issues shares of its capital stock pursuant to such merger or
consolidation,

except any such merger or consolidation involving the Corporation or a subsidiary in
which the shares of capital stock of the Corporation outstanding immediately prior to
such merger or consolidation continue to represent, or are converted or exchanged for
shares of capital stock which represent, immediately following such merger or
consolidation at least a majority, by voting power, of the capital stock of (1) the
surviving or resulting corporation or (2) if the surviving or resulting corporation is a
wholly owned subsidiary of another corporation immediately following such merger
or consolidation, the parent corporation of such surviving or resulting corporation
(provided that, for the purpose of this Subsection 2(fYi). all shares of Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of options, warrants or other rights to acquire Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation or upon conversion of
securities convertible into, or exchangeable for Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to such merger or consolidation shall be deemed to be outstanding
immediately prior to such merger or consolidation and, if applicable, converted or

-4-
191973
exchanged in such merger or consolidation on the same terms as the actual
outstanding shares of Common Stock are converted or exchanged); or

(B) the sale, license, lease, transfer or other disposition, in a
single transaction or series of related transactions, by the Corporation or any
subsidiary of the Corporation of all or substantially all the assets of the Corporation
and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, except where such sale. lease, license, transfer
or other disposition is to a wholly owned subsidiary of the Corporation.

(il) The Corporation shall not have the power to effect any transaction
constituting a Deemed Liquidation Event unless the agreement or plan of merger, consolidation or sale of
assets provides that the consideration payable to the Corporation or its stockholders, shall be allocated
among and paid (after provision for the obligations of the Corporation in the case of a Deemed
Liquidation Event described in Subsection 2(f)(iMA)(2) or (B) above) to the holders of Preferred Stock of
the Corporation in accordance with Subsections 2(a) through (e) above so that holders of the Series D
Preferred Stock are paid the Series D Liquidation Amount, holders of the Series C Preferred Stock are
paid the Series C Liquidation Amount, the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock are paid the Series B
Liquidation Amount and the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are paid the Series A Liquidation
Amount.

(iii) If the consideration distributed by the Corporation or received by its
stockholders pursuant to this Section 2, or for any other purpose, is other than cash, its value will be
deemed its fair market value as collectively agreed, in good faith, by the Board of Directors and the
holders of at least 55% of the then outstanding Preferred Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
securities shall be valued as follows:

(A) Securities that are not subject to an investment letter or other
similar restrictions on free marketability (covered by clause (B) below):

(1) If traded on a securities exchange, the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on
such exchange over the thirty (30) day period ending three (3) days
prior to the closing of the Deemed Liquidation Event;

(2) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever
is applicable) over the thirty (30) day period ending three (3) days
prior to the closing of the Deemed Liquidation Event; and

(3) If there is no active public market, the value shall be
the fair market value thereof, as collectively determined, in good
faith. by the Board of Directors, the holders of at least 55% of the then
outstanding Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class on an
as-converted to Common Stock basis), or, if such determination
presents a conflict of interest which cannot otherwise be resolved, as
determined by a nationally or regionally recognized independent
appraisal firm selected by the Board of Directors and reasonably
acceptable to the holders of at least 55% of the then outstanding
Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class on an as-converted
to Common Stock basis).

-5-
191973
(B) The method of valuation of securities that are subject to an
investment letter or other similar restrictions on free marketability (other than
restrictions arising solely by virtue of a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former
affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount from the market value determined
as above in subparts (A)(1). (2) or (3) to reflect the approximate fair market value
thereof, as collectively determined, in good faith, by the Board of Directors and the
holders of at least 55% of the then outstanding Preferred Stock (voting together as a
single class), or, if such determination presents a conflict of interest which cannot
otherwise be resolved, as determined by a nationally or regionally recognized
independent appraisal firm selected by the Board of Directors and reasonably
acceptable to the holders of at least 55% of the then outstanding Preferred Stock
(voting together as a single class on an as-converted to Common Stock basis).

(C) The foregoing methods for valuing non-cash consideration to
be distributed in connection with a Deemed Liquidation Event may be superceded by
any determination of such value set forth in definitive agreements approved by at
least a majority of the members of the Board of Directors (including each of the
Preferred Directors) that govern such Deemed Liquidation Event.

(iv) Compliance. In the event the requirements of this Section 2(e) are
not complied with, the Corporation shall forthwith either:

(A) cause the closing of any Deemed Liquidation Event to be
postponed until such time as the requirements of this Section 2 have been complied
with; or

(B) cause any Deemed Liquidation Event to be rescinded and

cancelled, in which event the rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of the
Preferred Stock shall revert to and be the same as such rights, preferences and
privileges existing immediately prior to the date of such transaction.

(v) Notice. The Corporation shall give each holder of record of
Preferred Stock written notice of any impending Deemed Liquidation Event not later than twenty (20)
days prior to the stockholders’ meeting called to approve such Deemed Liquidation Event. or thirty (30)
days prior to the closing of such Deemed Liquidation Event, whichever is earlier, and shall also notify
such holders in writing of the final approval of such Deemed Liquidation Event. The first of such notices
shall describe the material terms and conditions of the impending Deemed Liquidation Event and the
provisions of this Section 2, and the Corporation shall thereafter give such holders prompt notice of any
material changes. The Deemed Liquidation Event shall in no event take place sooner than thirty (30) days
after the Corporation has given the first notice provided for herein or sooner than five (5) business days
after the Corporation has given notice of material changes provided for herein; provided, however. that
such periods may be shortened upon the written consent of the holders of at least 55% of the then
outstanding Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class on an as-converted to Common Stock basis.

3. Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have the following conversion
rights (the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Conversion Rate. The “Conversion Rate” in effect at any time for the
Series A Preferred Stock (the “Series A Conversion Rate”) shall be the quotient obtained by dividing
$1.00 per share of Series A Preferred Stock by the applicable Series A Conversion Price in effect at the
time of conversion. The Series A Conversion Price shall as of the Filing Date be $0.9248 per share,

-6-
191973
subject to adjustment as provided below (the “Series A Conversion Price”). The Conversion Rate in
effect at any time for the Series B Preferred Stock (the “Series B Conversion Rate’) shall be the quotient
obtained by dividing $1.30 per share of Series B Preferred Stock by the applicable Series B Conversion
Price in effect at the time of conversion. The Series B Conversion Price shall as of the Filing Date be
$1.1543 per share, subject to adjustment as provided below (the “Series B Conversion Price’). The
Conversion Rate in effect at any time for the Series C Preferred Stock (the “Series C Conversion Rate”)
shall be the quotient obtained by dividing $0.68 per share of Series C Preferred Stock by the applicable
Series C Conversion Price in effect at the time of conversion. The Series C Conversion Price shall as of
the Filing Date be $0.68 per share, subject to adjustment as provided below (the “Series C Conversion
Price’). The Conversion Rate in effect at any time for the Series D Preferred Stock (the “Series D
Conversion Rate”) shall be the quotient obtained by dividing $0.68 per share of Series D Preferred Stock
by the applicable Series D Conversion Price in effect at the time of conversion. The Series D Conversion
Price shall initially be $0.68 per share, subject to adjustment as provided below (the “Series D Conversion
Price”).

(b) Optional Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible
at any time, at the option of the holder thereof, into such shares of fully paid and nonassessable Class A
Common Stock at the then applicable Conversion Rate for such series of Preferred Stock.

(c) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be converted
automatically into shares of Class A Common Stock at the then effective Conversion Rate for such series
of Preferred Stock (i) upon the election, by vote or written consent, of the holders of at least sixty percent
(60%) of the outstanding Preferred Stock (on an as-converted to Common Stock basis); or (ii)
immediately prior to the closing of a firm commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, covering the offer and sale
of Common Stock to the public for the account of the Corporation so long as (A) the price to the public
per share is at least $3.00 (subject to appropriate adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends,
combinations and other similar recapitalizations affecting such shares) and (B) the net proceeds to the
Corporation (after payment of underwriting commissions and discounts, and offering expenses) is at least
$35,000,000 (such an offering that meets the requirements of this subsection (ii) being referred to as a
“Qualified Public Offering”).

(d) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shal] be
entitled to convert the same into Class A Common Stock and to receive certificates therefor, such holder
shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of
any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock (or, if the holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent
that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, such holder shall execute an agreement
satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection
with such certificates in lieu of providing such certificates), and shall give written notice to the
Corporation at such office that such holder elects to convert the same; provided, however, that in the
event of an automatic conversion pursuant to Section 3(c) above, the outstanding Preferred Stock shall be
converted automatically without any further action by the holders of such stock effective upon
consummation of the events set forth in Section 3(c)(i), or at the time described in Section 3(c){ii), as the
case may be, and whether or not the certificates representing such shares of stock are surrendered to the
Corporation or its transfer agent, and provided further that the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue
certificates evidencing the Class A Common Stock issuable upon such automatic conversion unless the
certificates evidencing such Preferred Stock are either delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent as
provided above or the holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been
Jost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the
Corporation from any joss incurred by it in connection with such certificates. The Corporation shail, as
soon as practicable after such delivery, or such agreement and indemnification in the case of a lost

-7-
191973

certificate, issue and deliver to such holder of Preferred Stock a certificate or certificates for the number
of shares of Class A Common Stock to which the holder shall be entitled and a check payable to the
holder in the amount of any cash payable as the result of a conversion into any fraction of a share of Class
A Common Stock. An optional conversion pursuant to Section 3{b) shall be deemed to have been made
immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the certificate(s) representing
the Preferred Stock to be converted (or the lost certificate indemnity agreement), and the person or
persons entitled to receive the Class A Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for
all purposes as the record holder or holders of such Class A Common Stock on such date.

(e) Fractional Shares of Stock. In lieu of any fractional share of Class A
Common Stock to which the holder of Preferred Stock would otherwise be entitled upon conversion, the
Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair market value of one share of Class
A Common Stock as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. Whether or not a fractional
share of stock is issuable upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of
shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder at the time of conversion into Class A Common Stock and
the number of shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon such aggregate conversion.

(f) Adjustment to Conversion Price. The Conversion Price for each series of
Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows: provided that, except in
connection with adjustments pursuant to Section 3(f)(iiC)(3). Section 3(fiiC)(4) and Section 3(A(v)
(which shall be subject to the limits set forth therein), any such adjustment shall not have the effect of
increasing the Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock to an amount which exceeds the Conversion
Price of such series of Preferred Stock, as applicable, existing immediately prior to such adjustment:

{i) Issuances for Consideration Less than Conversion Price,

(A) If at any time after the Filing Date, the Corporation shall
issue (or, pursuant to Section 3(f}(ii(C) hereof, shall be deemed to have issued) any Common Stock other
than Excluded Stock (as defined in Section 3(A(iii) below) for a consideration per share of stock less than
the Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series C Conversion Price, as the case may
be, in effect immediately prior to the issuance or deemed issuance of such Common Stock (excluding
stock dividends. subdivisions. split-ups, combinations, dividends or recapitalizations which are covered
by Sections 3(f(iv), (v) and (vi)), the Series A Conversion Price, the Series B Conversion Price, or the
Series C Conversion Price, as the case may be, in effect immediately before each such issuance shall upon
such issuance (except as set forth in Section 3(f(i)(C) or as otherwise provided in this Section 3(f}) be
adjusted to a price equal to the quotient obtained by dividing:

QQ) an amount equal to the sum of (a) the total number
of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance or deemed issuance
(assuming conversion of all Preferred Stock into Class A Common Stock at the then effective Conversion
Rate for the applicable series) multiplied by the Conversion Price of such series in effect immediately
prior to such issuance plus (b) the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation upon such
issuance or deemed issuance, by

(2) the total number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such issuance or deemed issuance (assuming conversion of all Preferred
Stock into Class A Common Stock at the then effective Conversion Rate for the applicable series) plus
the number of shares of Common Stock actually issued (or deemed to have been issued) in the transaction
which resulted in the adjustment pursuant to this Section 3(A)(i).

191973
(B) If at any time after the Filing Date, the Corporation shall
issue (or, pursuant to Section 3(f)(ii)(C) hereof, shall be deemed to have issued) any Commer >> te ott
than Excluded Stock (as defined in Section 3(fiii} below) for a car-*4r > tae =
the Series D Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the
Common Stock (excluding stock dividends, subdivisions, s
recapitalizations which are covered by Sections 3(f)(iv), (v) and |
effect immediately before each such issuance shall upon such issi
this Section 3(f}) be reduced to the consideration per share receive
or deemed issuance; provided that if such issuance or deemed issuu..-- nus wer ee CUnsrucrauUn, Len ine
Corporation shall be deemed to have received an aggregate consideration of $.001 per share issued or
deemed to be issued,

(C) Notwithstanding Section 3(f(i)(A), except with respect to
the Series D Sale (as defined in Section 3A(a)(i) and to which this Section 3(f)(i(C) shall not apply), in
no event shall the Proportionate Adjustment pursuant to this Section 3(f)(i) in the Series A Conversion

Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series C Conversion Price resulting from any sale of Common Stock
exceed the Proportionate Adjustment in the Series D Conversion Price, and to the extent the Proportionate
Adjustment in the Series D Conversion Price is less than the Proportionate Adjustment of any such series
derived by applying Section 3(f)(i(A), the Conversion Price of such series shall instead be adjusted to a
price equal to the quotient of the Conversion Price of such series in effect immediately prior to such
issuance divided by the Proportionate Adjustment in the Series D Conversion Price. For such purposes,
the *Proportionate Adjustment” of any series of Preferred Stock shall be equal to the Conversion Price of
such series in effect immediately before such issuance or deemed issuance divided by Conversion Price in
effect immediately after such issuance or deemed issuance as computed in accordance with Section

3(f)(i)(A) or (B).

(ii) For purposes of any adjustment of any Conversion Price pursuant to
Section 3(f(i), the following provisions shall be applicable:

(A) In the case of the issuance (or deemed issuance pursuant to
Section 3(f)(ii)(C)) of Common Stock for cash, the consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of
cash paid therefor before deducting any underwriting discounts or commissions paid or incurred by the
Corporation in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

(B) In the case of the issuance (or deemed issuance pursuant to
Section 3(fii¢C)) of Common Stock for consideration. in whole or in part, other than cash, the
consideration other than cash shall be deemed to be the fair market value thereof, as determined by the
Board of Directors, irrespective of generally accepted accounting treatment.

(C) In the case of the issuance of (a) options to purchase or
rights to subscribe for Common Stock (other than Excluded Stock), (b) securities by their terms
convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock (other than Excluded Stock) or (c) options to
purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or exchangeable securities:

(1) the aggregate maximum number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable upon exercise of such options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common
Stock shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such options or rights were issued (assuming the
satisfaction of any conditions to exercisability, including without limitation, the passage of time, but
without taking into account potential anti-dilution adjustments) and for a consideration equa! to the
consideration (determined in the manner provided in clauses (A) and (B) above), if any, received by the

-9-
191973
Corporation upon the issuance of such options or rights plus the minimum purchase price provided in
such options or rights for the Common Stock covered thereby:

(2) the aggregate maximum number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of or in exchange for any such convertible or exchangeable
securities, or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or
exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof (assuming the satisfaction of any
conditions to conversion or exercisability in each case, including without limitation, the passage of time,
but without taking into account potential anti-dilution adjustments), shall be deemed to have been issued
at the time such securities were issued or such options or rights were issued and for a consideration equal
to the consideration received by the Corporation for any such securities and related options or rights
(excluding any cash paid on account of accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the additional
minimum consideration, if any, to be received by the Corporation upon the conversion or exchange of
such securities or the exercise of any related options or rights (the consideration in each case to be
determined in the manner provided in clauses (A) and (B) above);

(3) on any change in the number of shares of Common
Stock deliverable upon exercise of any such options or rights or conversion of or exchange for such
convertible or exchangeable securities, or on any change in the minimum purchase price of such options,
rights or securities, (excluding changes resulting from the antidilution provisions of such options, rights
or securities), each applicable Conversion Price shal! forthwith be readjusted to such Conversion Price as
would have been obtained had the adjustment made upon (a) the issuance of such options, rights or
securities not exercised, converted or exchanged prior to such change or (b) the options or rights related to
such securities not converted or exchanged prior to such change, as the case may be, been made upon the
basis of such change: and

(4) on the expiration of any such options or rights, the
termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options or rights related to
such convertible or exchangeable securities, each applicable Conversion Price shal! forthwith be
readjusted to such Conversion Price as would have been obtained had the adjustment made upon the
issuance of such options, rights, convertible or exchangeable securities or options or rights related to such
convertible or exchangeable securities, as the case may be. been made upon the basis of the issuance of
only the number of shares of Common Stock actually issued upon the exercise of such options or rights,
upon the conversion or exchange of such convertible or exchangeable securities or upon the exercise of
the options or rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, as the case may be.

(D) In the case of any option or convertible security with respect
to which the maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise or conversion or
exchange thereof is not determinable, no adjustment to any Conversion Price shall be made unti] such
number becomes determinable.

(E) In the event the Corporation shall issue on more than one
date additional shares of Common Stock that are a part of one transaction or a series of related
transactions and that would result in an adjustment to the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred
Stock pursuant to the terms of Section 3(f(i). and such issuance dates occur within a period of no more
than 360 days from the first such issuance to the final such issuance then, upon the final such issuance,
the Conversion Price of such series shall be readjusted to give effect to all such issuances as if they
occurred on the date of the first such issuance (and without giving effect to any additional adjustments as
a result of any such subsequent issuances within such period).

(ili) As used herein, “Excluded Stock” shall mean:

merger or acquisition that is approved by the Board of Directors. provided that such plan or arrangement
is approved by all of the Preferred Directors;

or Series B Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 1.2(d) of that certain Share Purchase Agreement, dated
July 16, 2010, among the Corporation and the investors party thereto (the “Purchase Agreement”).

(iv) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If the Corporation shall
at any time or from time to time after the Filing Date effect a subdivision of the outstanding Common

Stock without a comparable subdivision of any series of Preferred Stock, or combine the outstanding
shares of any series of Preferred Stock without a comparable combination of the Common Stock. the
Conversion Price of the applicable series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately before that subdivision
or combination shall be proportionately decreased so that the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be increased in proportion to such increase in the
aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. If the Corporation shall at any time or from
time to time after the Filing Date combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock without a comparable
combination of any series of Preferred Stock, or effect a subdivision of the outstanding shares of any
series of Preferred Stock without a comparable subdivision of the Common Stock, the Conversion Price
of the applicable series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately before the combination or subdivision
shall be proportionately increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion

Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Filing Date shall make or issue. or fix a record date
for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution

Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately before such event shall be
decreased as of the time of such issuance or, in the event such a record date shall have been fixed, as of
the close of business on such record date, by multiplying the applicable Conversion Price then in effect by
a fraction:

(A) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of
business on such record date, and

(B) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares
of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of
business on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such
dividend or distribution: provided, however, that if such record date shall have been fixed and such
dividend is not fully paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the
Conversion Price of each such series of Preferred Stock shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close
of business on such record date and thereafter the Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this
subsection as of the time of actual payment of such dividends or distributions: and provided further.
however, that no such adjustment shall be made if the holders of Preferred Stock simultaneously receive
(i) a dividend or other distribution of shares of Common Stock in a number equal to the number of shares
of Common Stock as they would have received if all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock of the
applicable series had been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event or (ii) a dividend or
other distribution of shares of Preferred Stock which are convertible, as of the date of such event, into
such number of shares of Common Stock as is equal to the number of additional shares of Common Stock
being issued with respect to each share of Common Stock in such dividend or distribution.

(vi) Reorganization; Reclassification, Merger: Consolidation. Subject to
the provisions of Section 2(c). in the event, at any time after the Filing Date, of any capital reorganization,

consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into another person, each series of Preferred Stock, as
applicable, shall, after such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation or merger, be convertible into
the kind and number of shares of capital stock or other securities or property of the Corporation or
otherwise to which the holders of such Preferred Stock would have been entitled if immediately prior to
such reorganization, reclassification. consolidation or merger such holder had converted his or its
Preferred Stock into Common Stock; and, in such case, appropriate adjustment (as determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation) shall be made in the application of the provisions in
this Section 3 with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the holders of the Preferred Stock, to the
end that the provisions set forth in this Section 3 (including provisions with respect to changes in and
other adjustments of the Conversion Price) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be,
in relation to any securities or other property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of the Preferred
Stock The provisions of this clause (vi) shall similarly apply to successive reorganizations,
reclassifications, consolidations or mergers.

191973
(g) Miscellaneous.

(i) Rounding. All calculations under Section 3(f) shall be made to the
nearest cent or to the nearest one hundredth (1/100) of a share of stock, as the case may be.

(ii) Minimal Adjustments. No adjustment in the Conversion Price of any
series of Preferred Stock need be made if such adjustment would result in a change in such Conversion
Price of less than $0.01. Any adjustment of less than $0.0! that is not made shall be carried forward and
shall be made at the time of and together with any subsequent adjustment that, on a cumulative basis,
amounts to an adjustment of $0.01 or more in the such Conversion Price.

(iii) Certificate_as_to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each
adjustment or readjustment of the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock pursuant to this
Section 3, the Corporation, at its expense, shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in
accordance with the terms hereof and prepare and furnish to each holder of affected Preferred Stock a
certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in reasonable detail the facts upon
which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon written request at any time
of any holder of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting
forth (A) all such adjustments and readjustments, (B) the Conversion Price in effect at such time for each
series of Preferred Stock, and (C) the number of shares of Class A Common Stock and the amount, if any,
of other property which at the time would be received upon the conversion of such holder's Preferred
Stock.

(iv) Notices of Record Date. In the event of any taking by the
Corporation of a record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders
thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend or other distribution. any right to subscribe for, purchase
or otherwise acquire any shares of stock of any class or any other securities or property or receive any
other right, the Corporation shall mail to each holder of Preferred Stock at least twenty (20) days prior to
such record date a notice specifying the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of
such dividend, distribution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right.

(v) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation
shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued Class A Common Stock.

Class A Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding
Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of shares of authorized but unissued Class A Common
Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding Preferred Stock, the
Corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase
its authorized but unissued Class A Common Stock to such number of shares of stock as shall be
sufficient for such purpose. All Class A Common Stock which shall be so issued shall be duly and
validly issued and fully paid and nonassessable and free from all taxes, liens and charges with respect to
the issue thereof, and. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Corporation will from time to
time take all such action as may be requisite to assure that the par value per share of the Common Stock is
at al! times equal to or less than the lowest Conversion Price in effect at that time. The Corporation will
take all such actions as may be necessary to assure that all such Class A Common Stock may be so issued
without violation of any applicable law or regulation, or of any requirement of any national securities
exchange upon which the Class A Common Stock may be listed. The Corporation will not take any
action which results in any adjustment of any Conversion Price if the total number of shares of Class A
Common Stock issued or issuable after such action upon conversion of the Preferred Stock would exceed
the total number of shares of Class A Common Stock then authorized by this Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation.

Corporation’s books.

(vii) Reissuance of Converted Stock. No shares of Preferred Stock that
have been converted into Class A Common Stock after the original issuance thereof shall ever again be
reissued and all such shares of stock so converted shall, upon such conversion, cease to be a part of the
authorized shares of stock of the Corporation.

(viii) Waiver_of Adjustment to Conversion Price. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary. any downward adjustment of the Conversion Price of any series of

Preferred Stock may be waived, either prospectively or retroactively and either generally or in a particular
instance, by the vote or written consent of the holders of at least fifty-five percent (55%) of the
outstanding Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class (on an as-converted to Common Stock
basis); provided, however, that no waiver of any such downward adjustment shall be made with respect to
any series of Preferred Stock unless there is also an equivalent waiver of downward adjustment of the
Conversion Price of all series of Preferred Stock. Any such waivers shall bind all future holders of the
applicable series of Preferred Stock, as the case may be, with respect to such adjustment or adjustments
and shall be effective only with respect to the adjustment or adjustments specified in the resolution or
written consent of the holders of Preferred Stock.

(ix) Termination of Conversion Rights. In the event of a redemption of
any share of Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 5 hereof, the Conversion Rights of the shares designated
for redemption shall terminate at the close of business on the last full day preceding the applicable
Redemption Date, unless the redemption price is not paid on such Redemption Date, in which case the
Conversion Rights for such shares shall continue until such price is paid in full. In the event of a Deemed
Liquidation Event, the Conversion Rights shall terminate at the close of business on the last full day
preceding the date fixed for payment of any such amounts distributable on such event to the holders of the

committing to purchase on the Milestone Closing a number of shares of Series D Preferred Stock at least
equal to one-half (50%) of the shares it purchases at the Initial Closing, then the Applicable Portion (as
defined below) of the shares of each series of Preferred Stock (other than Series D Preferred Stock) held

-14-
191973
then the Applicable Portion of the shares of Preferred Stock (other than Series D Preferred Stock) held by
such holder shall automatically, and without any further action on the part of such holder, be converted at
the relevant Conversion Rate applicable to the shares to be converted in effect immediately prior to the
Initial Closing into shares of Class A Common Stock effective upon and concurrently with the Second
Closing or in the event that the Second Closing does not occur within thirty (30) days after the Initial
Closing, at the close of business on such thirtieth day.

(iii) In the event that any holder of shares of Preferred Stock participates in
the Series D Sale but does not purchase on or before the Milestone Closing an aggregate number of shares

recalculated upon completion of the Milestone Closing, and to the extent the Applicable Portion upon
completion of the Milestone Closing is larger than the Applicable Portion calculated pursuant to clauses
(i) and (ii) above. then the Applicable Portion (calculated as of completion of the Milestone Closing) of
all shares of each series of Preferred Stock (other than Series D Preferred Stock) held by such holder, less
any shares converted pursuant to subsection (i) and subsection (ii) above, shall automatically. and without
any further action on the part of such holder, be converted at the relevant Conversion Rate applicable to
the shares to be converted in effect immediately prior to the Initial Closing into shares of Class A
Common Stock concurrently with Milestone Closing.

(iv) In the event that any holder of shares of Preferred Stock participates in
the Series D Sale, but does not purchase at the Milestone Closing a number of shares of Series D
Preferred Stock equal to 50% or more of the number of shares of Series D Preferred Stock it has

shall automatically, and without any further action on the part of such holder, be converted at the relevant
Conversion Rate applicable to the Series D Preferred Shares in effect immediately prior 10 the Milestone
Closing into shares of Class A Common Stock concurrently with Milestone Closing; provided, however,
that if any such holder has purchased. on or before the Milestone Closing, at least such holder's Pro Rata
Amount, then only the Exchange Shares acquired in the Series B Exchange shall be automatically
converted into Class A Common Stock pursuant to this Section 3A(a)(iv).

(A) “Applicable Portion” shall mean, with respect to any holder of
shares of Preferred Stock, (x) as of the Initial Closing or the Second Closing, a number of shares of each

which is equal to the amount, if positive, by which two thirds (2/3) of such holder’s Pro Rata Amount
exceeds the number of shares of Series D Preferred Stock actually purchased by such holder at or prior to
such time, and the denominator of which is equal to two thirds (2/3) of such holder’s Pro Rata Amount,
and (y) as of the Milestone Closing, a number of shares of each series of Preferred Stock calculated by
multiplying the aggregate number of shares of such series of Preferred Stock held by such holder
immediately prior to the Initial Closing by a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the amount, if

provided that all shares of Preferred Stock held by such Affiliates are also aggregated with such holder’s
shares for purposes of determining the number of shares of Preferred Stock owned by the holder in
calculating such holder's Pro Rata Amount and Applicable Portion (and provided that no shares or

Stock represented by such surrendered certificate and not converted pursuant to Subsection 3A(a). Such
converted Preferred Stock shall be retired and cancelled and may not be reissued as shares of such series,

as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Preferred Stock (including any series
thereof) accordingly.

4, Voting Rights.

(a) General Voting Rights. Each holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled
