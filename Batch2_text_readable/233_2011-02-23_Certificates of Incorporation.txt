contingencies (the “Initial Consideration”) shall be allocated among the holders of capital stock

consideration which becomes payable to the stockholders of the Corporation upon release from

Series of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive proceeds from such Distribution pursuant to
this Section 3 until the aggregate consideration such Series would receive under this Section 3 is
less than the aggregate consideration such series would have received had such series been
converted to Common Stock immediately prior to the Liquidation Event, at which point such
Series will automatically be deemed to have converted to Common Stock immediately prior to
the Liquidation Event and all further consideration for such Series will be calculated on an as-

Corporation immediately prior to such merger or consolidation continue to hold at least 50% of
the voting power of the capital stock of the Corporation or the surviving or acquiring entity),
(iii) the closing of the transfer (whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise), in one
transaction or a series of related transactions, to a person or group of affiliated persons (other
than an underwriter of the Corporation's securities), of the Corporation’s securities if, after such
closing, such person or group of affiliated persons would hold 50% or more of the outstanding
voting stock of the Corporation (or the surviving or acquiring entity) or (iv) the closing of the
sale, lease, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Corporation’s assets. The

to effect a Liquidation Event referred to in Section 3.7(ii) unless the agreement or plan of merger
or consolidation for such transaction provides that the consideration payable to the stockholders
of the Corporation shall be allocated among the holders of capital stock of the Corporation in
accordance with Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3.

3.9 Non-Cash Consideration. If any assets of the Corporation distributed to
stockholders in connection with any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation
are other than cash, then the value of such assets shall be their fair market value as determined by

the thirty (30) day period ending three (3) days prior to the distribution; and

(ii) if (i) above does not apply but the securities are actively
traded over-the-counter, then, unless otherwise specified in a definitive agreement for the
acquisition of the Corporation, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid
prices over the thirty (30) calendar day period ending three (3) trading days prior to the
distribution; and

(iii) _if there is no active public market as described in clauses (i)
or (ii) above, then the value shall be the fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by

receive Common Stock upon conversion of their Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have
converted such shares of Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of the
Corporation’s securities in the offering,

GDSVF&HM254945.7 10
(c) In the event of a notice of redemption of any shares of Preferred
Stock pursuant to Section 7, the right of the shares designated for redemption to convert into
Common Stock shall terminate at the close of business on the last full day preceding the date
fixed for redemption, unless the redemption price is not fully paid on such redemption date, in
which case such right for such shares shall continue until such Price is paid in full.

5.2 Automatic Conversian.

(a) Each share of Preferred Stock shal! automatically be converted into
fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock, as provided herein: (i) immediately prior
to the closing of a firm commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective
registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, covering the offer and
sale of Common Stock for the account of the Corporation (an “IPO”) in which the aggregate
public offering price equals or exceeds Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000) and the per share
public offering price equals or exceeds an amount that is three (3) times the Original Issue Price
(before deduction of underwriters’ discounts and commissions) for the Series B Preferred Stock
(as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations or the like); or
(ii) immediately prior to the closing of an IPO that does not meet the aggregate public offering
price or per share public offering price requirements set forth in Section 5.2(a) if the Corporation
receives the written consent of the holders of at least sixty-five percent (65%) of the then
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (voting as a single class on an as converted to Common
Stock basis) to the conversion of all then outstanding Preferred Stock under this Section 5.

(b) Upon the occurrence of any event specified in subparagraph 5.2(a)
(i) or (ii) above, the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted into Common Stock
automatically without the need for any further action by the holders of such shares and whether
or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer
agent; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates
evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion unless the certificates
evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are either delivered to the Corporation or its transfer
agent as provided below, or the holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such
certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the
Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such
certificates. Upon the occurrence of such automatic conversion of the Preferred Stock, the
holders of Preferred Stock shall surrender the certificates representing such shares at the office of
the Corporation or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock or Common Stock. As soon as
practicable thereafter, there shall be issued and delivered to such bolder at such office and in its
name as shown on such surrendered certificate or certificates, a certificate or Certificates for the
number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Preferred Stock surrendered were
convertible on the date on which such automatic conversion occurred,

5.3 Conversion Price. Each share of Preferred Stock Shall be convertible in
accordance with subsection 5.1 or subsection 5.2 above into the number of shares of Common
Stock which results from dividing the Original Issue Price for such series of Preferred Stock by
the conversion price for such series of Preferred Stock that is in effect at the time of conversion
(the “Conversion Price”). The initial Conversion Price for each such series of Preferred Stock

GDSVF&HM254945,7 11
shall be the Original Issue Price for such series of Preferred Stock. The Conversion Price of each
series of the Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided below.
Following each adjustment of the Conversion Price, such adjusted Conversion Price shall remain
in effect until a further adjustment of such Conversion Price hereunder.

5.4 Adjustment Upon Common Stock Event. Upon the happening of a

Common Stock Event (as hereinafter defined), the Conversion Price of each such series of
Preferred Stock shall, simultaneously with the happening of such Common Stock Event, be
adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock in effect
immediately prior to sech Common Stock Event by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which shall be
the number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to such
Common Stock Event, and (ii) the denominator of which shalt be the number of shares of
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately after such Common Stock Event, and the
product so obtained shall thereafter be the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock.
The Conversion Price for a series of Preferred Stock shall be readjusted in the same manner upon
the happening of each subsequent Common Stock Event. As used herein, the term the “Comunon
Stock Event’ shall mean at any time or from time to time after the date upon which this Restated
Cextificate of Incorporation is accepted for filing by the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware (the “Filing Date"), (i) the issue by the Corporation of additional shares of Common
Stock as a dividend or other distribution on outstanding Common Stock, (ii) a subdivision of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, or (iii) a
combination of the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares of
Common Stock.

5.5 Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. If at any time or from

time to time after the Filing Date the Corporation pays a dividend or makes another distribution
to the holders of the Common Stock payable in securities of the Corporation, other than an event
constituting a Common Stock Event, then in each such event provision shall be made so that the
holders of the Preferred Stock shall receive upon conversion thereof, in addition to the number of
shares of Commen Stock receivable upon conversion thereof, the amount of securities of the
Corporation which they would have been entitled to receive had their Preferred Stock been
converted into Common Stock on the date of such event (or such record date, as applicable) and
had they thereafter, during the period from the date of such event (or such record date, as
applicable) to and including the conversion date, retained such securities receivable by them as
aforesaid during such period, subject to all other adjustments called for during such period under
this Section 5 with respect to the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock or with respect to
such other securities by their terms; provided, however, that no such adjustment shall be made if
the holders of Preferred Stock simultaneously receive a dividend or other distribution of such
securities, cash or other property in an amount equal to the amount of such securities as they
would have received if all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock had been converted into
Common Stock on the date of such event.

5.6 Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. If at any time

or from time to time after the Filing Date the Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the
Preferred Stock is changed into the same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of
stock, whether by recapitalization, reclassification or otherwise (other than by a Common Stock

GDSVF&H\I254945.7 12

TT TR eS RL SR ST me mY RR Ye CN eR ee eer Me ere pg einen
Event or a stock dividend, reorganization, merger, or consolidation provided for elsewhere in this
Section 5), then in any such event each holder of Preferred Stock shall have the right thereafter to
convert such stock into the kind and amount of stock and other securities and property receivable
upon such recapitalization, reclassification or other change by holders of the number of shares of
Common Stock into which such shares of Preferred Stock could have been converted
immediately prior to such recapitalization, reclassification or change, all subject to further
adjustment as provided herein or with respect to such other securities or property by the terms
thereof.

5.7 Reoganizations, Mergers and Consolidations. If at any time or from time

to time after the Filing Date there is a reorganization of the Corporation (other than a
recapitalization, subdivision, combination, reclassification or exchange of shares provided for
elsewhere in this Section 5) or a merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into another
corporation (subject to Section 3.7), then, as a part of such reorganization, merger or
consolidation, provision shall be made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock thereafter shall
be entitled to receive, upon conversion of the Preferred Stock, the number of shares of stock or
other securities or property of the Corporation, or of such successor corporation resulting from
such reorganization, merger or consolidation, to which a holder of Common Stock deliverable
upon conversion of the Preferred Stock immediately prior to such Teorganization, merger or
consolidation would have been entitled to receive on such reorganization, merger or
consolidation. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the
provisions of this Section 5 with respect to the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock after
the reorganization, merger or consolidation to the end that the provisions of this Section 5
(cluding adjustment of the Conversion Price then in effect and number of shares issuable upon
conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event and be as nearly equivalent
to the provisions hereof as may be practicable. This subsection 5.7 shall similarly apply to
successive reorganizations, mergers and consolidations. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Section 5, if any reorganization, merger or consolidation is approved
by the vote of stockholders required by Section 6 hereof, then such transaction and the rights of
the holders of Preferred Stock and Common Stock pursuant to such reorganization, merger or
consolidation will be governed by the documents entered into in connection with such transaction
and not by the provisions of this Section 5.7.

5.8 Sale of Shares Below Conversion Price.

(a) Adjustment Formula. If at any time or from time to time after the
Filing Date the Corporation issues or sells, or is deemed by the provisions of this subsection 5.8
to have issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock (as hereinafter defined), otherwise
than in connection with a Common Stock Event as provided in subsection 5.4, a dividend or
distribution as provided in subsection 5.5, a recapitalization, reclassification or other change as
provided in subsection 5.6, or a reorganization, merger or consolidation as provided in subsection
5.7, for an Effective Price (as hereinafter defined) that is Jess than the Conversion Price for a
series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such issue or sale (or deemed issue or
sale), then, and in each such case, the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock shall be
reduced, as of the close of business on-the date of such issue or sale, to the price obtained by
multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction:

GOSVP&HV254945.7 13
(i) The numerator of which shall be the sum of (A) the number
of Common Stock Equivalents Outstanding (as hereinafter defined) immediately prior to such
issue or sale of Additional Shares of Common Stock plus (B) the quotient obtained by dividing
the Aggregate Consideration Received (as hereinafter defined) by the Corporation for the total
number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued or sold (or deemed so issued and sold)
by the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such
issue or sale; and

(ii) | The denominator of which shall be the sum of (A) the
number of Common Stock Equivalents Outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale of
Additional Shares of Common Stock plus (B) the number of Additional Shares of Common
Stock so issued or sold (or deemed so issued and sold).

(bo) Certain Definitions. For the purpose of making any adjustment
required under this subsection 5.8:

(i) — The “Additional Shares of Common Stock’ shall mean all
shares of Common Stock issued by the Corporation, or deemed issued as provided in Section
5.8(c) below, whether or not subsequently reacquired or retired by the Corporation, other than:

approved by the vote of the holders of at least sixty-five percent (65%) of the Preferred Stock,
voting together as a single class on an as converted to Common Stock basis, as being excluded
from the definition of “Additional Shares of Common Stock” under this subparagraph 5.8(b).

(ii) The “Aggregate Consideration Received” by the
Corporation for any issue or sale (or deemed issue or sale) of securities shall (A) to the extent it
consists of cash, be computed at the gross amount of cash received by the Corporation before
deduction of any underwriting or similar commissions, compensation or concessions paid or
allowed by the Corporation in connection with such issue or sale and without deduction of any
expenses payable by the Corporation, but excluding any amounts paid or payable for accrued
interest; (B) to the extent it consists of property other than cash, be computed at the fair market
value of that property as determined in good faith by the Board; and (C) if Additional Shares of
Common Stock, Convertible Securities or Rights or Options to purchase either Additional Shares
of Common Stock or Convertible Securities are issued or sold together with other stock or
securities or other assets of the Corporation for a consideration which covers both, be computed
as the portion of the consideration so received that may be reasonably determined in good faith
by the Board to be allocable to such Additional Shares of Common Stock, Convertible Securities

(v) The “Effective Price” of Additional Shares of Common
Stock shall mean the quotient determined by dividing the total number of Additional Shares of
Common Stock issued or sold, or deemed to have been issued or sold, by the Corporation under
this subsection 5.8, into the Aggregate Consideration Received, or deemed to have been received,
by the Corporation under this subsection 5.8, for the issue of such Additional Shares of Common
Stock; and

(vi) The “Rights or Options” shall mean warrants, options or
other rights to purchase or acquire shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities.

(c) Deemed Issuances, For the purpose of making any adjustment to
the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock required under this subsection 5.8, if the
Corporation issues or sells any Rights or Options or Convertible Securities and if the Effective
Price of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Rights or Options and/or the
conversion or exchange of Convertible Securities (computed without reference to any additional
or similar protective or antidilution clauses) is less than the Conversion Price then in effect for a
series of Preferred Stock, then the Corporation shall be deemed to have issued, at the time of the
issuance of such Rights, Options or Convertible Securities, that number of Additional Shares of

issuance of such Rights or Options or Convertible Securities, plus, in the case of such Rights or
Options, the minimum amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Corporation upon the
exercise in full of such Rights or Options, plus, in the case of Convertible Securities, the
minimum amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Corporation (other than by
cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities) upon the
conversion or exchange thereof; provided that:

(i) if the minimum amounts of such consideration cannot be
ascertained, but are a function of antidilution or similar protective clauses, then the Corporation
shall be deemed to have received the minimum amounts of consideration without reference to
such clauses;

(ii) if the minimum amount of consideration payable to the
Corporation upon the exercise of Rights or Options or the conversion or exchange of Convertible
Securities is reduced over time or upon the occurrence or non-occurrence of specified events
other than by reason of antidilution adjustments, then the Effective Price shall be recalculated
using the figure to which such minimum amount of consideration is reduced; and

(iii) if the minimum amount of consideration payable to the
Corporation upon the exercise of such Rights or Options or the conversion or exchange of
Convertible Securities is subsequently increased, then the Effective Price shall again be
recalculated using the increased minimum amount of consideration payable to the Corporation
upon the exercise of such Rights or Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities.

GDSVF&H\I254945,7 16

No further adjustment of the Conversion Price, adjusted upon the issuance of such Rights or
Options or Convertible Securities, shall be made as a result of the actual issuance of shares of
Common Stock on the exercise of any such Rights or Options or the conversion or exchange of
any such Convertible Securities. If any such Rights or Options or the conversion rights
represented by any such Convertible Securities shall expire without having been fully exercised,
then the Conversion Price as adjusted upon the issuance of such Rights or Options or Convertible
Securities shall be readjusted to the Conversion Price which would have been in effect had an
adjustment been mede on the basis that the only shares of Common Stock so issued were the
shares of Common Stock, if any, that were actually issued or sold on the exercise of such Rights
or Options or rights of conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, and such shares of
Common Stock, if any, were issued or sold for the consideration actually received by the
Corporation upon such exercise, plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the
Corporation for the granting of all such Rights or Options, whether or not exercised, plus the
consideration received for issuing or selling all such Convertible Securities actually converted or
exchanged, plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the Corporation (other than by
cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities) on the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, provided that such readjustment shall not
apply to prior conversions of Preferred Stock.

5.9 Multiple Closing Dates, In the event the Corporation shall issue on more
than one date Additional Shares of Common Stock that are a part of one transaction or a series of
related transactions and that would result in an adjustment to the Conversion Price for a series of
Preferred Stock pursuant to the terms of Section 5.8 then, upon the final such issuance, the
Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock shall be readjusted to give effect to all such
issuances as if they occurred on the date of the first such issuance (and without giving effect to
any additional adjustments as a result of any such subsequent issuances within such period).

5.10 Certificate of Adjustment. In each case of an adjustment or readjustment
of the Conversion Price for a series of Preferred Stock, the Corporation, at its expense, shall, as
promptly as reasonably practicable but in any event not later than 10 days thereafter, compute
such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the provisions hereof and prepare a
certificate showing such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which
such adjustment or readjustment is based, and shall mail such certificate, by first class mail,
postage prepaid, to each registered holder of the Preferred Stock at the holder's address as shown
in the Corporation’s books, —

5.11 Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued
upon any conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional share to which the holder
would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay the holder cash equal to the product of
such fraction multiplied by the Common Stock's fair market value as determined in good faith by
the Board as of the date of conversion. Whether or not fractional shares would be issuable upon
such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock
the holder is at the time converting into Common Stock and the aggregate number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion.

5.12 Effect of Conversion. All shares of Preferred Stock which shall have been
surrendered for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and
all rights with respect to such shares shall immediately cease and terminate upon the close of
business on the date of such surrender, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive
shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor, to receive payment in lieu of any fraction of a
share otherwise issuable upon such conversion as provided in Section 5.11. Any shares of
Preferred Stock so converted shall be retired and cancelled and may not be reissued as shares of
such series, and the Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate action (without the need for
stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Preferred
Stock accordingly.

3.13 Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at

all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock,
solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock, such
number of its shares of Common Stock as shal] from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate
action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose,
including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval
of any necessary amendment to this Restated Certificate of Incorporation. Before taking any
action which would cause an adjustment reducing the Conversion Price for a series of Preferred
Stock below the then par value of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such
series of Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take any corporate action which may, in the
opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Corporation may validly and legally issue
fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion Price.

3.14 Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Restated Certificate
of Incorporation to be given to the holders of shares of the Preferred Stock shall be deemed given
upon the earlier of actual receipt or deposit in the United States mail, by certified or registered
mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or delivery by a recognized express courier, fees
prepaid, addressed to each holder of record at the address of such holder appearing on the books
of the Corporation. ‘

5.15 Taxes. The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and other similar taxes
that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon
conversion of shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 5. The Corporation shall not,
however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in
the issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in which the
shares of Preferred Stock so converted were registered, and no stich issuance or delivery shall be
made unless and until the person or entity requesting such issuance has paid to the Corporation
the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax
has been paid. .

The Corporation wil] effect such redemptions by paying in cash in exchange for each series of
Preferred Stock the Original Issue Price of each such relevant series, in cluding declared but
unpaid dividends on such series (for each series, the “Redemption Price”). The Corporation
shall effect such redemption out of funds that are, or through the reasonable efforts of the
Corporation can be made, legally available for such purposes, in priority to any other scheduled
