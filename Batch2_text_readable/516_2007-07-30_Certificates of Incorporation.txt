if declared by the Board, out of any funds and assets of the Corporation legally available therefor,
noncumulative dividends at the annual Dividend Rates for the Series B Stock, Series B-1 Stock
and Series B-2 Stock, prior and in preference to the payment of any dividends on the Series A
Stock or the Common Stock in such calendar year (other than a Common Stock Dividend). No
dividends (other than a Common Stock Dividend) shall be paid with respect to the Series A
Stock or the Common Stock during any calendar year unless dividends in the total amount of the
annual Dividend Rates for the Series B Stock, the Series B-1 Stock and the Series B-2 Stock
shall have first been paid or declared and set apart for payment to the holders of the Series B
Stock, the Series B-1 Stock and the Series B-2 Stock during that calendar year; provided,
however, that this restriction shall not apply to Permitted Repurchases. Payments of any
dividends to the holders of the Series B Stock, the Series B-1 Stock and the Series B-2 Stock
shall be paid pro rata, on an equal priority, pari passu basis, in proportion to the payment each
such holder would receive if the full amount of such dividends had been paid.

(b) If, after the total amount of the annual Dividend Rates for
the Series B Stock, the Series B-1 Stock and the Series B-2 Stock shall have first been paid or
declared and set apart for payment to the holders of the Series B Stock, the Series B-1 Stock and
the Series B-2 Stock as specified in Section 2(a) above, the holders of the then outstanding Series
A Stock shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board, out of any funds and
assets of the Corporation legally available therefor, noncumulative dividends at the annual
Dividend Rate for such Series A Stock, prior and in preference to the payment of any dividends
on the Common Stock in such calendar year (other than a Common Stock Dividend). No
dividends (other than a Common Stock Dividend) shall be paid with respect to the Common
Stock during any calendar year unless dividends in the total amount of the annual Dividend Rate

-3-
MP1:1001488.3
for the Series A Stock shall have first been paid or declared and set apart for payment to the
holders of the Series A Stock, respectively, during that calendar year; provided, however, that
this restriction shall not apply to Permitted Repurchases. Payments of any dividends to the
holders of the Series A Stock shall be paid pro rata, on an equal priority, pari passu basis, in
proportion to the payment each such holder would receive if the full amount of such dividends
had been paid.

(c) Dividends on the Preferred Stock shall not be mandatory or
cumulative, and no rights or interest shall accrue to the holders of the Preferred Stock by reason
of the fact that the Corporation shall fail to declare or pay dividends on the Preferred Stock in the
amount of the respective annual Dividend Rate for each such series or in any other amount in any
calendar year or any fiscal year of the Corporation, whether or not the earnings of the Corpora-
tion in any calendar year or fiscal year were sufficient to pay such dividends in whole or in part.

2.2 Participation Rights. If, after dividends in the full preferential amounts
specified in this Section 2 for the Preferred Stock have been paid or declared and set apart in any
calendar year of the Corporation, the Board shall declare additional dividends out of funds legally
available therefor in that calendar year, then such additional dividends shall be declared pro rata
on the Common Stock and the Preferred Stock on a pari passu basis according to the number of
shares of Common Stock held by such holders, where each holder of shares of Preferred Stock is
to be treated for this purpose as holding the greatest whole number of shares of Common Stock
then issuable upon conversion of all shares of Preferred Stock held by such holder pursuant to
Section 6.

2.3. Non-Cash Dividends. Whenever a dividend provided for in this Section 2
shall be payable in property other than cash, the value of such dividend shall be deemed to be the
fair market value of such property as determined in good faith by the Board.

3. Liquidation Rights. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of
the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, the funds and assets that may be legally dis-
tributed to the Corporation’s stockholders (the “Available Funds and Assets”) shall be distrib-
uted to stockholders in the following manner.

3.1 Liquidation Preferences.

(a) The holders of each share of Series B Stock, Series B-1
Stock and Series B-2 Stock then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid, out of the Available
Funds and Assets, and prior and in preference to any payment or distribution (or any setting apart
of any payment or distribution) of any Available Funds and Assets on any shares of Series A
Stock or Common Stock, an amount per share equal to the respective Original Issue Price for the
Series B Stock, Series B-1 Stock and Series B-2 Stock (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock
dividends, recapitalizations or the like, with respect to such series of Preferred Stock), plus all
‘declared but unpaid dividends thereon. If upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation the Available Funds and Assets shall be insufficient to permit the payment to
holders of the Series B Stock, Series B-1 Stock and Series B-2 Stock of their full preferential
amounts described in this Section, then all the remaining Available Funds and Assets shall be

-4.

MP1:1001488.3
distributed among the holders of the then outstanding Series B Stock, Series B-1 Stock and
Series B-2 Stock pro rata, on an equal priority, pari passu basis, according to their respective
liquidation preferences as set forth herein.

(b) If there are any Available Funds and Assets remaining after
the payment or distribution (or the setting aside for payment or distribution) to the holders of the
Series B Stock, Series B-1 Stock and Series B-2 Stock as described by subsection (a) above of
this Section 3.1, then the holders of each share of Series A Stock then outstanding shall be
entitled to be paid, out of the Available Funds and Assets, and prior and in preference to any
payment or distribution (or any setting apart of any payment or distribution) of any Available
Funds and Assets on any shares of Common Stock, an amount per share equal to the respective
Original Issue Price for such Series A Stock (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends,
recapitalizations or the like, with respect to such Series A Stock), plus all declared but unpaid
dividends thereon. If upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation the
Available Funds and Assets shall be insufficient to permit the payment to holders of the Series A
Stock of their full preferential amounts described in this Section, then all the remaining Available
Funds and Assets shall be distributed among the holders of the then outstanding Series A Stock
pro rata, on an equal priority, pari passu basis, according to their respective liquidation
preferences as set forth herein.

3.2 Participation Rights. If there are any Available Funds and Assets remain-
ing after the payment or distribution (or the setting aside for payment or distribution) to the hold-
ers of the Preferred Stock of their full preferential amounts described above in this Section 3,
then all such remaining Available Funds and Assets shall be distributed among the holders of the
then outstanding Common Stock and the Preferred Stock pro rata according to the number of

‘ . shares of Common Stock held by such holders, where, for this purpose, holders of shares of Pre-

ferred Stock will be deemed to hold (in lieu of their Preferred Stock) the greatest whole number
of shares of Common Stock then issuable upon conversion in full of such shares of Preferred
Stock pursuant to Section 6.

3.3 Deemed Liquidation. Each of the following transactions shall be deemed
to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation as those terms are used in this
Section 3: (a) any consolidation or merger, including, but not limited to, any triangular merger, in
which the Corporation is a constituent entity or is a party or, in the case of a triangular merger, its
subsidiary is a constituent entity, in one transaction or series of related transactions (each, a
“combination transaction’’), if, as a result of such combination transaction, the voting securities
of the Corporation that are outstanding immediately prior to the consummation of such combina-
tion transaction (other than any such securities that are held by an “Acquiring Stockholder”, as
defined below) do not represent, or are not converted into, securities of the surviving entity of
such combination transaction (or such surviving entity’s parent entity if the surviving entity is
owned by the parent entity) that, immediately after the consummation of such combination trans-
action, together possess at least a majority of the total voting power of all securities of such sur-
viving entity (or its parent entity, if applicable) that are outstanding immediately after the con-
summation of such combination transaction, including securities of such surviving entity (or its
parent entity, if applicable) that are held by the Acquiring Stockholder; (b) any transaction or
series of related transactions as a result of which the owners of the Corporation's outstanding

-5-
MP1:1001488.3
voting securities immediately prior thereto do not own at least a majority of the outstanding
voting securities of the surviving entity; or (c) a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Corporation (determined on a consolidated basis with all of the Corporation’s direct and indirect
subsidiaries), whether such assets are sold by means of an asset sale, by means of a merger,
consolidation or sale of the stock of one or more of the subsidiaries of the Corporation, or
otherwise, that is followed by the distribution of the proceeds to the Company’s stockholders.
For purposes of this Section 3.3, an “Acquiring Stockholder” means a stockholder or
stockholders of the Corporation that (i) merges or combines with the Corporation in such
combination transaction or (ii) owns or controls a majority of another entity that merges or
combines with the Corporation in such combination transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing
or the provisions of Section 6.7 below, if any of the above described transactions are approved by

(a) the vote of the holders of at least the numbers of shares of
each class and series of Preferred Stock as are required by the protective provisions of Section 7
below or by any contact or agreement to which the Corporation is a party,

(b) a vote sufficient under the Delaware General Corporation
Law, this Certificate and the Bylaws of the Corporation, and

(c) — in the case of a transaction that alters the pari passu status
of the distribution of the Available Funds and Assets among the Series B Stock, Series B-1 Stock
and Series B-2 Stock, the vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66
2/3%) of the Series B-1 Stock, voting as a separate series, and the vote of the holders of at least
sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the Series B-2 Stock, voting as a separate series;

then such transaction and the rights of the holders of Common Stock and Preferred Stock will be
governed by the documents to be entered into in connection with such transaction.

3.4 Non-Cash Consideration. If any assets of the Corporation distributed to
stockholders in connection with any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation
are other than cash, then the value of such assets shal] be their fair market value as determined by
the Board of Directors in good faith, except that any securities to be distributed to stockholders in
a liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation shall be valued as follows.

3.4.1 The method of valuation of securities not subject to investment let-
ter or other similar restrictions on free marketability shall be as follows:

(a) unless otherwise specified in a definitive agreement for the
acquisition of the Corporation, if the securities are then traded on a national securities exchange
or the Nasdaq National Market (or a similar national quotation system), then the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange or system over
the thirty (30) day period ending three (3) days prior to the distribution; and

(b) if clause (a) above does not apply but the securities are
actively traded over-the-counter, then, unless otherwise specified in a definitive agreement for
the acquisition of the Corporation, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid

-6-
MP1:1001488.3
prices over the thirty (30) calendar day period ending three (3) trading days prior to the
distribution; and

(c) _ if there is no active public market as described in clauses (i)
or (ii) above, then the value shall be the fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by
the Board.

3.4.2 The method of valuation of securities subject to investment letter
or other restrictions on free marketability shall be to make an appropriate discount from the mar-
ket value determined as above in Sections 3.4.1(a), (b) or (c) to reflect the approximate fair mar-
ket value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board.

3.5 Postponement _or Cancellation of Transaction. In the event the
requirements of this Section 3 are not complied with, the Corporation shall forthwith either:

(a) cause the closing of such transaction to be postponed unti]
such time as the requirements of this Section 3 have been complied with; or

(b) cancel such transaction, in which event the rights,
preferences and privileges of the holders of the Preferred Stock shall revert to and be the same as
such rights, preferences and privileges existing immediately prior to the date of the first notice
referred to in subsection 3.6 below.

3.6 Notice of Transaction. The Corporation shall give each holder of record of
Preferred Stock written notice of such impending transaction not later than twenty (20) days prior
to the stockholders’ meeting called to approve such transaction, or twenty (20) days prior to the
closing of such transaction, whichever is earlier, and shall also notify such holders in writing of
the final approval of such transaction. The first of such notices shall describe the material terms
and conditions of the impending transaction and the provisions of this Section 3, and the
Corporation shall thereafter give such holders prompt notice of any material changes. The
transaction shall in no event take place sooner than twenty (20) days after the Corporation has
given the first notice provided for herein or sooner than ten (10) days after the Corporation has
given notice of any material changes provided for herein; provided, however, that, subject to
compliance with the Delaware General Corporation Law, such periods may be shortened or
waived upon the written consent of the holders of Preferred Stock that represent at least a
majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of such Preferred Stock (voting
together as a single class and not as separate series, and on an as-converted basis).

4. Redemption. Neither the Preferred Stock nor the Common Stock is redeemable.

5, Voting Rights.

5.1 Common Stock, Each holder of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled
to one (1) vote for each share thereof held.

§.2 Preferred Stock. Each holder of shares of Preferred Stock shall be entitled
to the number of votes equal to the number of whole shares of Common Stock into which such

-7-
MP1:1001488.3
shares of Preferred Stock could be converted pursuant to the provisions of Section 6 below at the
record date for the determination of the stockholders entitled to vote on such matters or, if no
such record date is established, the date such vote is taken or any written consent of stockholders
is solicited.

5.3 General. Subject to the other provisions of this Fourth Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation, each holder of Preferred Stock shall have full voting rights
and powers equal to the voting rights and powers of the holders of Common Stock, and shall be
entitled to notice of any stockholders’ meeting in accordance with the bylaws of the Corporation
(as in effect at the time in question) and applicable law, and shall be entitled to vote, together
with the holders of Common Stock, with respect to any question upon which holders of Common
Stock have the right to vote, except as may be otherwise provided by applicable law. Except as
otherwise expressly provided herein or as required by law, the holders of Preferred Stock and the
holders of Common Stock shall vote together and not as separate classes.

6. Conversion Rights, The outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be converti-
ble into Common Stock as follows.

6.1 Optional Conversion.

6.1.1 At the option of the holder thereof, each share of Preferred Stock
shall be convertible, at any time or from time to time, into fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Common Stock as provided herein.

6.1.2 Each holder of Preferred Stock who elects to convert the same into
shares of Common Stock shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at
the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock or Common Stock, and
shall give written notice to the Corporation at such office that such holder elects to convert the
same and shall state therein the number of shares of Preferred Stock being converted. Thereupon
the Corporation shal] promptly issue and deliver at such office to such holder a certificate or cer-
tificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled upon such
conversion and shall promptly pay (a) in cash or, to the extent sufficient funds are not then
legally available therefor, Common Stock (at the Common Stock’s fair market value determined
by the Board as of the date of such conversion), any declared and unpaid dividends on the shares
of Preferred Stock being converted and (b) in cash (at the Common Stock’s fair market value
determined by the Board as of the date of such conversion) the value of any fractional share of
Common Stock otherwise issuable to any holder of Preferred Stock. Such conversion shall be
deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surren-
der of the certificate or certificates representing the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted,
and the person entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion
shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such shares of Common Stock on such
date. If a conversion election under this Section 6.1 is made in connection with an underwritten
offering of the Corporation’s securities pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
(which underwritten offering does not cause an automatic conversion pursuant to Section 6.2 to
take place) the conversion may, at the option of the holder tendering shares of Preferred Stock for
conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of the Corpora-

-8-
MP1:1001488.3
tion’s securities pursuant to such offering, in which event the holders making such elections who
are entitled to receive Common Stock upon conversion of their Preferred Stock shall not be
deemed to have converted such shares of Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing
of such sale of the Corporation’s securities in the offering.

6.2 Automatic Conversion.

6.2.1 (a) Each share of Series B Stock, Series B-1 Stock and Series
B-2 Stock shall automatically be converted into fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common
Stock, as provided herein (i) immediately prior to the closing of a firm commitment underwritten
public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, covering the offer and sale of Common Stock for the account of the
Corporation in which the aggregate public offering price (before deduction of underwriters’
discounts and commissions) equals or exceeds Thirty Million Dollars ($30,000,000) and the
public offering price per share of which equals or exceeds Five Dollars ($5.00) per share before
deduction of underwriters’ discounts and commissions (such price per share of Common Stock to
be appropriately adjusted to reflect Common Stock Events (as defined in Section 6.4)) or (ii)
upon the Corporation’s receipt of the written consent of the holders of not less than seventy
percent (70%) of the then outstanding shares of Series B Stock, Series B-1 Stock and Series B-2
Stock to the conversion of all then outstanding Series B Stock, Series B-1 Stock and Series B-2
Stock under this Section 6.

(b) Each share of Series A Stock shall automatically be converted
into fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock, as provided herein (i) immediately
prior to the closing of a firm commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective
registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, covering the offer and
sale of Common Stock for the account of the Corporation in which the aggregate public offering
price (before deduction of underwriters’ discounts and commissions) equals or exceeds Thirty
Million Dollars ($30,000,000) and the public offering price per share of which equals or exceeds
Four Dollars and Sixty Cents ($4.60) per share before deduction of underwriters’ discounts and
commissions (such price per share of Common Stock to be appropriately adjusted to reflect
Common Stock Events (as defined in Section 6.4)) or (ii) upon the Corporation’s receipt of the
written consent of the holders of not less than sixty-seven percent (67%) of the then outstanding
shares of Series A Stock to the conversion of all then outstanding Series A Stock under this
Section 6.

6.2.2 Upon the occurrence of any event specified in subparagraph 6.2.1
(a) or (b) above, the outstanding shares of Series A Stock, Series B Stock, Series B-1 Stock or
Series B-2 Stock, as the case may be, shall be converted into Common Stock automatically
without the need for any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the
certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent;
provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the
shares of Commmon Stock issuable upon such conversion unless the certificates evidencing such
shares of Series A Stock, Series B Stock, Series B-1 Stock or Series B-2 Stock, as the case may
be, are either delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent as provided below, or the holder
notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or

; -9.
MP1:1001488.3
destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the
Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates. Upon the
occurrence of such automatic conversion of the Series A Stock, Series B Stock, Series B-1 Stock
or Series B-2 Stock, as the case may be, the holders of Series A Stock, Series B Stock, Series B-1
Stock or Series B-2 Stock, as the case may be, shall surrender the certificates representing such
shares at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock or Common
Stock, Thereupon, there shall be issued and delivered to such holder promptly at such office and
in its name as shown on such surrendered certificate or certificates, a certificate or certificates for
the-number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Series A Stock, Series B Stock,
Series B-1 Stock or Series B-2 Stock, as the case may be, surrendered were convertible on the
date on which such automatic conversion occurred, and any declared and unpaid dividends shall
be paid in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.1.2.

6.3. Conversion Price. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible in
accordance with Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 above into the number of shares of Common Stock
which results from dividing the Original Issue Price for such series of Preferred Stock by the
conversion price for such series of Preferred Stock that is in effect at the time of conversion (the
“Conversion Price”). The initial Conversion Price for each such series of Preferred Stock shall
be the Original Issue Price for such series of Preferred Stock. The Conversion Price of each
series of Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided below.
Following each adjustment of the Conversion Price, such adjusted Conversion Price shall remain
_ in effect until a further adjustment of such Conversion Price hereunder.

6.4 Adjustment Upon Common Stock Event. Upon the happening of a Com-
mon Stock Event (as defined below), the Conversion Price of each such series of Preferred Stock
shall, simultaneously with the happening of such Common Stock Event, be adjusted by multi-
plying the Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such
Common Stock Event by a fraction, (a) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to such Common Stock Event, and (b)
the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock issued and out-
standing immediately after such Common Stock Event, and the product so obtained shal] there-
after be the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock. The Conversion Price for a
series of Preferred Stock shall be readjusted in the same manner upon the happening of each sub-
sequent Common Stock Event. As used herein, the term the “Common Stock Event” shall mean -
at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date for a series of Preferred Stock (i)
the issue by the Corporation of additional shares of Common Stock as a dividend or other distri-
bution on outstanding Common Stock, (ii) a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common
Stock into a greater number of shares of Common Stock or (ii) a combination of the outstanding
shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock.

6.5 Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. If at any time or from
time to time after the Original Issue Date for a series of Preferred Stock the Corporation pays a
dividend or makes another distribution to the holders of the Common Stock payable in securities
of the Corporation, other than an event constituting a Common Stock Event, then in each such
event provision shall be made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock shall receive upon con-
version thereof, in addition to the number of shares of Common Stock receivable upon conver-

-10-
MP1:1001488.3
\

sion thereof, the amount of securities of the Corporation which they would have received had
their Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event (or such
record date, as applicable) and had they thereafter, during the period from the date of such event
(or such record date, as applicable) to and including the conversion date, retained such securities
receivable by them as previously stated during such period, subject to all other adjustments called
for during such period under this Section 6 with respect to the rights of the holders of the Pre-
ferred Stock or with respect to such other securities by their terms.

6.6 Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. If at any time
or from time to time after the Original Issue Date for a series of Preferred Stock the Common

Stock issuable upon the conversion of such series of the Preferred Stock is changed into the same
or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by recapitalization,
reclassification or otherwise (other than by a Common Stock Event or a stock dividend, reorgani-
zation, merger, or consolidation provided for elsewhere in this Section 6), then in any such event
each holder of such series of Preferred Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such stock
into the kind and amount of stock and other securities and property receivable upon such recapi-
talization, reclassification or other change by holders of the number of shares of Common Stock
into which such shares of such series of Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately
prior to such recapitalization, reclassification or change, all subject to further adjustment as pro-
vided herein or with respect to such other securities or property by the terms thereof.

6.7 Reorganizations, Mergers and Consolidations. If at any time or from time
to time after the Original Issue Date for a series of Preferred Stock there is a reorganization of the
Corporation (other than a recapitalization, subdivision, combination, reclassification or exchange
of shares provided for elsewhere in this Section 6) or a merger or consolidation of the Corpora-
tion with or into another corporation (except an event which is governed under Section 3.3), then,
as a part of such reorganization, merger or consolidation, provision shall be made so that the
holders of such series of Preferred Stock thereafter shall be entitled to receive, upon conversion
of such Preferred Stock, the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the
Corporation, or of such successor corporation resulting from such reorganization, merger or con-
solidation, to which a holder of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion would have been
entitled on such reorganization, merger or consolidation. In any such case, appropriate adjust-
ment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 6 with respect to the rights
of the holders of such series of Preferred Stock after the reorganization, merger or consolidation
to the end that the provisions of this Section 6 (including adjustment of the Conversion Price
then in effect and number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be
applicable after that event and be as nearly equivalent to the provisions hereof as may be practi-
cable. This Section 6.7 shall similarly apply to successive reorganizations, mergers and consoli-
dations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6, if any reorganiza-
tion, merger or consolidation is approved by the vote of stockholders as permitted by Section 3.3
or as required by Section 7 hereof, then such transaction and the rights of the holders of Preferred
Stock and Common Stock pursuant to such reorganization, merger or consolidation will be gov-
erned by the documents entered into in connection with such transaction and not by the provi-
sions of this Section 6.7.

6.8 Sale of Shares Below Conversion Price.

-ll-
MP1:1001488.3
6.8.1 Adjustment Formula. If at any time or from time to time after the
Original Issue Date for a series of Preferred Stock the Corporation issues or sells, or is deemed
by the provisions of this Section 6.8 to have issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock
(as defined below), otherwise than in connection with a Common Stock Event as provided in
Section 6.4, a dividend or distribution as provided in Section 6.5 or a recapitalization, reclassifi-
cation or other change as provided in Section 6.6, or a reorganization, merger or consolidation as
provided in Section 6.7 or 3.3, for an Effective Price (as defined below) that is less than the Con-
version Price for a series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such issue or sale (or
deemed issue or sale), then, and in each such case, the Conversion Price for such series of Pre-
ferred Stock shall be reduced, as of the close of business on the date of such issue or sale, to the
- price obtained by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction:

(a) The numerator of which shall be the sum of (i) the number
of Common Stock Equivalents Outstanding (as defined below) immediately prior to such issue or
sale of Additional Shares of Common Stock plus (ii) the quotient obtained by dividing the
Aggregate Consideration Received (as defined below) by the Corporation for the total number of
Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued or sold (or deemed so issued and sold) by the
Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such issue or
sale; and

(b) The denominator of which shall be the sum of (i) the num-
ber of Common Stock Equivalents Outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale plus (ii)
the number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued or sold (or deemed so issued and
sold). ;

Stock; and

(f) The “Rights or Options’ shall mean warrants, options or

the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock required under this Section 6.8, if the Cor-
poration issues or sells any Rights or Options or Convertible Securities and if the Effective Price
of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Rights or Options and/or the con-
version or exchange of Convertible Securities (computed without reference to any additional or
similar protective or antidilution clauses) is less than the Conversion Price then in effect for a
series of Preferred Stock, then the Corporation shall be deemed to have issued, at the time of the
issuance of such Rights, Options or Convertible Securities, that number of Additional Shares of
Common Stock that is equal to the maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
exercise or conversion of such Rights, Options or Convertible Securities upon their issuance and

amount equal to the total amount of the consideration, if any, received by the Corporation for the
issuance of such Rights or Options.or Convertible Securities, plus, in the case of such Rights or
Options, the minimum amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Corporation upon the
exercise in full of such Rights or Options, plus, in the case of Convertible Securities, the mini-

-14- )
MP1:1001488.3
mum amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Corporation (other than by cancellation of
liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities) upon the conversion or
exchange thereof; provided that:

(a) if the minimum amounts of such consideration cannot be
ascertained, but are a function of antidilution or similar protective clauses, then the Corporation
shall be deemed to have received the minimum amounts of consideration without reference to
such clauses;

(b) if the minimum amount of consideration payable to the
Corporation upon the exercise of Rights or Options or the conversion or exchange of Convertible
Securities is reduced over time or upon the occurrence or non-occurrence of specified events
other than by reason of antidilution or similar protective adjustments, then the Effective Price
shall be recalculated using the figure to which such minimum amount of consideration is
reduced; and

(c) if the minimum amount of consideration payable to the
Corporation upon the exercise of such Rights or Options or the conversion or exchange of
Convertible Securities is subsequently increased, then the Effective Price shall again be
recalculated using the increased minimum amount of consideration payable to the Corporation
upon the exercise of such Rights or Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities. "

No further adjustment of the Conversion Price, adjusted upon the issuance of such Rights or
Options or Convertible Securities, shall be made as a result of the actual issuance of shares of
Common Stock on the exercise of any such Rights or Options or the conversion or exchange of
any such Convertible Securities. If any such Rights or Options or the conversion rights repre-
sented by any such Convertible Securities shall expire without having been fully exercised, then
the Conversion Price as adjusted upon the issuance of such Rights or Options or Convertible
Securities shall be readjusted to the Conversion Price which would have been in effect had an
adjustment been made on the basis that the only shares of Common Stock so issued were the
shares of Common Stock, if any, that were actually issued or sold on the exercise of such Rights
or Options or rights of conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, and such shares of
Common Stock, if any, were issued or sold for the consideration actually received by the Corpo-
ration upon such exercise, plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the Corporation for
the granting of all such Rights or Options, whether or not exercised, plus the consideration
received for issuing or selling all such Convertible Securities actually converted or exchanged,
plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the Corporation (other than by cancellation of
liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities) on the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, provided that such readjustment shall not apply to prior
conversions of Preferred Stock.

6.9 Certificate of Adjustment. In each case of an adjustment or readjustment
of the Conversion Price for a series of Preferred Stock, the Corporation, at its expense, shall
cause its Chief Financial Officer to compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with
the provisions hereof and prepare a certificate showing such adjustment or readjustment, and

-15-
MP1:1001488.3
shall mail such certificate, by first class mail, postage prepaid, to each registered holder of the
Preferred Stock at the holder’s address as shown in the Corporation’s books.

6.10 Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued
upon any conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional share to which the holder
would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall. pay the holder cash equal to the product of
such fraction multiplied by the Common Stock’s fair market value as determined in good faith by
the Board as of the date of conversion.

“6.11 Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at
all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock,
solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock, such num-
ber of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conver-
sion of all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized
but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then
outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate action as may,
in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Com-
mon Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.
