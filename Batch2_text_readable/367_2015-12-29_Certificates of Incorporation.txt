practicable thereafter, issuc and deliver at such office to such holder of shares of Preferred Stock,
or to the nomince or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of
shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as provided
above. The Company shall promptly pay (i) in cash or, to the extent sufficient funds are not then

A0778835

Common Stock’s fair market value determined in good faith by the Board as of the date of
conversion) the valuc of any fractional share of Common Stock otherwise issuable to any holder
of Preferred Stock. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to
the close of business on the date of such surrender of the certificate or certificates representing
the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the
record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock as of such date.

3.3 Conversion Price Adjustments. The Conversion Price of the Series 2 Preferred,

immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock, then the applicable Conversion Price
of the applicable scrics of Antidilution Preferred in effect immediately prior to each such
issuance shall (cxccpt as otherwise provided in this clause (i)) be adjusted to an amount
determined by dividing (X) an amount equal to the sum of (a) the product derived by multiplying

shares of Common Stock (including shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued upon
conversion of the outstanding Preferred Stock or otherwise under Section 3.3(i)(E), with the
Series 6-A Preferred treated as being convertible into Common Stock (without actual
conversion) for this purpose) outstanding immediately prior to such issuance, plus (b) the
consideration, if any, reecived by or deemed to have been received by the Company upon such
issuance, by (Y) an amount equal to the sum of (a) the number of shares of Common Stock

deemed to have becn issued in such issuance.

(B) No adjustment of the applicable Conversion Price of the
Antidilution Preferred shall be made in an amount Jess than one cent per share, provided that any

taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. Except to the limited extent provided for in
Sections 3.3(i)(E)(3), 3.3(i)(E)(4) and 3.3(iv), no adjustment of the applicable Conversion Price
of the Antidilution Preferred shall have the effect of increasing the applicable Conversion Price

for a considcration equal to the consideration, if any, received by the Company for any such
securities and related options or rights (excluding any cash reccived on account of accrued
interest or accrued dividends), plus the additional consideration, if any, to be received by the
Company upon the conversion or exchange of such sccuritics or the exercise of any related
options or rights (the consideration in each case to be determined in the manner provided in
Sections 3.3(i)(C) and 3.3(i)(D));

(3) In the event of any change in the number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable upon exercise of such options or rights or upon conversion of or in
exchange for such convertible or exchangeable securities, including, but not limited to, a change
resulting from the antidilution provisions thereof, the applicable Conversion Price of the

(4) | Upon the expiration of any such options or rights, the
termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options or rights
related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the applicable Conversion Price of the

the event there are no shares of Preferred Stock outstanding other than the Series 6-A Preferred,
the ownership of shares of Series 6-A Preferred will not convcy to the holder thereof any right to
