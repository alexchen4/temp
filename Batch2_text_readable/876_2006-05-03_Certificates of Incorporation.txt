NINTH:
(a)

(b)

Each person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he is or was a
director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employce or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect
to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action
in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other
capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be
indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized
or permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as the
same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such
amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to
provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to
provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss
(including attomeys’ fees, judgments, fines, excise taxes or penalties and amounts
paid or to be paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred by such person
in connection with such action, suit or proceeding, and such indemnification shall
continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or
agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of
such person; provided, however, that, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this
Article TENTH, the Corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking
indemnification in connection with an action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof)
initiated by such person only if such action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof)
was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. The right to
indemnification conferred in this Article shall be a contract right and shall
include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in
defending any such action, suit or proceeding in advance of its final disposition;
provided. however, that, if the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by a director or officer in his
capacity as such in advance of the final disposition of any such action, suit or
proceeding shall be made only upon receipt by the Corporation of an undertaking
by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay all amounts so advanced if it
shall ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be
indemnified under this Article or otherwise. The Corporation may, by action of
the Board of Directors, provide indemnification to employees and agents of the
Corporation with the same scope and effect as the foregoing indemnification of
directors and officers.

If a claim under paragraph (a) is not paid in full by the Corporation within 30
days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may
at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid
amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be
entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a

-7-
(c)
(d)
TENTH:

defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for
expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition
where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the
Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make
it permissible under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware for
the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden
of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the
Corporation (including the Board of Directors, independent legal counscl or its
stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such
action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because
he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, nor an actual determination by the
Corporation (including the Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its
stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct,
shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not
net the applicable standard of conduct.

The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in defending a
proceeding in advance of its finial disposition conferred in this Article shall not
be exclusive of any other night which any person may have or hereafter acquire
under any statute, provision of this Certificate of Incorporation (as it may be
amended), the Bylaws of the Corporation, agreement, vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise.

The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any
director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any such expense,
liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to
indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any

provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation in the manner prescribed at the time by
statute, and all rights conferred upon stockholders in this Certificate of Incorporation are granted
subject to this reservation.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused this Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation to be duly executed as of the 3 day of May, 2006.
