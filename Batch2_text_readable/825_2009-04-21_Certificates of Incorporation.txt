circumstances resulting in such loss. The Company agrees that it would not be just and equitable if a
contribution pursuant to this Article was determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of
allocation which does not take account of the foregoing equitable considerations.

be obligated pursuant to the terms of these Articles to indemnify or advance expenses to Indemnitee with

advancement of expenses.

the numerator of which shal! be the number of shares of Outstanding Common Stock (as defined below)
