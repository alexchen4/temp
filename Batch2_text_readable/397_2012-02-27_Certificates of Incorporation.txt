1. Dividend Provisions.

(a) The holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B-2 Preferred
Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive
dividends (the “Fixed Dividends”), out of any assets legally available therefor, payable at a per
annum rate equal to eight percent (8%) (the “Dividend Rate”) of the Series A Original Issue
Price (as hereafter defined), the Series B-2 Original Issue Price (as hereafter defined), the Series
C Original Issue Price (as hereafter defined) and the Series D Original Issue Price (as hereafter
defined), respectively, calculated from the date of issuance of each such share (the “Accrual
Date”). For purposes of this Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the
“Series A Original Issue Price” and the “Series B-2 Original Issue Price” will each be $0.83 per
share, the “Series C Original Issue Price” will be $0.3791 per share, and the “Series D Original
Issue Price” will be $0.5299 per share, each as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends,

Certificate of Incorporation (the “Filing Date”). The accrued Fixed Dividends on shares of
Series D Preferred Stock shall be payable in cash when and if declared by the Board of Directors
of the Corporation (the “Board”). The accrued Fixed Dividends on shares of Series C Preferred
Stock shall be payable in cash when and if declared by the Board if and only if all accrued Fixed
Dividends have been paid to the holders of Series D Preferred Stock. The accrued Fixed
Dividends on shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock shall be payable in cash when and if declared
by the Board if and only if all accrued Fixed Dividends have been paid to the holders of Series D

Series A Preferred Stock and Series B-2 Preferred Stock shall be cancelled upon conversion of
such shares. Any dividends payable by the Corporation in excess of the Fixed Dividends
(“Additional Dividends”) shall (1) first be paid to the holders of Series D Preferred Stock until
such holders have received aggregate Additional Dividends per share of Series D Preferred Stock
that are equal to the Series D Original Issue Price, (41) then be paid to the holders of Series C
Preferred Stock until such holders have received aggregate Additional Dividends per share of
Series C Preferred Stock that are equal to the Series C Original! Issue Price, (iii) then be paid to
the holders of Series B-2 Preferred Stock until such holders have received aggregate Additional
Dividends per share of Series B-2 Preferred Stock that are equal to the Series B-2 Original Issue
Price, (iv) then to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock until such holders have received
aggregate Additional Dividends per share of Series A Preferred Stock that are equal to the Series .

147339 v12/DC
A Original Issue Price, and (v) thereafter to the holders of Common Stock, Series A Preferred
Stock, Series B-2 Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock on a
pro rata basis, based upon the number of shares of Common Stock held by each assuming the full
conversion of all shares of Preferred Stock. The Fixed Dividends will be cumulative from the
applicable Accrual Date, and will accrue on a day to day basis from the applicable Accrual Date
based, whether or not earned or declared.

(b) The Board will fix a record date for the determination of the holders of
Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend declared thereon, which record date
will not be more than forty-five (45) days prior to the date fixed for payment of such dividends.
Accrued Fixed Dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock that are not declared and paid will
compound annually at the Dividend Rate. Accrued Fixed Dividends on the Series A Preferred
Stock, Series B-2 Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock that are not declared and paid will
compound quarterly on each Dividend Compounding Date for each such series of Preferred
Stock at the Dividend Rate. For purposes of this Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, the “Dividend Compounding Date” for each share of Series A Preferred Stock,
Series B-2 Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock means the first day of each January,
April, July and October following the date of issuance of such share.

(c) Unless all accrued Fixed Dividends (whether or not declared) on each
share of Preferred Stock are paid, and the holders of each such share of Preferred Stock have
received aggregate Additional Dividends per share of Preferred Stock which are equal to the
Original Issue Price for each such share: (i) no dividends or other distributions (other than a
dividend or distribution payable solely in Common Stock) may be declared, made or paid on any
shares of Common Stock; (ii) no shares of Common Stock may be repurchased, exchanged,
redeemed or otherwise acquired for any consideration by the Corporation, any subsidiary of the
Corporation or any entity which the Corporation owns or controls (whether directly or
indirectly), provided, however, that this restriction shall not apply to the Permitted Repurchases
(as defined below); and (iii) no funds may be set apart or reserved with respect to any of the
actions described in clauses (i) or (ii).

(d) In the event the Corporation shall declare a distribution payable in
securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by the Corporation or other persons,
assets (excluding cash dividends pursuant to this Subsection B.1 of Article [V or dividends or
other distributions payable solely in Common Stock), then, in each such case the property so
distributed shall be valued for purposes of this Subsection B.1 of Article IV at its then fair
market value per share as determined by both the Corporation and the vote or written consent of
the holders of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting
as a single class on an as-converted to Common Stock basis (the “Preferred Majority”), or, if the
Corporation and the Preferred Majority cannot agree on the fair market value per share, the fair
market value per share as determined by a qualified independent appraiser selected by the
Corporation and by the vote or written consent of the Preferred Majority; or if the Corporation
and the Preferred Majority cannot agree on an appraiser, the average of the fair market value per
share as determined by a qualified independent appraiser selected by the Corporation and the fair

147339 v12/DC
market value per share as determined by a qualified independent appraiser selected by the vote or
written consent of the Preferred Majority.

(e) In the event the amount of Fixed Dividends to be paid on the Preferred
Stock at any time is not sufficient to pay the accrued but unpaid Fixed Dividends in full on such
series of Preferred Stock, any partial payment of such Fixed Dividends will be made to the
holders of such series of Preferred Stock ratably (on an as-if converted basis) in proportion to the
aggregate accrued but unpaid portion of the Fixed Dividends on the shares of the applicable
series of Preferred Stock held by such holders.

2. Liquidation Preference.

(a) In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation (a “Liquidation Event”), whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of Series D
Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive in preference to the holders of all other equity
securities of the Corporation an amount per share equal to the Series D Original Issue Price plus
all accrued but unpaid Fixed Dividends and all other declared but unpaid dividends thereon (the
“Series D Liquidation Preference”). If upon the occurrence of such event, the assets and funds
thus distributed among the holders of Series D Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit the
payment to such holders of the full Series D Liquidation Preference, then the entire assets and
funds of the Corporation legally available for distribution shall be distributed ratably among the
holders of Series D Preferred Stock, in proportion to the preferential amount each such holder
would otherwise be entitled to receive.

(b) After payment in full of the Series D Liquidation Preference, the holders
of Series C Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive in preference to the holders of the Series
B-2 Preferred Stock, the Series A Preferred Stock and the Common Stock, an amount per share
equal to the Series C Original Issue Price plus all accrued but unpaid Fixed Dividends and all
other declared but unpaid dividends thereon (the “Series C Liquidation Preference”). If upon the
occurrence of such event, the assets and funds thus distributed among the holders of Series C
Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full Series C
Liquidation Preference, then the entire assets and funds of the Corporation legally available for
distribution shall be distributed ratably among the holders of Series C Preferred Stock, in
proportion to the preferential amount each such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive.

(c) After payment in full of the Series D Liquidation Preference and the Series
C Liquidation Preference, the holders of Series B-2 Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive in
preference to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and Common Stock an amount per share
equal to the greater of (A) the Series B-2 Original Issue Price plus all accrued but unpaid Fixed
Dividends and all other declared but unpaid dividends thereon, and (B) the aggregate amount
that would be distributable with respect to the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon conversion of such share of Series B-2 Preferred Stock (assuming for purposes of
such calculation, the conversion of all other shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock and Series A
Preferred Stock) (the “Series B-2 Liquidation Preference”). If upon the occurrence of such
event, the assets and funds thus distributed among the holders of Series B-2 Preferred Stock shall

4

147339 vi2/DC
be insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full Series B-2 Liquidation
Preference, then the entire assets and funds of the Corporation legally available for distribution
shall be distributed ratably among the holders of Series B-2 Preferred Stock in proportion to the
preferential amount each such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive.

(d) After payment in full of the Series D Liquidation Preference, the Series C
Liquidation Preference and the Series B-2 Liquidation Preference, the holders of Series A
Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive in preference to the holders of Common Stock an
amount per share equal to the greater of (A) the Series A Original Issue Price plus all accrued but
unpaid Fixed Dividends and all other declared but unpaid dividends thereon, and (B) the
aggregate amount that would be distributable with respect to the aggregate number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such share of Series A Preferred Stock (assuming
for purposes of such calculation, the conversion of all other shares of Series A Preferred Stock)
(the “Series A Liquidation Preference”). If upon the occurrence of such event, the assets and
funds thus distributed among the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to
permit the payment to such holders of the full Series A Liquidation Preference, then the entire
assets and funds of the Corporation legally available for distribution shall be distributed ratably
among the holders of Series A Preferred Stock in proportion to the preferential amount each such
holder would otherwise be entitled to receive.

(e) After payment in full of the Series D Liquidation Preference, the Series C
Liquidation Preference, the Series B-2 Liquidation Preference and the Series A Liquidation
Preference, the remaining assets and funds of the Corporation legally available for distribution to
stockholders of the Corporation shall be distributed ratably to the holders of shares of Common
Stock, Series D Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock on an as-converted to Common
Stock basis.

(f) For purposes of this Article IV, a Liquidation Event shall include any of
the following transactions, unless the Preferred Majority elects otherwise by written notice sent
to the Corporation at least 10 days prior to the effective date of any such event:

(i) the acquisition of the Corporation by another entity by means of
any transaction or series of related transactions to which the Corporation is a party (including,
without limitation, any reorganization, merger or consolidation) that results in the transfer of
fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding voting power of the Corporation;

(li) any consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into any
other corporation or other entity or person, or any other corporate reorganization, other than any
such consolidation, merger or reorganization in which the shares of capital stock of the
Corporation immediately prior to such consolidation, merger or reorganization, continue to
represent a majority of the voting power of the surviving entity on an as-converted to Common
Stock basis (or, if the surviving entity is a wholly owned subsidiary, its parent) immediately after
such consolidation, merger or reorganization, (provided that, for the purpose of this Subsection
2(f)G), all shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock issuable upon exercise of options,
warrants or other rights outstanding immediately prior to such consolidation or merger shall be

5

147339 vE2/DC
deemed to be outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation and, if applicable,
converted or exchanged in such merger or consolidation on the same terms as the actual
outstanding shares of capital stock are converted or exchanged) (an “Acquisition”); provided that
an Acquisition shall not include any transaction or series of transactions principally for bona fide
equity financing purposes in which cash is received by the Corporation or any successor or
indebtedness of the Corporation is cancelled or converted or a combination thereof; or

(iii) the sale, lease, transfer, exclusive license or other disposition, in a
single transaction or series of related transactions, by the Corporation of all or substantially all of
the assets of the Corporation (including, for the avoidance of confusion, the sale or disposition,
whether by merger or otherwise, of one or more subsidiaries of the Corporation if all or
substantially all of the assets of the Corporation and its subsidiaries taken as a whole are held by
such subsidiary or subsidiaries, except where such sale or disposition is to another wholly owned
subsidiary of the Corporation).

(g) If the consideration received by the Corporation upon a Liquidation Event
is other than cash, its value will be deemed its fair market value. Any securities shall be valued
as follows:

(i) Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar
restrictions on free marketability covered by (ii) below:

(A) If traded on a securities exchange, the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange over the thirty
(30) day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing of such event;

(B) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the
thirty (30) day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing of such event; and

(C) — If there is no active public market, the value shall be the
fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Corporation and the vote or written
consent of the Preferred Majority; or, if the Corporation and the Preferred Majority cannot agree
on the fair market value, the fair market value as determined by a qualified independent appraiser
selected by the Corporation and the vote or written consent of the Preferred Majority; or if the
Corporation and the Preferred Majority cannot agree on an appraiser, the average of the fair
market value as determined by a qualified independent appraiser selected by the Corporation and
the fair market value as determined by a qualified independent appraiser selected by the vote or
written consent of the Preferred Majority.

(ii) The method of valuation of securities subject to investment letter
or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of a
stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount
trom the fair market value determined as above in (i) (A), (B) or (C) to reflect the approximate
fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Corporation and the vote or written

6

147339 v12/DC
consent of the Preferred Majority; or, if the Corporation and the Preferred Majority cannot agree
on the discount, the discount as determined by a qualified independent appraiser selected by the
Corporation and the vote or written consent of the Preferred Majority; or if the Corporation and
the Preferred Majority cannot agree on an appraiser, the average of the discount as determined by
a qualified independent appraiser selected by the Corporation and the discount as determined by
a qualified independent appraiser selected by the vote or written consent of the Preferred
Majority.

(h) In the event of a Liquidation Event referred to in Subsection 2(f)(iii) or
(iv), the Corporation will effect a dissolution of the Corporation under the Delaware General
Corporation Law, and cause the distribution of the available proceeds from such Liquidation
Event to occur in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Section 2, within 90 days
after such Liquidation Event.

3. Redemption.

(a) At any time and from time to time after the fifth anniversary of the Filing
Date, the Preferred Majority may require that the Corporation purchase the shares of Preferred
Stock held by such holders, on a date selected by the Preferred Majority (each a “Redemption
Date’) that is at least six (6) months after written notice is given to the Corporation, and the
Corporation shall purchase such shares, for a price per share (the “Redemption Price”) equal to
the greater of: (A) the sum of (i) the Series D Original Issue Price, the Series C Original Issue
Price, the Series B-2 Original Issue Price or the Series A Original Issue Price (each an “Original
Issue Price”), as applicable, plus (ii) all accrued but unpaid dividends, including Fixed
Dividends, with respect to such share, (B) an amount which, after taking into account the receipt
of all prior dividends, including Fixed Dividends, provides a holder of such share with an
amount equal to 150% of the applicable Original Issue Price, or (C) the fair market value of such
share as of the date of such notice as mutually determined by the Corporation and the vote or
written consent of the Preferred Majority, or, if the Corporation and the Preferred Majority
cannot agree on the fair market value, the fair market value as determined by a qualified
independent appraiser selected by the Corporation and by the vote or written consent of the
Preferred Majority; or, if the Corporation and the Preferred Majority cannot agree on an
appraiser, the average of the fair market value as determined by a qualified independent
appraiser selected by the Corporation and the fair market value as determined by a qualified
independent appraiser selected by the vote or written consent of the Preferred Majority. Such
shares of Preferred Stock shall be redeemed in three (3) annual installments, and the number of
shares of Preferred Stock that the Corporation shall be required to redeem on any one
Redemption Date shal! be equal to the amount determined by dividing (x) the aggregate number
of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Redemption Date by (y) the
number of remaining Redemption Dates (including the Redemption Date to which such
calculation applies). Shares subject to redemption pursuant to this Subsection B.3(a) shall be
redeemed from each holder of Preferred Stock on a pro rata basis, based on the number of shares
of Preferred Stock then held.

147339 v12/DC
(b) At least fifteen (15) but no more than thirty (30) days prior to each
Redemption Date, written notice (the “Redemption Notice”) shall be mailed, first class postage
prepaid, to each holder of record (at the close of business on the business day next preceding the
day on which notice is given) of the Preferred Stock to be redeemed, at the address last shown on
the records of the Corporation for such holder, notifying such holder of the redemption to be
effected on the applicable Redemption Date, specifying the number of shares to be redeemed
from such holder, the Redemption Date, the applicable Redemption Price, the place at which
payment may be obtained and calling upon such holder to surrender to the Corporation, in the
manner and at the place designated, the holder’s certificate or certificates representing the shares
to be redeemed (the “Redemption Shares”). Except as provided in Subsection B.3(c), on or after
each Redemption Date, each holder of the Redemption Shares to be redeemed on such
Redemption Date shall surrender to the Corporation the certificate or certificates representing
such shares, in the manner and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice, and thereupon
the applicable Redemption Price of such shares shall be payable to the order of the person whose
name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof and each surrendered
certificate shall be canceled. In the event less than all the shares represented by any such
certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares.

(c) From and after the applicable Redemption Date, unless there shall have
been a default in payment of any applicable Redemption Price, all rights of the holders of
Redemption Shares designated for redemption on such Redemption Date in the Redemption
Notice as holders of such Preferred Stock (except the right to receive the applicable Redemption
Price without interest upon surrender of their certificate or certificates), shall cease with respect to
such shares, and such shares shall not thereafter be transferred on the books of the Corporation or
be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose whatsoever. If the funds of the Corporation legally
available for the redemption of the Redemption Shares on a Redemption Date are insufficient to
redeem the total number of shares to be redeemed on such date, those funds that are legally
available will be used to redeem the maximum possible number of such shares of each series of
Preferred Stock in the following order of preference: first, the Series D Preferred Stock; second,
the Series C Preferred Stock; and third, the Series B-2 Preferred Stock and the Series A Preferred
Stock, on a pari passu basis. If upon the occurrence of such redemption, the assets and funds of
the Corporation are insufficient to permit the redemption of all of the shares of Series D Preferred
Stock (subject to Subsection B.3(d) below), the entire assets and funds of the Corporation legally
available for use in such redemption shall be distributed ratably among the holders of Series D
Preferred Stock in proportion to the amount each such holder would otherwise be entitled to
receive. If upon the occurrence of such redemption, the assets and funds of the Corporation are
insufficient to permit the redemption of all of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock (subject to
Subsection B.3(d) below) and all of the shares of Series D Preferred Stock (subject to Subsection
B.3(d) below) have been redeemed, the entire assets and funds -of the Corporation legally
available for use in such redemption shall be distributed ratably among the holders of Series C
Preferred Stock in proportion to the amount each such holder would otherwise be entitled to
receive. If upon the occurrence of such redemption, the assets and funds of the Corporation are
insufficient to permit the redemption of all of the shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock and Series
A Preferred Stock (subject to Subsection B.3(d) below) and all of the shares of Series D Preferred
Stock and Series C Preferred Stock (subject to Subsection B.3(d) below) have been redeemed, the

8

147339 v12/DC
entire assets and funds of the Corporation legally available for use in such redemption shall be
distributed ratably among the holders of Series B-2 Preferred Stock and Series A Preferred Stock
in proportion to the amount each such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive, on a pari
passu basis.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, any holder of
shares of Preferred Stock may elect to exclude all or any portion of the shares of Preferred Stock
held by such holder from being redeemed by the Corporation by providing written notice to the
Corporation mailed, first class postage, at least ten (10) days prior to the applicable Redemption
Date.

(e) All shares of Preferred Stock not redeemed shall remain outstanding and
entitled to all the rights and preferences provided herein and the Fixed Dividends as provided for
in Subsection B.1 shall continue to accrue with respect to such shares. Subject to Subsection
B.3(d) above, at any time thereafter when additional funds of the Corporation are legally available
for the redemption of of such shares of Preferred Stock, such funds will immediately be used to
redeem, first, the balance of the shares of Series D Preferred Stock that the Corporation has
become obliged to redeem but that it has not redeemed, second, the balance of the shares of Series
C Preferred Stock that the Corporation has become obliged to redeem but that it has not redeemed
and then third, the balance of the shares of Series B-2 and Series A Preferred Stock that the
Corporation has become obliged to redeem but that it has not redeemed, on a pari passu basis.

4. Conversion. The holders of Preferred Stock shall have conversion obligations
and rights as follows:

(a) Optional Conversion.

(i) Each share of Preferred Stock may at any time be converted as set
forth below into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is
determined by dividing the applicable Original Issue Price by the Conversion Price applicable to
such series of Preferred Stock, determined as hereafter provided in Subsection B.4(b), in effect
on the date the certificate is surrendered for conversion.

(ii) All of the unpaid Fixed Dividends on each share of Series D

Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock converted into shares of Common Stock pursuant
to Subsection B.4(a)(i) that are accrued and unpaid as of the Conversion Time (as defined below)
(the “Optional Conversion Accrued Dividends”) shall either be (A) paid in cash at or before the
Conversion Time or (B) converted into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Optional Conversion Accrued Dividends by the
higher of (x) the fair market value per share of the Common Stock as of the Conversion Time or
' (y) the applicable Conversion Price as of the Conversion Time; provided, however that the
Corporation shall, in its sole and absolute discretion, elect whether the Optional Conversion
Accrued Dividends are paid in cash or converted into Common Stock pursuant to this Subsection
B.4(a)(@i). In the event the Corporation elects to convert the Optional Conversion Accrued
Dividends into Common Stock pursuant to this Subsection B.4(a)(ii) then the fair market value

9

147339 v12/DC
per share of the Common Stock shall be determined by both the Corporation and the vote or
written consent of the holders of a majority of the Series D Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred
Stock and Special Voting Stock, voting together on an as-converted to Common Stock basis (the
“Senior Preferred Majority”), or, if the Corporation and the Senior Preferred Majority cannot

Majority cannot agree on an appraiser, the average of the fair market value per share as
determined by a qualified independent appraiser selected by the Corporation and the fair market
value per share as determined by a qualified independent appraiser selected by the vote or
written consent of the Senior Preferred Majority (the “Common Stock Valuation Procedure’).

(b) Conversion Price.

the right to convert shares of Preferred Stock as set forth in Subsection B.4(a)(i), and ail rights
with respect to the Optional Conversion Accrued Dividends as set forth in Subsection B.4(a)(ii),
shall terminate at the close of business on the last full day preceding the date fixed for the
payment of any such amounts distributable on such event to the holders of Preferred Stock;
provided, however, nothing herein shall be deemed to affect the rights of the holders of Preferred
Stock to the amounts they are entitled to with respect to a Liquidation Event (including amounts
calculated with reference to accrued and unpaid dividends).

(d) Mechanics of Conversion.

(i) Notice of Conversion. In order for a holder of Preferred Stock to
voluntarily convert shares of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall
surrender the certificate or certificates for such shares of Preferred Stock (or, if such registered
holder alleges that such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit
and agreement reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against
any claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or
destruction of such certificate), at the office of the transfer agent for Preferred Stock (or at the
principal office of the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent), together
with written notice that such holder elects to convert all or any number of the shares of Preferred
Stock represented by such certificate or certificates and, if applicable, any event on which such
conversion is contingent. Such notice shall state such holder’s name or the names of the
nominees in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock
to be issued. If required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be
endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory
to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or his, her or its attorney duly
authorized in writing. The close of business on the date of receipt by the transfer agent (or by the
Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent) of such certificates (or lost
certificate affidavit and agreement) and notice shall be the time of conversion (the “Conversion
Time”), and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the shares represented by
such certificate and, as applicable, the Optional Conversion Accrued Dividends, shail be deemed
to be outstanding of record as of such date. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after
the Conversion Time, (i) issue and deliver to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to his, her or its
nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable
upon such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof and a certificate for the number
(if any) of the shares of Preferred Stock represented by the surrendered certificate that were not
converted into Common Stock, (ii) pay in cash such amount as provided in Subsection B.4q)(i)
in lieu of any fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion, (iii)
pay all declared but unpaid dividends on the shares of Preferred Stock converted and (iv) as
applicable, pay in cash the Optional Conversion Accrued Dividends.

(ii) Effect_of Conversion. All shares of Preferred Stock which shall
have been surrendered for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be
outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares shall immediately cease and terminate at

1]

147339 vk2/DC
the Conversion Time, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive shares of Common
Stock in exchange therefor (including, as applicable, with respect to the Optional Conversion
Accrued Dividends), to receive payment in lieu of any fraction of a share otherwise issuable
upon such conversion as provided in Subsection B.4(j)(i), to receive payment of any dividends
declared but unpaid thereon and, as applicable, to receive payment of any Optional Conversion
Accrued Dividends. Any shares of Preferred Stock so converted shall be retired and cancelled
and may not be reissued as shares of such series, and the Corporation may thereafter take such
appropriate action (without the need for stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the
authorized number of shares of Preferred Stock accordingly.

(iii) | No Further Adjustment. Upon any such conversion, no adjustment
to the Conversion Price of the applicable series of Preferred Stock shall be made for any declared
but unpaid dividends on the Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion or on the Common Stock
delivered upon conversion.

(iv) Taxes. The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and other
similar taxes that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of Common
Stock upon conversion of shares of Preferred Stock and, as applicable, the Optional Conversion
Accrued Dividends), pursuant to this Subsection B.4(d). The Corporation shal! not, however, be
required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance
and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in which the shares of
Preferred Stock so converted were registered, and no such issuance or delivery shall be made
unless and until the person or entity requesting such issuance has paid to the Corporation the
amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax
has been paid.

(e) Automatic Conversion.

(i) The conversion of all shares of Preferred Stock, at the then
applicable conversion rate specified in Subsection B.4(a)(i), shall automatically occur (i)
immediately prior to the Corporation’s sale of its Common Stock in a firm-commitment
underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement on Form S-1 or a
comparable successor form then in effect under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the
public offerimg price of which is not less than four (4) times the Series D Original Issue Price per
share (adjusted to reflect subsequent stock dividends, stock splits or recapitalizations occurring
after the Filing Date) and proceeds to the Corporation which are not less than $40,000,000 in the
aggregate (net of underwriters’ discounts and expenses) (a “Qualifying IPO”) or (ii) on the date
and time, or the occurrence of an event, specified by a vote or written consent of the Preferred
Majority (a “Preferred Majority Automatic Conversion”) upon which the Corporation obtains the
consent or affirmative vote to such automatic conversion from the Preferred Majority (the time
of such conversion pursuant to either clause (i) or (ii) is referred to herein as the “Automatic
Conversion Time”).

(ii) All of the unpaid Fixed Dividends on each share of Series D

Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock converted into shares of Common Stock pursuant to
12

147339 v12/DC
Subsection B.4(e)(i) that are accrued and unpaid as of the Automatic Conversion Time (the
“Automatic Conversion Accrued Dividends”, and together with the Optional Conversion
Accrued Dividends, the “Conversion Accrued Dividends”) shall, in the event of a Qualifying
IPO, automatically be paid in cash by the Corporation at the Automatic Conversion Time. In the
event of a Preferred Majority Automatic Conversion, the Automatic Conversion Accrued
Dividends shall either be (A) paid in cash at or before the Automatic Conversion Time or (B)
converted into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is
determined by dividing the Automatic Conversion Accrued Dividends by the higher of (X) the
fair market value per share of the Common Stock as of the Automatic Conversion Time or (Y)
the applicable Conversion Price as of the Automatic Conversion Time; provided, however that
the Corporation shall, in its sole and absolute discretion, elect whether the Automatic Conversion
Accrued Dividends are paid in cash or converted into Common Stock in connection with a
Preferred Majority Automatic Conversion pursuant to this Subsection B.4(e)(ii). In the event the
Corporation elects to convert the Automatic Conversion Accrued Dividends into Common Stock
pursuant to this Subsection B.4(e)(ii) then the fair market value per share of the Common Stock
shall be determined by the Common Stock Valuation Procedure.

(iii) All holders of record of shares of Preferred Stock shal! be sent
written notice of the Automatic Conversion Time and the place designated for mandatory
conversion of all such shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Subsection B.4(e)(iii). Such
notice need not be sent in advance of the occurrence of the Automatic Conversion Time. Upon
receipt of such notice, each holder of shares of Preferred Stock shall surrender his, her or its
certificate or certificates for all such shares (or, if such holder alleges that such certificate has
been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to
the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made against the
Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate) to the
Corporation at the place designated in such notice. If so required by the Corporation, certificates
surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by written instrument or
instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered
holder or by his, her or its attorney duly authorized in writing. All rights with respect to the
Preferred Stock and, as applicable, Automatic Conversion Accrued Dividends, converted
pursuant to Subsections B.4(e)(i) and (ii), respectively, including the rights, if any, to receive
notices and vote (other than as a holder of Common Stock), will terminate at the Automatic
Conversion Time (notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender the
certificates at or prior to such time), except only the rights of the holders thereof, upon surrender
of their certificate or certificates (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement) therefor, to receive
the items provided for in the next sentence of this Subsection B.4(e)(iii). As soon as practicable
after the Automatic Conversion Time and the surrender of the certificate or certificates (or lost
certificate affidavit and agreement) for Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall issue and deliver to
such holder, or to his, her or its nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of full
shares of Common Stock issuable on such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof
including, as applicable, shares issuable in payment of any Automatic Conversion Accrued
Dividends together with cash as provided in Subsection B.4(j)(i) in lieu of any fraction of a share
of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion and the payment of any declared but

13

147339 v12/DC
unpaid dividends on the shares of Preferred Stock converted and, as applicable, cash for payment
of any Automatic Conversion Accrued Dividends. Such converted shares of Preferred Stock
shall be retired and cancelled and may not be reissued as shares of such series, and the
Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate action (without the need for stockholder action)
as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Preferred Stock accordingly.

(f) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at
all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock,
solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of Preferred Stock, such number
of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (other than for dividends accrued on the Preferred Stock)
and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be
sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, in addition to
such other remedies as shall be available to the holders of Preferred Stock, the Corporation will
take such corporate action as may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of
Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including,
without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any
necessary amendment to this Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

(g} Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock for Splits and
Combinations. If at any time or from time to time on or after the date that the Filing Date the

Corporation effects a subdivision of the outstanding Common Stock, the applicable Conversion
Price in effect immediately before that subdivision shall be proportionately decreased.
Conversely, if at any time or from time to time after the Filing Date the Corporation combines
the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, the applicable
Conversion Price in effect immediately before the combination shall be proportionately
increased. Any adjustment under this Subsection B.4(g) shall become effective at the close of
business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective.

(h) Sale of Shares Below Applicable Conversion Price.

(i) If the Corporation shall issue, at any time after the Filing Date, any
Additional Shares of Common Stock (as defined below) without consideration for an Effective
Price (as defined below) that is less than the Conversion Price then in effect with respect to any
series of Preferred Stock, then, in each such case, such Conversion Price shall be reduced, as of
the opening of business on the date of such issue, to a price determined by multiplying such
Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Stock deemed outstanding (as defined below) immediately prior to such issuance plus
the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received by the
Corporation for such issuance would purchase at such Conversion Price; and the denominator of
which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock deemed outstanding immediately prior to
such issuance plus the number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued. For the
purposes of the preceding sentence, the number of shares of “Common Stock deemed
outstanding” as of a given date shall be the sum of (A) the number of shares of Common Stock
actually outstanding, (B) the number of shares of Common Stock into which the then outstanding

14

147339 v12/DC
shares of Preferred Stock could be converted if fully converted into Common Stock under this
Subsection B.4 on the day immediately preceding the given date, and (C) the number of shares of
Common Stock which could be obtained through the exercise or conversion of all other rights,
options and convertible securities outstanding or exercisable on the day immediately preceding
the given date.

(ii) No Adjustment of Conversion Price. No adjustment in the
Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock shall be made as the result of the issuance or
deemed issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock if the Corporation receives the prior
written consent of the Preferred Majority agreeing that no such adjustment shall be made as the
result of the issuance or deemed issuance of such Additional Shares of Common Stock.

(iii) Except to the limited extent provided for in Subsections
B.4(h)(vi)(C) or (D), no adjustment of the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock
pursuant to this Subsection B.4(h) shall have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price above
the Conversion Price for such series in effect immediately prior to such adjustment.

(iv) In the case of the issuance of Common Stock for cash, the
consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefore before deducting any
reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the
Corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

(v) In the case of the issuance of the Common Stock for consideration
in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be deemed to be the
fair value thereof as determined by the Board irrespective of any accounting treatment.

(vi) In the case of the issuance of options to purchase or nghts to
subscribe for Common Stock, securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for
Common Stock or options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or
exchangeable securities, the following provisions shall apply for all purposes of this Subsection
B.4(h):

(A) The aggregate maximum number of shares of Common
Stock deliverable upon exercise (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to exercisability,
including without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account potential anti-
dilution adjustments) of such options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common Stock shall
be deemed to have been issued at the time such options or rights were issued and for
consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in Subsections
B.4(h)(iv) and (v), if any, received by the Corporation upon the issuance of such options or rights
plus the minimum exercise price provided in such options or rights (without taking into account
potential anti-dilution adjustments) for the Common Stock covered thereby.

(B) The aggregate maximum number of shares of Common

Stock deliverable upon conversion of, or in exchange for (assuming the satisfaction of any

conditions to convertibility or exchangeability, including, without limitation, the passage of time,
15

147339 vi2/DC
but without taking into account potential anti-dilution adjustments), any such convertible or
exchangeable securities or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for
such convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof shall
be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or such options or rights
were issued and for consideration equal to the consideration, if any, received by the Corporation
for any such securities and related options or rights (excluding any cash received on account of
accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the minimum additional consideration, if any, to be
received by the Corporation (without taking into account potential anti-dilution adjustments)
upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or the exercise of any related options or
rights (the consideration in each case to be determined in the manner provided in Subsections
B.4(h\(iv) and (v).

(C) In the event of any change in the number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon exercise of
such options or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such convertible or exchangeable
securities, including, but not limited to, a change resulting from the anti-dilution provisions
thereof (unless such options or rights or convertible or exchangeable securities were merely
deemed to be included in the numerator and denominator for purposes of determining the
number of shares of Common Stock deeemed outstanding, the applicable Conversion Price, to
the extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, rights or securities, shall be
recomputed to reflect such change, but no further adjustment shall be made for the actual
issuance of Common Stock or any payment of such consideration upon the exercise of any such
options or rights or the conversion or exchange of such securities.

(D) Upon the expiration of any such options or rights, the
termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options or rights
related to such convertible or exchangeable securities (unless such options or rights or
convertible or exchangeable securities were merely deemed to be included in the numerator and
denominator for purposes of determining the number of shares of Common Stock deemed
outstanding, the applicable Conversion Price, to the extent in any way affected by such options,
rights or securities or options or rights related to such securities, shall be readjusted as if such
options, rights or securities or options or rights related to such securities had not been issued.

(vii) In the event the Corporation shall issue on more than one date
Additional Shares of Common Stock that are a part of one transaction or a series of related
transactions and that would result in an adjustment to a Conversion Price pursuant to the terms of
Subsection B.4(h) then, upon the final such issuance, such Conversion Price shall be readjusted
to give effect to all such issuances as if they occurred on the date of the first such issuance (and
without giving effect to any additional adjustments as a result of any such subsequent issuances
within such period).

(viii) “Additional Shares of Common Stock” shall mean any shares of
Common Stock issued or deemed to have been issued pursuant to Subsection B.4(h) by the
Corporation after the Filing Date other than the following (collectively the “Exempted
Securities”):

16

147339 v12/DC
(A) | Shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to a transaction
described in Subsection B.4(i) hereof;

(B) Shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of the
Preferred Stock (or the conversion of dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock or Series C
Preferred Stock);

(C) Shares of Common Stock issued upon the exercise or
conversion of other stock, options, warrants convertible stock or securities outstanding as of the
Filing Date;

(D) Shares of Common Stock issuable or issued to employees,
consultants, directors or vendors (if in transactions with primarily compensatory, non-financing
purposes) of the Corporation pursuant to any stock option plans or restricted stock plan approved
by the Board or assumed pursuant to an acquisition;

(E) Shares of Common Stock or options or warrants
exercisable for Common Stock issued with the approval of the Board to banks, savings and loan
associations, equipment lessors or other similar lending institutions in connection with such
entities providing credit facilities or financing to the Corporation;

(F) Shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock issued upon
conversion of securities or exercise of warrants issued pursuant to that certain Note and Warrant
Purchase Agreement dated November 8, 2011, by and among the Corporation and the purchasers
listed on the Schedule of Purchasers thereto, as may be amended from time to time; or

(G) Shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to a Qualifying
IPO.

(i) Recapitalizations. If at any time or from time to time there shall be a
recapitalization of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision, combination, reorganization or
merger or sale of assets transaction provided for elsewhere in Subsections B.2 or B.4), provision
shall be made so that the holders of Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon
conversion of such series of Preferred Stock, in lieu of each share of Common Stock otherwise
issuable upon such conversion, the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of
the Corporation or otherwise, to which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock
deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled upon such recapitalization. In any such
case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Subsection
B.4 with respect to the rights of the holders of Preferred Stock after the recapitalization to the
end that the provisions of Subsection B.4 (including adjustment of the Conversion Price then in
effect and the number of shares purchasable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be
applicable after that event as nearly equivalent as may be practicable.

G) No Fractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments.

17

147339 v12/DC
(i) No fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of the
Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would otherwise be entitled,
the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair market value of a
share of Common Stock as determined in good faith by the Board of the Corporation. Whether
or not fractional shares would be issuable upon such conversion shal] be determined on the basis
of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock the holder is at the time converting into
Common Stock and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such aggregate
conversion.

(ii) | Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the
Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock, pursuant to this Subsection B.4, the Corporation, at its
expense, shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms
hereof and prepare and furnish to each holder of Preferred Stock, a certificate setting forth such
adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or
readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder
of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth
(A) such adjustment and readjustment, (B) the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred
Stock at the time in effect, and (C) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if
any, of other property that at the time would be received upon the conversion of such series of
Preferred Stock.

(k) Notices of Record Date. In the event:

(A) the Corporation shall take a record of the holders of its
Common Stock (or other capital stock or securities at the time issuable upon conversion of the
Preferred Stock) for the purpose of entitling or enabling them to receive any dividend or other
distribution, or to receive any right to subscribe for or purchase any shares of capital stock of any
class or any other securities, or to receive any other security; or

(B) of any capital reorganization of the Corporation or any
reclassification of the Common Stock of the Corporation; or

(C) — of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or
winding-up of the Corporation,

Preferred Stock a notice specifying, as the case may be, (i) the record date for such dividend,
distribution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right, or (ii)
the effective date on which such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer,
dissolution, liquidation or winding-up.is proposed to take place, and the time, if any is to be
fixed, as of which the holders of record of Common Stock (or such other capital stock or
securities at the time issuable upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be entitled to
exchange their shares of Common Stock (or such other capital stock or securities) for securities
or other property deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger,
transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, and the amount per share and character of such

18

147339 v12/DC
exchange applicable to the Preferred Stock and the Common Stock. Such notice shall be sent at
least 10 days prior to the record date or effective date for the event specified in such notice.

(1) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Subsection B.4 to
be given to the holders of Preferred Stock shall be deemed given if deposited in the United States
mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to each holder of record at his address appearing on the
books of the Corporation.

5. Voting Rights.

(a) General Rights. On any matter presented to the stockholders of the
Corporation for their action or consideration at any meeting of stockholders of the Corporation
{or by written consent of stockholders in lieu of meeting) each holder of shares of Preferred
Stock shall have the right to one vote for each share of Common Stock into which such Preferred
Stock could then be converted as of the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote
on such matter. With respect to such vote, such holder shall have full voting rights and powers
equal to the voting rights and powers of the holders of Common Stock, and shall be entitled,
notwithstanding any provision hereof, to notice of any stockholders’ meeting in accordance with
the Bylaws of the Corporation, and shall be entitled to vote, together with holders of Common

(b) Election of Directors.
(i) The Board shall consist of seven (7) directors.

applicable, fail to elect a sufficient number of directors to fill all directorships for which they are
entitled to elect directors, voting exclusively and as a separate class, pursuant to Subsection
B.5(b), then any directorship not so filled shall remain vacant until such time as the holders of
the Preferred Stock or Common Stock, as applicable, elect a person to fill such directorship by
vote or written consent in lieu of a meeting; and no such directorship may be filled by
stockholders of the Corporation other than by the stockholders of the Corporation that are
