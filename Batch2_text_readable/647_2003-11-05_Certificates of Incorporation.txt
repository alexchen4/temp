Series D-1 Preferred, Series E Preferred and Series E-1 Preferred, together with any declared and

Common Stock at the respective Conversion Prices at the time in effect for such series of
Preferred Stock immediately upon the earlier of (i) the sale of the Corporation’s Common Stock
in a firm commitment underwritten public offermg pursuant to an effective registration statement
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act” ), the public offering price of which is
not less than $2.898 per share (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations
or the like after the filing of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation) and with
gross proceeds to the Corporation of not less than $30,000,000 in the aggregate or (ii) the date
upon which the Corporation obtains the vote or written consent of at least a majority of the then
outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, voting together as a class, to such conversion, _

3. Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to convert the same into full shares of Common Stock and to receive certificates therefor,
he shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the
Corporation or of any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the
Corporation at such office that such holder elects to convert the same; provided, however, that in
the event of an automatic conversion pursuant to Section D.2 above, the outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically without any farther action by the holders of
such shares and whether or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the
Corporation or its transfer agent, and provided further that the Corporation shall not be obligated
to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such automatic
conversion unless the certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are either delivered
to the Corporation or its transfer agent as provided above, or the holder notifies the Corporation
or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an
agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred
by it in connection with such certificates. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after
such delivery, or such agreement and indemnification in the case of a lost certificate, issue and
deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, a certificate or certificates for the

MPI93S6S2.7 6
number of shares of Common Stock to which the holder shall be entitled and a check payable to
the holder in the amount of any cash amounts payable as the result of a conversion into fractional
shares of Common Stock. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately
prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be
converted, or in the case of automatic conversion, on the date of closing of the underwritten
offering or at the close of business on the date of a vote or written consent to conversion,
whichever may be applicable, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record
holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date.

4. Fractional Shares. In lieu of any fractional shares of Common Stock to
which the holder of Preferred Stock would otherwise be entitled upon conversion pursuant to
this Article IV_D., the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair
market value of one share of Common Stock as determined by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation. Whether or not fractional shares are issuable upon such conversion shall be
determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock of each holder at the

time converting into Common Stock and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
such ageregate conversion.

5. Special Series E-I Preferred Conversion Right. tn addition to the
Conversion Rights set forth in Article TV_D.1 and D.2 above, each share of Series E-1 Preferred
shali be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, into fully paid and nonassessable shares
(in the manner and amount set forth below) of that series of Preferred Stock issued by the
Corporation in a Qualified Financing (as defined below) at the time of such Qualified Financing.
A “Qualified Financing” means the next sale of Preferred Stock (the “Next Preferred”) by the
Corporation in a transaction the primary purpose of which is the raising of capital that: (i) occurs
after the date shares of Series E-1 Preferred were first sold and issued by the Company and prior
to December 31, 2004; and (ii) includes an investor that is not prior to such sale a holder of
shares of the Corporation’s securities. The number of shares of Next Preferred into which each
share of Series E-I Preferred shall be convertible pursuant to this Section D.5 shall be as
determined by dividing the Issuance Price of the Series E-1 Preferred by the per share price at
which the Next Preferred is sold in the Qualified Financing.

E. Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock for Certain Dilutive Issuances.
The respective Conversion Prices of the Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time
to time as follows:

1. If the Corporation shall issue, at any time or from time to time after the
date upon which any shares of Preferred Stock were first issued and sold, or deemed issued and
sold by the express provisions of this subsection 1 (the “Purchase Date” with respect to such

the Corporation’s outstanding capital stock as provided in subsection (F)(a) of this Article IV,
and other than a subdivision or combination of the Corporation’s outstanding capital stock as
provided in subsection (F)(b) of this Article IV, then in each such case the Conversion Price for
each of the Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred, Series B-1 Preferred, Series C Preferred,
Series C-1 Preferred, Series D Preferred and Series D-1 Preferred in effect immediately prior to
each such issuance shall forthwith be adjusted to a new Conversion Price equal to the quotient of

MP1.935682.7 7
(A) an amount equal to (i) the total number of shares of Common Stock
Outstanding (as hereinafter defined) at the close of business on the Purchase Date of such Series
multiplied by the Issuance Price of such series immediately in effect prior to such issuance of
Additional Stock, plus (ii) the ageregate amount of all consideration, if any, received by the
Corporation for the issuance or sale of Additional Stock following the Purchase Date of such
Series; divided by

Preferred, Series C-1 Preferred, Series D-1 Preferred and Series E-1 Preferred shall be deemed to
be the date upon which any shares of Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred, Series C Preferred,
Series D Preferred and Series E Preferred, respectively, were first issued and sold and; provided
further, that the Conversion Price of the Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred, Series B-i
Preferred, Series C Preferred, Series C-1 Preferred, Series D Preferred and Series D-] Preferred

for stock splits, combinations and similar acts. If the Corporation shall] issue, after the Purchase
Date of the Series E Preferred, any Additional Stock without consideration or for a consideration
per share less than the Conversion Price for the Series E Preferred in effect immediately prior to

immediately prior to each such issuance shall be forthwith adjusted to the price paid, or deemed
to be paid, per share for such Additional Stock. If the Corporation shall issue, after the Purchase
Date of the Series E-1 Preferred, any Additional Stock without consideration or for a
consideration per share less than the Conversion Price for the Series E-1 Preferred in effect
immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock, the Conversion Price for the

Series E-] Preferred in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall be forthwith adjusted
to the price paid, or deemed to be paid, per share for such Additional Stock. For the purposes of
this Section E.1, “Common Stock Outstanding” shall mean all outstanding shares of Common
Stock and all shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock or other
convertible instruments or upon exercise of options or warrants or other rights to acquire
Common Stock that are outstanding as of the close of business on any applicable date; provided,
however, that Option Shares (as defined below) excluded from the definition of Additional Stock
in subsection E.2 shall be excluded from the definition of Common Stock Outstanding.

(a) No adjustment of the Conversion Price for the applicable Preferred
Stock shall be made in an amount less than one cent per share, provided that any adjustments
which are not required to be made by reason of this sentence shall be carried forward and shall
be either taken into account in any subsequent adjustment made prior to three years from the date
of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward, or shall be made at the end of
three years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward. Except
to the limited extent provided for in subsections (dill) and (d)@v) below, no adjustment of such

such adjustment.
