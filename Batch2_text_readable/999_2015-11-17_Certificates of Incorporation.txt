directors (the “Board of Directors”), prior and in preference to the Common Stock. No dividends
other than those payable solely in Common Stock shall be paid on any Common Stock unless and
until (i) the aforementioned dividend is paid on each outstanding share of Preferred Stock, and (ii) a
dividend is paid with respect to all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock in an amount equal to or
greater than the aggregate amount of dividends which would be payable on each share of Preferred
Stock if} immediately prior to such dividend payment on Common Stock, it had been converted into

shall be noncumulative. The Company shall make no Distribution (as defined below) to the holders

earnings and/or assets that would otherwise be applicable to Distributions made by the Company in
connection with the repurchase of shares of Common Stock issued to or held by employees,
consultants, advisors, officers, directors or other service providers of the Company or any of the
Company’s subsidiaries at a price not greater than the amount paid by such person for such shares
upon termination of their employment or services pursuant to agreements providing for the right of

Benvenue Medical - Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (Series F)_(palib2_7678050_4)
distribution shall be distributed with equal priority and pro rata among the holders of the Series F

Preferred and Series E Preferred then held by them before any payment shall be made or any assets
distributed to the holders of Series A-1 Preferred, Series B-1 Preferred or Common Stock. If upon

Liquidation Preference for their shares, then the entire remaining assets of the Company legally
available for distribution shall be distributed with equal priority and pro rata among the holders of
the Series C Preferred, the Series D Preferred and the Series E Preferred based on the relative
amount to which they would otherwise be entitled.

of the full Liquidation Preference for their shares, then the entire remaining assets of the Company
legally available for distribution shall be distributed with equal priority among the holders of the
Series A-1 Preferred and Series B-1 Preferred pro rata based on the relative amount to which they

(v) | Any amendment of this Section 2(a) to eliminate in
their entirety the Liquidation Preferences of all Preferred Stock, which amendment occurs in
connection with a Liquidation, shall not be effective as to the Series F Preferred Stock unless
approved by holders of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the Series F Preferred Stock then outstanding.

(b) Remaining Assets. After the payment to the holders of
Preferred Stock of the full preferential amounts specified above, any remaining assets of the

A-3

Benvenue Medical - Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (Series F)_(palib2_7678050_4)
Company shall be distributed with equal priority and pro rata among the holders of the Company’s
Common Stock and Series C Preferred, treating in such circumstances the Series C Preferred as if it
had been converted into Common Stock at the then applicable conversion rate, until such time as
each share of Series C Preferred has received an aggregate distribution equal to the Participation
Cap, at which point no further payments shall be made to the holders of Series C Preferred by reason
thereof and any remaining assets of the Company shall be distributed with equal priority and pro rata
among the holders of the Company’s Common Stock. “Participation Cap” shall mean aggregate
distributions equal to two hundred percent (200%) of the Liquidation Preference for such share of
Series C Preferred (including the distributions made pursuant to Section 2(a)(i) above and this
Section 2(b)), plus any declared or accumulated but unpaid dividends.

(c) Liquidation. A “Liquidation” shall be deemed to be
occasioned by, or to include, (i) the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company; (ii) any
merger, acquisition, consolidation, or other corporate reorganization of the Company by means of
any transaction or series of related transactions in which the Company’s stockholders constituted
immediately prior to such transaction hold less than fifty percent (50%) of the voting power of the
surviving or acquiring entity, or in which excess of fifty percent (50%) of the Company’s voting
power is transferred, excluding any consolidation or merger effective exclusively to change the
domicile of the Company; or (iii) a sale, lease, or other disposition of all or substantially all of the
assets of the Company, or a grant of a worldwide exclusive license under all or substantially all
material intellectual property of the Company. In the event of a deemed “Liquidation” pursuant to
clause (iii) in this Section 2(c) above, if the Company does not effect a dissolution of the Company
under the Delaware General Corporation Law within forty-five (45) days after such deemed
Liquidation, then (A) the Company shail deliver a written notice to each holder of Preferred Stock
no later than the forty-fifth (45th) day after the deemed Liquidation advising such holders of their
right (and the requirements to be met to secure such right) pursuant to the terms of the following
clause (B) to require the redemption of such shares of Preferred Stock, and (B) if the holders of a
majority of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock so request in a written instrument
delivered to the Company not later than sixty (60) days after such deemed Liquidation, the Company
shall use the consideration received by the Company for such deemed Liquidation (net of any
liabilities associated with the assets sold or technology licensed, as determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors of the Company), to the extent legally available therefor (the “Net Proceeds”), to
redeem, on the seventy-fifth (75th) day after such deemed Liquidation (the “Liquidation
Redemption Date”), all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock in such priority and at the prices per
share equal to the applicable Liquidation Preference and Participation Cap specified in Sections 2(a)
and 2(b) above. In the event of a redemption pursuant to the preceding sentence, if the Net Proceeds
are not sufficient to redeem all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, the Company shall redeem
shares of Preferred Stock in the order of priority and in such amounts as specified in Sections 2(a)
and 2(b) above. Prior to the distribution or redemption provided for in this Section 2(c), the
Company shall not expend or dissipate the consideration received for such deemed Liquidation,
except to discharge expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business.

(d) Shares not Treated as Both Preferred Stock and Common
Stock in any Distribution. Shares of Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to be converted into shares
of Common Stock in order to participate in any distribution, or series of distributions, as shares of

A-4

Benvenue Medical - Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (Series F)_(palib2_7678050_4)
Common Stock, without first foregoing participation in the distribution, or series of distributions, as
shares of Preferred Stock.

(e) Determination of Value if Proceeds Other than Cash. In any
Liquidation, if the proceeds received by the Company or its stockholders are other than cash, its
value will be deemed its fair market value. Any securities shail be valued as follows:

(i) Securities not subject to investment letter or other
similar restrictions on free marketability covered by (ii) below:

(A) _ If traded on a securities exchange, the value
shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange or system
over the twenty (20) trading-day period ending three (3) trading days prior to the closing of the
Liquidation;

(B) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value
shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the
twenty (20) trading-day period ending three (3) trading days prior to the closing of the Liquidation;
and

(C) If there is no active public market, the value
shall be the fair market value thereof, as determined and approved by the Board of Directors of the
Company.

(ii) | The method of valuation of securities subject to
investment letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by
virtue of a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate
discount from the market value determined as above in (i) (A), (B) or (C) to reflect the approximate
fair market value thereof, as determined and approved by the Board of Directors of the Company.

(f) Allocation of Different Forms of Proceeds. In any Liquidation,
if the proceeds received by the Company or its stockholders are comprised of any combination of
cash, promissory notes, securities and/or other property (each, a “Form of Proceeds”), then each
Form of Proceeds shall be distributed pro rata in such priority and amounts as required to satisfy
(i) the Liquidation Preferences specified in Section 2(a) above, and (ii) if available after payment of
the full preferential amounts specified in Section 2(a), the distribution of the remaining assets in
accordance with Section 2(b) above. For example, if the proceeds of a Liquidation are comprised of
fifty percent (50%) each of cash and stock the Form of Proceeds used to satisfy the Liquidation
Preferences specified in Section 2(a) above shall be fifty percent (50%) cash and fifty percent (50%)
stock and the remaining amount, if any, distributed in accordance with Section 2(b) above shall also
be fifty percent (50%) cash and fifty percent (50%) stock.

(g) Allocation of Contingent Consideration. In the event of a
Liquidation pursuant to Subsection 2(c), if any portion of the consideration payable to the

stockholders of the Company is payable only upon satisfaction of contingencies (the “Additional
Consideration”), the Board of Directors and the operative agreements shail provide that (a) the

A-5

Benvenue Medical - Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (Series F)_ (palib2_7678050_4)
portion of such consideration that is not Additional Consideration (such portion, the “Initial
Consideration”) shall be allocated among the holders of capital stock of the Company in accordance
with Subsections 2(a) and 2(b) as if the Initial Consideration were the only consideration payable in
connection with such Liquidation and (b) any Additional Consideration which becomes payable to
the stockholders the Company upon satisfaction of such contingencies shall be allocated among the
holders of capital stock of the Company in accordance with Subsections 2(a) and 2(b) after taking
into account the previous payment of the Initial Consideration as part of the same transaction. For
the purposes of this Subsection 2(g), consideration placed into escrow or retained as holdback to be
available for satisfaction of indemnification or similar obligations in connection with such
Liquidation shall not be deemed Additional Consideration.

3. Conversion. The Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as
follows:

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be
convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share at
the office of the Company or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock. Each share of Series A-1
Preferred shall be convertible into that number of fully-paid and nonassessable shares of Common

“Series A-1 Conversion Price” shall initially be $2.92, and shall be subject to adjustment as
provided herein. Each share of Series B-1! Preferred shall be convertible into that number of fully-
paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock that is equal to $7.02 divided by the Series B-1
Conversion Price (as hereinafter defined). The “Series B-1 Conversion Price” shall initially be
$7.02, and shall be subject to adjustment as provided herein. Each share of Series C Preferred shall
be convertible into that number of fully-paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock that is
equal to $1.00 divided by the Series C Conversion Price (as hereinafter defined). The “Series C
Conversion Price” shall initially be $1.00, and shall be subject to adjustment as provided herein.
Each share of Series D Preferred shall be convertible into that number of fully-paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock that is equal to $1.00 divided by the Series D Conversion

be subject to adjustment as provided herein. Each share of Series E Preferred shall be convertible
into that number of fully-paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock that is equal to $1.05
divided by the Series E Conversion Price (as hereinafter defined). The “Series E Conversion
Price” shall initially be $1.05, and shall be subject to adjustment as provided herein. Each share of
Series F Preferred shall be convertible into that number of fully-paid and nonassessable shares of
Common Stock that is equal to $0.65 divided by the Series F Conversion Price (as hereinafter
defined)The “Series F Conversion Price” shall initially be $0.65, and shall be subject to adjustment
as provided herein.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall
automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the then effective Conversion Price for
each series immediately upon (1) the date or event set forth in an election of holders of at least two-
thirds (2/3) of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class (on an as-
converted to Common Stock Basis), provided however, that if such conversion is to occur in
connection with a Liquidation, such conversion shall not be effective as to the Series F Preferred Stock
unless approved by holders of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the Series F Preferred Stock then outstanding,

A-6

Benvenue Medical - Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (Series F)_(palib2_7678050_4)
or (2) the consummation of a firmly underwritten public offering pursuant to the Securities Act, on
Form S-1 or any successor form, provided, however, that the per share price to the public is not less
than $2.00 (as adjusted for stock splits, combinations, reorganizations and the like) and the aggregate
gross proceeds (before deduction of underwriters commissions and expenses) to the Company are not
less than $40,000,000 (either (1) or (2), in connection with an initial public offering of the Company’s
shares, a “Qualified Public Offering”).

(c) Mechanics of Conversion.

(i) No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued
upon conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would
otherwise be entitled, the Company shall pay the fair market value cash equivalent of such fractional
share as determined and approved by the Board of Directors. For such purpose, all shares of
Preferred Stock held by each holder shall be aggregated by series, and any resulting fractional shares
of Common Stock shall be paid in cash. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
convert the same into full shares of Common Stock, and to receive certificates therefor, he shall
surrender the Preferred Stock certificate or certificates, duly endorsed, at the office of the Company
or of any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the Company at such
office that such holder elects to convert such shares; provided, however, that in the event of an
automatic conversion pursuant to paragraph 3(b) above, the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock
shall be converted automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and
whether or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Company or its
transfer agent; provided further, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to issue
certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such automatic conversion unless
either the certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are delivered to the Company or its
transfer agent as provided above, or the holder notifies the Company or its transfer agent that such
certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the
Company to indemnify the Company from any loss incurred by it in connection with such
certificates.

(ii) | The Company shall, as soon as practicable after
delivery of the Preferred Stock certificates, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of
Preferred Stock, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which he
shall be entitled and a check payable to the holder in the amount of any cash amounts payable as the
result of a conversion into fractional shares of Common Stock, plus any declared or accumulated but
unpaid dividends on the converted Preferred Stock. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been
made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of
Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common
Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders
of such shares of Common Stock on such date; provided, however, that if the conversion is in
connection with an underwritten offer of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act, the
conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned
upon the closing of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering, in which event the person(s)
entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of the Preferred Stock shall not
be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of the sale
of such securities.

Benvenue Medical - Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (Series F)_(palib2_7678050_4)
(d) Adjustments to Conversion Price.

(i) Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of
Common. After the date of the filing of this Eighth Restated Certificate of Incorporation, if the
outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided (by stock split, stock dividend or
otherwise), into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Series A-1 Conversion Price, the
Series B-1 Conversion Price, the Series C Conversion Price, the Series D Conversion Price, the
Series E Conversion Price and the Series F Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such
subdivision shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such subdivision, be proportionately
decreased. After the date of the filing of this Eighth Restated Certificate of Incorporation, if the
outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined (by reclassification or otherwise) into a
lesser number of shares of Common Stock, the Series A-1 Conversion Price, the Series B-1
Conversion Price, the Series C Conversion Price, the Series D Conversion Price, the Series E
Conversion Price and the Series F Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such combination
shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination, be proportionately increased.

(ii) Adjustments for Reclassification, Exchange and
Substitution. If the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be

changed into the same or a different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock, whether
by capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of
shares provided for above), the Series A-1 Conversion Price, the Series B-1 Conversion Price, the
Series C Conversion Price, the Series D Conversion Price, the Series E Conversion Price and the
Series F Conversion Price then in effect shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such
reorganization or reclassification, be proportionately adjusted such that the Preferred Stock shall be
convertible into, in lieu of the number of shares of Common Stock which the holders would
otherwise have been entitled to receive, a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock
equivalent to the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been subject to receipt by the
holders upon conversion of the Series A-1 Preferred, Series B-1 Preferred, Series C Preferred,
Series D Preferred, Series E Preferred or Series F Preferred immediately before that change.

(iii) Adjustments for Dilutive Issuances.

(A) After the date of the filing of this Eighth
Restated Certificate of Incorporation, if the Company shall issue or sell any shares of Common
Stock (as actually issued or, pursuant to paragraph (C) below, deemed to be issued) for a
consideration per share less than the Series C Conversion Price, the Series D Conversion Price, the
Series E Conversion Price or the Series F Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issue
or sale, then:

(1) The Series C Conversion Price, Series D
Conversion Price, Series E Conversion Price and Series F Conversion Price, as applicable, shall be
reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated and rounded upward to the nearest tenth
of a cent) determined by multiplying the then existing Series C Conversion Price, Series D
Conversion Price, Series E Conversion Price and Series F Conversion Price, as applicable (the
existing Series C Conversion Price, Series D Conversion Price, Series E Conversion Price and Series
F Conversion Price, the “Prior CP” as applicable) by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the

A-8

Benvenue Medical - Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (Series F)_(patib2_7678050_4)
number of shares of “Calculated Securities” (as defined below) outstanding immediately prior to
such issue or sale plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration
received by the Company for the total number of shares of Common Stock so issued or sold (or
deemed to be issued or sold) would purchase at the Prior CP (the “New Investment Shares”), and
the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Calculated Securities outstanding
immediately prior to such issue or sale plus the number of shares of Common Stock so issued or sold
(the “New Shares”). “Calculated Securities” means the sum of (A) all shares of Common Stock
actually outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale; and (B) all shares of Common Stock
issuable upon exercise, conversion or exchange of all Convertible Securities actually outstanding
immediately prior to such issue or sale. This equation is reflected in the following formula:

New CP = Prior CP x (Calculated Securities + New Investment Shares)
(Calculated Securities + New Shares)

(2) The Series A-1 Conversion Price and
Series B-1 Conversion Price shal] be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated
and rounded upward to the nearest tenth of a cent) determined by multiplying the percentage by
which the Series C Conversion Price and Series D Conversion Price are reduced pursuant to
paragraph (A)(1) above, and subtracting such amount from the then existing Series A-1 Conversion
Price and Series B-1 Conversion Price, as applicable.

(B) For the purposes of paragraph (A) above, none
of the following issuances shall be considered the issuance or sale of Common Stock:

(1) — The issuance of Common Stock upon the
conversion of the Preferred Stock, or the issuance of Common Stock upon the conversion of any
other Convertible Securities that are outstanding as of the date of filing of this Eighth Restated
Certificate of Incorporation. “Convertible Securities” shall mean any bonds, debentures, notes or
other evidences of indebtedness, and any warrants, options, shares (including, but not limited to,
shares of Preferred Stock) or any other securities convertible into, exercisable for, or exchangeable
for Common Stock.

(2) The issuance of any Common Stock or
Convertible Securities as a dividend on the Company’s stock or as part of a stock split or
recapitalization of the Company, if such issuance is approved by the Board of Directors.

(3) The issuance of shares of Common
Stock (or options or warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock) to employees, directors or
consultants of the Company under the Company’s 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (as may be amended
from time to time) or another stock plan or program approved by the Board of Directors.

(4) The issuance of shares of Common
Stock or Convertible Securities to lenders, financial institutions, equipment lessors, or real estate

(5) The issuance of Common Stock or
Convertible Securities pursuant to the acquisition of another business by the Company by merger,
purchase of substantially all of the assets or shares, or other reorganization whereby the Company or

business or the acquisition of technology or other intellectual property by outright purchase or
exclusive license, if such transaction and such issuance are approved by the Board of Directors.

Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement dated on or about the date of the filing of this Eighth Restated
Certificate of Incorporation.

(11) The issuance of shares of Common
Stock or Convertible Securities in a transaction other than as described in (1) through (10) above,
provided that such issuance is approved in writing by the holders of at least two-thirds of the
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock.

(C) _ For the purposes of paragraph (A) above, the
following subparagraphs | to 3, inclusive, shall also be applicable:

(1) Incase at any time the Company shall
grant any rights to subscribe for, or any rights or options to purchase, Convertible Securities,
whether or not such rights or options or the right to convert or exchange any such Convertible

the exercise of such rights or options or upon conversion or exchange of the total maximum amount
of such Convertible Securities issuable upon the exercise of such rights or options shall (as of the

Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred
Stock, such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect
the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of
all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, the Company will take such corporate action as
may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of
Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.
