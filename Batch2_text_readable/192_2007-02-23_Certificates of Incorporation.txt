At the time this amendment and restatement of the Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation becomes effective (the “Effective Time’), pursuant to the DGCL, and without any
further action on the part of the Corporation or its stockholders: (i) the Corporation’s Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Old Common
Stock’) shall be converted into shares of the Common Stock and combined at the rate of one
share of Common Stock for each twenty shares of Old Common Stock, so as to effect a one-for-
twenty reverse split; (ii) the Corporation’s Series A Preferred Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Old Series A Preferred Stock”) shall be converted
into shares of the Series A Preferred Stock and combined at the rate of 0.1273 shares of Series A
Preferred Stock for each share of Old Series A Preferred Stock, so as to effect a 0.1273-for-one
reverse split; and (iii) the Corporation’s Series B Convertible Preferred Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Old Series B Preferred Stock”) shall
be converted into shares of the Series B Preferred Stock and combined at the rate of 0.0753
shares of Series B Preferred Stock for each share of Old Series B Preferred Stock, so as to effect
a 0.0753-for-one reverse split. At the Effective Time, the certificates representing shares of the
Old Common Stock, the Old Series A Preferred Stock and the Old Series B Preferred Stock shall

N
be decmed cancelled and shall not be recognized as outstanding on the books of the Corporation
for any purpose. Thereupon: (1) there shall be issued and delivered to each holder of Old
Common Stock, promptly in such holder’s name and at the address as shown on the records of
the Corporation, a certificate for the number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of
Old Common Stock were converted and combined, (ii) there shall be issued and delivered to
each holder of the Old Series A Preferred Stock, promptly in such holder’s name and at the

Preferred Stock, promptly in such holder’s name and at the address as shown on the records of
the Corporation, a certificate for the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock into which the

fractional shares shall result from the Effective Time Reverse Splits (as defined below) and any
fractional share of Common Stock, Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock that
would be deemed to be held of record at the Effective Time shall be rounded down to the next

Preferred Stock or Old Series B Preferred Stock would be deemed to hold only a fraction of one
share of Common Stock, Series A Preferred Stock or Serics B Preferred Stock after giving effect
to the Effective Time Reverse Splits, then, in lieu of recording on its books such fractional share,
the Corporation shall pay cash in an amount equal to the fair market value of such fraction, as
determined by the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the “Board’). The foregoing reverse
splits of the Common Stock, the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock shall
be referred to herein as the “Effective Time Reverse Splits.”

B. Rights, Preferences and Restrictions of Preferred Stock. The rights, preferences,

restrictions and other matters relating to the Preferred Stock are as follows:
1. Dividends.

(a) Shares of Series C Preferred Stock and Series C-1 Preferred Stock. The
holders of shares of the Series C Preferred Stock and Series C-1 Preferred Stock shall be entitled
to receive cumulative dividends with respect to each such share of Series C Preferred Stock and
Series C-1 Preferred Stock at the rate of nine percent per annum, compounded annually, on (i)
the Original Series C Issue Price (as defined below) (as adjusted for any stock dividends,
combinations, splits, recapitalizations and similar events with respect to such shares of Series C
Preferred Stock), with respect to the shares of Series C Preferred Stock and (ii) the Original
Series C-1 Issue Price (as defined below) (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations,
splits, recapitalizations and similar events with respect to such shares of Series C Preferred
Stock), with respect to the shares of Series C-1 Preferred Stock. Such dividends shall accrue
from the date of original issuance of such share of Series C Preferred Stock or Series C-1
Preferred Stock, as the case may be, whether or not there are (at the time such dividend is
calculated or becomes payable or at any other time) funds of the Corporation legally available
for the payment of dividends. As used herein, with respect to a share of Series C Preferred Stock
or Series C-! Preferred Stock, the date on which the Corporation shall initially issue such share
of Series C Preferred Stock or Series C-] Preferred Stock shall be deemed its “date of original
issuance,” regardless of the number of times the transfer of such share shal! be made on the
Corporation’s stock transfer records and regardless of the number of certificates that may be
issued to evidence such shares. Cumulative dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock and Series
C-1] Preferred Stock shall become payable only when and if declared by the Board or when such
dividends otherwise become payable pursuant to Section B.2 or B.6 of Article IV of this Third
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (this “Certificate”). All dividends declared
upon the Series C Preferred Stock and Series C-] Preferred Stock shall be declared and paid pro
rata per share based upon the respective date of original issuance thereof.

(b) Participation Right. In the event that the Board shall declare a dividend
with respect to the Common Stock, the holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive,
when and as declared by the Board, out of any assets of the Corporation legally available
therefor, dividends which shall be distributed among all holders of Common Stock and Preferred
Stock in proportion to the number of shares of Common Stock held by each such holder as if all
shares of Preferred Stock were converted into Common Stock at the then effective Applicable
Conversion Price (as defined below) for each respective series of Preferred Stock. No dividend
or distribution shall be declared or paid on any shares of Common Stock unless at the same time
an equivalent dividend or distribution is declared or paid on all outstanding shares of Preferred
Stock.

(c) Limitations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Certificate, as long as any share of Series C Preferred Stock or Series C-1 Preferred Stock
remains outstanding, no dividend shall be declared or paid upon, nor shal] any distribution be
made upon, the Series B Preferred Stock, the Series A Preferred Stock or the Common Stock if,
at the time, (i) dividends that accrued with respect to the Series C Preferred Stock or Series C-1
Preferred Stock shall remain unpaid, or (ii) any other payment or distribution on or with respect
to any share of Series C Preferred Stock or Series C-! Preferred Stock, or portion thereof, that
shall theretofore have been due from the Corporation shall remain unpaid.

2. Liquidation Preference.

(a) Distributions upon Liquidation. In the event of any liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, either voluntary or involuntary (including, without
limitation, upon any bankruptcy), distributions to the stockholders of the Corporation shall be
made in the following manner:

(i) the holders of Series C Preferred Stock shall receive, on a par with
the holders of Series C-1 Preferred Stock, and prior and in preference to any other distribution of
any of the assets or funds of the Corporation to holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock and Common Stock, for each share of Series C Preferred Stock held, the sum of
(A) $3.61623 (the “Original Series C Issue Price”) (as adjusted for any stock dividends,
combinations, splits, recapitalizations and similar events with respect to such shares of Series C
Preferred Stock) multiplied by one and five-tenths, plus (B) any accrued but unpaid dividends on
such share (such sum, the “Series C Preference Amount’); provided, however, that in the event
that amounts payable to a holder of Series C Preferred Stock with respect to a share of Series C
Preferred Stock in connection with any such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation, as calculated pursuant to this Section B.2(a)(i), together with amounts payable to
such holder pursuant to Section B.2(a)(v) below, would exceed three times the Original Series C
Issue Price (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and
similar events with respect to shares of Series C Preferred Stock), the one and five-tenths
multiplier referred to above shall instead be one for purposes of determining the Series C
Preference Amount.

(ii) the holders of Series C-1 Preferred Stock shall receive, on a par
with the holders of Series C Preferred Stock, and prior and in preference to any other distribution
of any of the assets or funds of the Corporation to holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series
B Preferred Stock and Common Stock, for each share of Series C-] Preferred Stock held, the
sum of (A) $3.61623 (the “Original Series C-1 Issue Price”) (as adjusted for any stock
dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and similar events with respect to such shares
of Series C-1 Preferred Stock), plus (B) any accrued but unpaid dividends on such share (such
sum, the “Series C-1 Preference Amount’),

(iii) the holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall receive, on a par with
the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, and prior and in preference to any distribution of any of
the assets or funds of the Corporation to holders of the Common Stock, for each share of Series
B Preferred Stock held, the sum of (A) $5.3273 per share of Series B Preferred Stock (the
“Original Series B Issue Price”) (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits,
recapitalizations and similar events with respect to such shares of Series B Preferred Stock other
than the Effective Time Reverse Splits) plus (B) an amount equal to nine percent of the Original
Series B Issue Price (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations
and similar events with respect to such shares of Series B Preferred Stock other than the
Effective Time Reverse Splits), compounded annually on each September 30, from the date on
which the first share of Series B Preferred Stock was issued (the “Series B Purchase Date”)
through and including the earlier of (x) the date of the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of
the Corporation and (y) the date that is three years after the Series B Purchase Date (such sum,
the “Series B Preference Amount’);

(iv) the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall receive, on a par with
the holders of Series B Preferred Stock, and prior and in preference to any distribution of any of
the assets or funds of the Corporation to holders of the Common Stock, for each share of Series
A Preferred Stock held, the sum of (A) $4.7946 per share of Series A Preferred Stock (the
“Original Series A Issue Price’’) (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits,
recapitalizations and similar events with respect to such shares of Series A Preferred Stock other
than the Effective Time Reverse Splits) plus (B) an amount equal to nine percent of the Original
Series A Issue Price (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations
and similar events with respect to such shares of Series A Preferred Stock other than the
Effective Time Reverse Splits), compounded annually on each September 30, from the Series B
Purchase Date through and including the earlier of (x) the date of the liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation and (y) the date that is three years after the Series B Purchase
Date (such sum, the “Series A Preference Amount’); and

(v) after payment has been made to the holders of the Preferred Stock
of the full amounts to which they shall be entitled as provided in Sections B.2(a)(i) through (iv)
above, the entire remaining assets and funds of the Corporation legally available for distribution,
if any, shall be distributed among the holders of the Preferred Stock and Common Stock pro rata
based on the number of shares of Common Stock held by such holder, treating each share of
Preferred Stock as having been converted to Common Stock pursuant to Section B.3
immediately prior to such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation.

(b) Allocation of Payments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in Section B.2(a) of this Certificate, in the event that the assets and funds legally available
for distribution to the stockholders of the Corporation are insufficient to pay the Series C
Preference Amount in respect of each share of Series C Preferred Stock and the Series C-1
Preference Amount in respect of each share of Series C-1 Preferred Stock as described above,
then all funds or assets legally available for distribution shall be distributed to the holders of
Series C Preferred Stock and Series C-1 Preferred Stock pro rata based on the dollar amount to
which they are otherwise entitled under Section B.2(a). In the event that, after payment of the
Series C Preference Amount and the Series C-1 Preference Amount in full, the assets and funds
legally available for distribution to the stockholders of the Corporation are insufficient to pay the
Series A Preference Amount in respect of each share of Series A Preferred Stock and the Series
B Preference Amount in respect of each share of Series B Preferred Stock as described above,
then all remaining funds or assets legally available for distribution shall be distributed to the
holders of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock pro rata based on the dollar
amount to which they are otherwise entitled under Section B.2(a).

(c) Sale Transaction. (i) For purposes of this Section B.2, unless otherwise
agreed in writing by the holders of at least seventy-five percent of the outstanding shares of
Series C Preferred Stock (the “Required Holders’), a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of
the Corporation shall be deemed to be occasioned by, and to include: (A) any acquisition of the
Corporation by another person, trust or entity (or group of persons, trusts or entities) by means of
any transaction or series of transactions (including, without limitation, any reorganization,
consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into any other entity) (x) in which the holders
of the Corporation’s outstanding capital stock immediately before the first such transaction do
not, immediately after any other such transaction, retain stock or other equity interests
representing at least fifty percent of the voting power of the surviving entity of such transaction
or (y) after which any such person or entity and its affiliates hold more than fifty percent of the
voting power of the Corporation’s outstanding capital stock; or (B) any sale, conveyance,
exclusive license or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation or all or
substantially all of the intellectual property of the Corporation (any such transaction, a “Sale
Transaction”). Unless otherwise agreed upon by the Required Holders, no stockholder of the
Corporation shall enter into any transaction or series of related transactions resulting in a
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation pursuant to the terms hereof unless the
terms of such transaction or transactions provide that the consideration to be paid to the
stockholders of the Corporation is to be allocated in accordance with the preferences and
priorities set forth in this Section B.2.

(ii) —_ In the event of any Sale Transaction, if the consideration received
by the Corporation is other than cash, its value will be deemed its fair market value as
determined by the Board and approved by the Required Holders. Any securities shall be valued
as follows:

(A) Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar
restrictions on free marketability covered by (B) below:
(1) If traded on a securities exchange or through NASDAQ
National Market System, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the
securities on such exchange over the thirty-day period ending three days prior to the closing;

(2) If traded over-the-counter, the value shall be deemed to be
the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the thirty-day period
ending three days prior to the closing; and

(3) If there is no public market. the value shall be the fair
market value thereof, as determined by the Board and approved by the Required Holders.

(B) The method of valuation of securities subject to investment letter
or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue ofa
stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shal! be to make an appropriate discount
from the market value determined as above in subsection (A)(1), (2) or (3) to reflect the
approximate fair market value thereof, as determined by the Board and approved by the Required
Holders.

(iii) In the event that there is more than one type of consideration
payable to the Corporation or its stockholders in connection with any Sale Transaction, the
holders of the Preferred Stock may elect, by the written consent or vote of the Required Holders,
to receive one or more specified types of consideration in respect of the Series C Preference
Amount, the Series C-1 Preference Amount, the Series B Preference Amount and the Series A
Preference Amount. Such type or types of consideration and the respective amounts of such
types of consideration to be received by the holders of Preferred Stock in respect of the Series C
Preference Amount, the Series C-1 Preference Amount, the Series B Preference Amount and the
Series A Preference Amount shall be determined by the Required Holders.

3. Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion
rights as follows:

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at
the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share, at the office
of the Corporation or any transfer agent for such stock, into fully paid and nonassessable shares
of Common Stock of the Corporation. The number of shares of Common Stock into which each
share of Series C Preferred Stock may be converted shall be determined by dividing the Orginal
Series C Issue Price (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations
and similar events with respect to such shares of Series C Preferred Stock) by the Applicable
Conversion Price for the Series C Preferred Stock in effect on the date that the holder thereof
elects to convert such share. The initial Applicable Conversion Price of the Series C Preferred
Stock is the Original Series C Issue Price (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations,
splits, recapitalizations and similar events with respect to such shares of Series C Preferred
Stock). The number of shares of Common Stock into which each share of Series C-1 Preferred
Stock may be converted shal] be determined by dividing the Original Series C-1 Issue Price (as
adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and similar events with
respect to such shares of Series C-1 Preferred Stock) by the Applicable Conversion Price for the
Series C-1] Preferred Stock in effect on the date that the holder thereof elects to convert such
share. The initial Applicable Conversion Price of the Series C-1 Preferred Stock is the Original
Series C-1 Issue Price (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations
and similar events with respect to such shares of Series C-1 Preferred Stock). The number of
shares of Common Stock into which each share of Series B Preferred Stock may be converted
shall be determined by dividing the Original Series B Issue Price (as adjusted for any stock
dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and similar events with respect to such shares
of Series B Preferred Stock other than the Effective Time Reverse Splits) by the Applicable
Conversion Price for the Series B Preferred Stock in effect on the date that the holder thereof
elects to convert such share. The initial Applicable Conversion Price of the Series B Preferred
Stock is the Original Series B Issue Price. The number of shares of Common Stock into which
each share of Series A Preferred Stock may be converted shall be determined by dividing the
Original Series A Issue Price (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits,
recapitalizations and similar events with respect to such shares of Series A Preferred Stock other
than the Effective Time Reverse Splits) by the Applicable Conversion Price for the Series A
Preferred Stock in effect on the date that the holder thereof elects to convert such share. The
initial Applicable Conversion Price of the Series A Preferred Stock is the Original Series A Issue
Price. The Applicable Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock is subject to
adjustment from the date on which the first share of Series C Preferred Stock was issued (the
“Series C Purchase Date’’) as set forth in this Section B.3.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically
be converted into shares of Common Stock (as set forth in Section B.3(a)) upon the earlier of (i)
the consummation of a firm commitment underwritten public offering of Common Stock
registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (x) at a public offering price of not less
than $10.84869 per share (as adjusted for stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations
and similar events other than the Effective Time Reverse Splits) (y) resulting in net proceeds to
the Corporation of not less than $20,000,000 and (z) after which the Common Stock is listed on a
national securities exchange (a “QJPO”’) and (ii) the date specified by written consent of the
Required Holders. Such conversion shall be automatic, without need for any further action by
the holders of shares of Preferred Stock and regardless of whether the certificates representing
such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent; provided, however, that the
Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion unless certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock so
converted are surrendered to the Corporation or the holder of record of such shares notifies the
Corporation that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and such holder executes an
agreement to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such
certificates, in each case in accordance with the procedures described in Section B.3(c) below.
Upon the conversion of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section B.3(b), the Corporation shall
promptly send written notice thereof, by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested and
postage prepaid, by hand delivery or by overnight delivery, to each holder of record of Preferred
Stock at such holder’s address then shown on the records of the Corporation, which notice shal]
state that certificates evidencing shares of Preferred Stock must be surrendered at the office of
the Corporation (or of its transfer agent for the Common Stock, if applicable) in the manner
described in Section B.3(c) below.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shal]] be
entitled to receive certificates representing shares of Common Stock into which shares of
Preferred Stock are converted pursuant to this Section B.3, such holder shall surrender the
certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any
transfer agent for the Preferred Stock (or such holder notifies the Corporation that such
certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and such holder executes an agreement to
indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates), and
shall give written notice to the Corporation at such office of the name or names in which the
certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued. The Corporation shall, as
soon as practicable and in no event later than ten days after the delivery of said certificates, issue
and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or nominees of
such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such
holder shall be entitled as aforesaid. The person or persons entitled to receive the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion pursuant to this Section B.3 shall be treated for all
purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock as of the effective date
of such conversion. Ifthe conversion is in connection with an underwritten offering of securities
registered pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any Sale Transaction, the
conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering Preferred Stock for conversion, be
conditioned upon the closing with the underwntters of the sale of securities pursuant to such
offering or the closing of such Sale Transaction, in which event the person(s) entitled to receive
the Common Stock upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have
converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities or
the closing of such Sale Transaction.

(d) Conversion Price Adjustments for Certain Dilutive Issuances, Splits and
Combinations. The Applicable Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock shall be
subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

6) (A) Inthe event that the Corporation shall issue or sell, at any
time, or from time to time, after the Series C Purchase Date, any Additional Stock (as defined
below) without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Applicable
Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to the issuance of
such Additional Stock, the Applicable Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock in
effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall be reduced, concurrently with such issuance
or sale, to a price determined by multiplying the Applicable Conversion Price for such series of
Preferred Stock by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the sum of (x) the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale and (y) the number
of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration actually received by the
Corporation for such Additional Stock so issued would purchase at the Applicable Conversion
Price for such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale, and
the denominator of which shall be equal to the sum of (x) the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale and (y) the number of shares of
Additional Stock (calculated on an as converted to Common Stock basis) so issued or sold or
deemed to be issued or sold. For the purpose of the above calculation, the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale shall be calculated as if all
shares of Preferred Stock and all vested securities that are then exercisable for or convertible into
shares of Common Stock had been fully exercised for or converted into shares of Common Stock
as of such time.
(B) Except to the limited extent provided for in Sections 3(d)(i)(E)(3)
and (E)(4), no adjustment of any Applicable Conversion Price of any senes of Preferred Stock
pursuant to this Section 3(d) shall have the effect of increasing the Applicable Conversion Price
for such series of Preferred Stock above the Applicable Conversion Price for such series of
Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such adjustment.

(C) In the case of the issuance or sale of Additional Stock for cash, the
consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor after deducting any
discounts, commissions or other expenses paid or incurred by the Corporation in connection with
the issuance or sale thereof.

(D) In the case of the issuance or sale of the Additional Stock for a
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be
deemed to be the fair market value thereof as of the date of issuance, as determined in good faith
by the Board and the Required Holders, irrespective of any accounting treatment. The issuance
or sale of Options (as defined below) or Convertible Securities (as defined below) together with
other securities of the Corporation in an integrated transaction in which no specific consideration
is allocated to such Options or Convertible Securities shall be deemed to be issuance of shares of
Common Stock at no consideration. In the case of issuance or sale of the Additional Stock
together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for consideration that
includes both cash and non-cash consideration, the consideration shall be the proportion of such
consideration received, computed as provided in clause (C) above and this clause (D).

(E) In the event that the Corporation at any time or from time to time
after the Senes C Purchase Date shall issue any securities by their terms convertible into or
exchangeable for Common Stock (“Convertible Securities”) or any options, rights or warrants to
subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire Common Stock or Convertible Securities
(“Options”) or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities
then entitled to receive any such Options or Convertible Securities, the following provisions shall
apply for all purposes of this Section B.3(d)(i) and Section B.3(d)(ii):

(1) The aggregate maximum number of shares of Common
Stock deliverable upon exercise of such Options, assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to
exercisability (including, without limitation, the passage of time), shall be deemed to be
Additional Stock issued at the time such Options were issued and for a consideration equal to the
consideration (determined in the manner provided in Sections B.3(d)({i)(C) and B.3(d)(i)(D)), if
any, received by the Corporation upon the issuance of such Options plus the minimum exercise
price provided in such Options.

(2) The aggregate maximum number of shares of Common
Stock deliverable upon conversion of or in exchange for such Convertible Securities or upon the
exercise of Options for such Convertible Securities and subsequent conversion or exchange
thereof, assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to convertibility or exchangeability and
exercisability (including, without limitation, the passage of time), shal] be deemed to be
Additional Stock issued at the time such Convertible Securities were issued or such Options for
Convertible Securities were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration, if any,
received by the Corporation for any such Convertible Securities and related Options, plus the

10
minimum additional consideration, if any, to be received by the Corporation upon the conversion
or exchange of such Convertible Securities or the exercise of any related Options (the
consideration in each case to be determined in the manner provided in Sections 3(d)(i)(C) and

3(d)G)(D)).

(3) In the event of any change in the number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon exercise of
such Options or upon conversion of or in exchange for such Convertible Securities (including,
without limitation, a change resulting from the antidilution provisions thereof), the Applicable
Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock to the extent in any way affected by or
initially determined using such Options or Convertible Securities shall be recomputed to reflect
such change.

(4) Upon the expiration of any such Options, the Applicable
Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock to the extent in any way affected by the
issuance of such Options shall be recomputed to reflect the issuance of only the number of shares

administrative or investigative (hereinafter a “proceeding’’), by reason of the fact that he or she is
or was a director or officer of the Corporation or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries or is or
was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of any
other corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service
with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an “indemnitee’”), whether the basis of such
proceeding 1s alleged action in an official capacity as a director or officer or in any other capacity
while serving as a director or officer, shall be indemnified and be held harmless by the
Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be
amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, and unless the DGCL or other applicable law
otherwise requires, only to the extent that such amendment pemnits the Corporation to provide
broader indemnification rights than permitted prior thereto), against all expense, liability and loss
(including attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines, excise or other taxes assessed with respect to an
employee benefit plan, penalties, and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered
by such indemnitee in connection therewith, and such indemnification shall continue as to an

defending any proceeding for which such right to indemnification is applicable in advance of its
final disposition (hereinafter in “advancement of expenses”); provided, however, that, if the
DGCL requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as

indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses), it shal] be a defense that the
indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the DGCL, and
(11) any suit by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of
an undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final
adjudication that the indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth
in the DGCL. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including the Board, its independent legal
counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such
suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee
has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by
the Corporation (including the Board, its independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the
indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the
indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought
by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a
right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or by the Corporation to
recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of
proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses
under this Article VI or otherwise, shall be on the Corporation.

Dz. Nonexclusive Rights. The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of
expenses conferred in this Article VI shall not be exclusive of any other right that any person
may have or hereafter acquire under any statutes, this Certificate, by-law, agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

E. Insurance. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect
itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether
or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense,
liability or loss under the DGCL.

F. Other Services. The Corporation’s obligation, if any, to indemnify any person
who was or is serving as a director, officer, employee or agent of any direct or indirect subsidiary
of the Corporation or, at the request of the Corporation, of any other corporation or of a
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise shall be reduced by any amount such person

22
may collect as indemnification from such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise.

G. Amendment or Repeal. Any amendment, repeal or modification of the foregoing
provision of this Article VI shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director or
officer existing at the time of, or increase the liability of any director of the Corporation with
respect to any acts or omissions of such director or officer or occurring prior to, such
amendment, repeal, modification or adoption.

supplement adopted by the stockholders.

ARTICLE XII

The property and assets of the stockholders of the Corporation shall not, to any extent
whatsoever, be subject to the payment of the debts of the Corporation.

ARTICLE XIII

Pursuant to Section 122(17) of the DGCL, the Corporation hereby renounces any interest
or expectancy of the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation in, or in being offered an

23
Opportunity to participate in, any and all business opportunities that are presented to the holders
of Series C Preferred Stock, Series C-1 Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock or their
affiliates (including, without limitation, any representative or affiliate of such holders of Series C
Preferred Stock, Series C-1 Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock serving on the Board or
on the board of directors or other governing body of any subsidiary of the Corporation (each a
“Board of Directors’) (collectively, the “Purchaser Parties”). Without limiting the foregoing
renunciation, the Corporation on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries (a) acknowledges that the
Purchaser Parties are in the business of making investments in, and have or may have
investments in, other businesses similar to and that may compete with the businesses of the
Corporation and its subsidiaries (“Competing Businesses’) and (b) agrees that the Purchaser
Parties shall have the unfettered right to make investments in or have relationships with other
Competing Businesses independent of their investments in the Corporation. By virtue of a
Purchaser Party holding capital stock of the Corporation or by having persons designated by or
affiliated with such Purchaser Party serving on or observing at meetings of any Board of
Directors or otherwise, no Purchaser Party shall have any obligation to the Corporation, any of
its subsidiaries or any other holder of capital stock or securities of the Corporation to refrain
from competing with the Corporation and any of its subsidiaries, making investments in or
having relationships with Competing Businesses, or otherwise engaging in any commercial
activity and none of the Corporation, any of its subsidiaries or any other holder of capital stock
or securities of the Corporation shall have any right with respect to any investment or activities
undertaken by such Purchaser Party. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Purchaser Party
may engage in or possess any interest in other business ventures of any nature or description,
independently or with others, similar or dissimilar to the business of the Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries, and none of the Corporation, any of its subsidiaries or any other holder of capital
stock or securities of the Corporation shall have any rights or expectancy by virtue of such
Purchaser Parties’ relationships with the Corporation, or otherwise in and to such independent
ventures or the income or profits derived therefrom; and the pursuit of any such ventures, even if
such investment is in a Competing Business, shall not for any purpose be deemed wrongful or
improper. No Purchaser Party shall be obligated to present any particular investment opportunity
to the Corporation or its subsidiaries even if such opportunity is of a character that, if presented
to the Corporation or such subsidiary, could be taken by the Corporation or such subsidiary, and
each Purchaser Party shall continue to have the right for its own respective account or to
recommend to others any such particular investment opportunity. Nothing set forth in this
Article XIII shall limit any confidentiality obligation applicable to any member of a Board of
Directors.
