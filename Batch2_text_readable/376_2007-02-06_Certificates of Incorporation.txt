corporation or other entity or person, or any other corporate reorganization or similar transaction,
in which the stockholders of the Corporation immediately prior to such consolidation, merger or
reorganization or similar transaction, shall, immediately thereafter own less than 50% (calculated

securities immediately after such consolidation, merger or reorganization, or any transaction or
series of related transactions in which in excess of 50% of the Corporation’s voting or equity
securities are transferred (excluding any voting or equity securities issued by the Corporation or

transaction or series of transactions for the purpose of raising additional capital or retiring debt),
and (ii) an “Asset Transfer’ shall mean the sale, conveyance, transfer, exclusive license, lease or
other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation (an “Asset Transfer’).
Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, any event that would otherwise be

Acquisition or an Asset Transfer, if (x) the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, Series F-|
Preferred Stock, Series G Preferred Stock, Series H Preferred Stock and Series I Preferred Stock,
voting together as a single class on an as-converted to Common Stock basis, and (y) the holders
of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series F Preferred Stock (voting as a separate class), so
agree.

(d) Distributions of Property. In the event of a Liquidating Event under this
Section (B)2, if the consideration received by the Corporation is other than cash, its value will be
its fair market value (as determined below). Any securities shal] be valued as follows:

(i) Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar
restrictions on free marketability covered by Section (B)2(d)(ii) below:

(A) If traded on a securities exchange or the Nasdaq Stock
Market, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on
such exchange or quotation system over the five day trading period ending three trading days
prior to the closing of the transaction;

(B) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing bid prices over the five day trading period ending three
trading days prior to the closing of the transaction; and

(C) If there is no active public market, the value shall be the
fair market value thereof, as determined by the Board and approved by the holders of a majority
of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class. If such
approval is not obtained within 10 business days after the Board first notifies such holders, in
writing, of the valuation proposed by the Board, then, within five business days after the
expiration of the preceding 10 business day period, the Board and the holders of a majority of the
then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class, shall mutually
appoint a nationally recognized accounting firm or reputable valuation firm with experience in
the appraisal of the types of assets at issue to appraise the fair market value of the securities. If
the Board and the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting
together as a single class, are unable, within, such five business day period, to agree upon a
nationally recognized accounting firm or reputable valuation firm to perform the appraisal, then,
within an additional five business days thereafter, each of (i) the Board, and (ii) the holders of a
majority of the then outstanding Preferred Stock, shall appoint one accounting firm or reputable
valuation firm, and each of those firm(s) shall appoint another accounting firm or reputable
valuation firm, which third firm shall perform the appraisal. If the final appraisal is within 10%
of the value proposed by the Board, then the cost of such appraisal will be borne proportionally
by the holders of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock requesting such appraisal, based
upon the value of their respective holdings. If the final appraisal varies by more than 10% from
the value proposed by the Board, then the Corporation shall bear the cost of the appraisal.

(ii) | The method of valuation of securities subject to investment letter
or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of a
stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount
from the market value determined as above in Section (B)2(d)(i) to reflect the approximate fair
market value thereof, as determined by the Board.

(e) Spin-offs. In the event of a spin-off or similar event, the Corporation shall
establish a similar capital structure for the newly formed entity as then in effect for the
Corporation in order to protect the rights, preferences and privileges of the Preferred Stock.

3, VOTING RIGHTS. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, including but
not limited to Article 6, or by law, the holder of each share of Preferred Stock shall have the right
to one vote for each share of Common Stock into which such Preferred Stock could then be
converted, and with respect to such vote, such holder shall have full voting rights and powers
equal to the voting rights and powers of the holders of Common Stock, and shall be entitled,
notwithstanding any provision hereof, to notice of any stockholders’ meeting in accordance with
the bylaws of the Corporation, and shall be entitled to vote, together with holders of the Common
Stock, with respect to any question upon which holders of Common Stock have the right to vote.
Fractional votes shall not, however, be permitted and any fractional voting rights available on an
as-converted basis (after aggregating all shares of Common Stock into which shares of Preferred
Stock held by each holder could be converted) shall be rounded to the nearest whole number
(with one-half being rounded upward). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) the
holders of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote as a separate class on any amendment to
this Tenth Amended and Restated Certificate, as it may be amended or restated from time to
time, that increases or decreases the number of authorized shares of Common Stock and (ii)
subject to the requirements set forth in Section (B)4 hereof, the number of authorized shares of
Common Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares of Common
Stock then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class on an as-
converted to Common Stock basis.

written notice to the Corporation and stating therein the quantity of New Securities to be

not thereafter issue or sell any such New Securities without again first offering such securities to

above shall expire upon and not include the Corporation’s initial public offering registered under
the 1933 Act prior to or in connection with which all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock will

Preferred Stock to participate in the Corporation’s initial public offering.

(f) Transfer of Preemptive Rights. The preemptive rights granted to each

outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred
Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, Series F Preferred Stock, Series F-1 Preferred Stock, Series G
Preferred Stock, Series H Preferred Stock and Series I Preferred Stock would be converted if
fully converted immediately prior to such sale or issuance of Additional Stock (but not taking
into account any anti-dilution provisions triggered by such sale or issuance of Additional Stock),
plus (2) the quotient obtained by dividing: (x) the aggregate consideration received by the
Corporation (calculated pursuant to Section (B)7(e)(i)(C) and (D) below) by: (y) the Series B
Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the deemed issuance of such Additional Stock.
plus (3) the number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock immediately prior to the
deemed issuance of Additional Stock (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations,
recapitalizations or the like); and the denominator of which shall be the sum of (1) the number of
shares of Common Stock into which the then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock,
Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, Series F Preferred
Stock, Series F-1 Preferred Stock, Series G Preferred Stock, Series H Preferred Stock and
Series | Preferred Stock would be converted if fully converted immediately prior to such sale or
issuance of Additional Stock (but not taking into account any anti-dilution provisions triggered
by such sale or issuance of Additional Stock), plus (2) the number of issued and outstanding
shares of Common Stock immediately prior to the deemed issuance of Additional Stock (as
adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, recapitalizations or the like), plus (3) the number
of shares of such Additional Stock issued or deemed issued pursuant to Section (B)7(e)(1)(E)
below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any adjustment to the Series B Conversion Price

21
resulting from the issuance of Additional Stock pursuant to this Section would result in an
adjustment to the Series B Conversion Price which is greater than a fraction, the numerator of
which shall be sum of (1) the number of shares of Common Stock into which the then
outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred
Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, Series F Preferred Stock, Series F-1 Preferred Stock, Series G
Preferred Stock, Series H Preferred Stock and Series 1 Preferred Stock would be converted if
fully converted immediately prior to such sale or issuance of Additional Stock (but not taking
into account any anti-dilution provisions triggered by such sale or issuance of Additional Stock),
plus (2) the quotient obtained by dividing: (x) the aggregate consideration received by the
Corporation (calculated pursuant to Section (B)7(e)(i)(C) and (D) below) by: (y) the Series F
Original Purchase Price (subject to adjustment for stock dividends, combinations, splits,

Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, Series F Preferred
Stock, Series F-] Preferred Stock, Series G Preferred Stock, Series H Preferred Stock and
Series I Preferred Stock would be converted if fully converted immediately prior to such sale or
issuance of Additional Stock (but not taking into account any anti-dilution provisions triggered
by such sale or issuance of Additional Stock), plus (2) the number of shares of such Additional
Stock issued or deemed issued pursuant to Section (B)7(e)(i)(E) below (the “Junior Preferred
Anti-Dilution Adjustment Cap’), then the Series B Conversion Price shall be adjusted to the
extent of the Junior Preferred Anti-Dilution Adjustment Cap and no further. For the avoidance
of doubt, if the issuance of Additional Stock would result in a Series B Conversion Price equal to
95% of the Series B Conversion Price prior to such issuance (but for application of the previous
sentence) and the Junior Preferred Anti-Dilution Adjustment Cap for such issuance were 97%,
then the Series B Conversion Price resulting from such issuance would, in such case, be equal to
97% of the Series B Conversion Price prior to such issuance.

(2) Series C Preferred Stock. If the Corporation shall
issue, after the date hereof, any Additional Stock without consideration or for a consideration per
share less than the Series F Original Purchase Price (subject to adjustments for stock dividends,

immediately prior to each such issuance shall automatically (except as otherwise provided in this
Section (B)7(e)(i)) be adjusted to a price determined by multiplying such Series C Conversion
Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the sum of (1) the number of shares of
Common Stock into which the then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, Series F Preferred Stock,
Series F-1 Preferred Stock, Series G Preferred Stock, Series H Preferred Stock and Series |
Preferred Stock would be converted if fully converted immediately prior to such sale or issuance
of Additional Stock (but not taking into account any anti-dilution provisions triggered by such
sale or issuance of Additional Stock), plus (2) the quotient obtained by dividing: (x) the
aggregate consideration received by the Corporation (calculated pursuant to Section
(B)7(e)(i)(C) and (D) below) by: (y) the Series C Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to
the deemed issuance of such Additional Stock; and the denominator of which shall be the sum of
(1) the number of shares of Common Stock into which the then outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock,
Series F Preferred Stock, Series F-1 Preferred Stock, Series G Preferred Stock, Series H
Preferred Stock and Series I Preferred Stock would be converted if fully converted immediately

22

prior to such sale or issuance of Additional Stock (but not taking into account any anti-dilution
provisions triggered by such sale or issuance of Additional Stock), plus (2) the number of shares
of such Additional Stock issued or deemed issued pursuant to Section (B)7(e)(i)(E) below.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any adjustment to the Series C Conversion Price resulting from
the issuance of Additional Stock pursuant to this Section would result in an adjustment to the
Series C Conversion Price which is greater than the Junior Preferred Anti-Dilution Adjustment
Cap, then the Series C Conversion Price shall be adjusted to the extent of the Junior Preferred
Anti-Dilution Adjustment Cap and no further. For the avoidance of doubt, if the issuance of
Additional Stock would result in a Series C Conversion Price equal to 95% of the Series C
Conversion Price prior to such issuance (but for application of the previous sentence) and the
Junior Preferred Anti-Dilution Adjustment Cap for such issuance were 97%, then the Series C
Conversion Price resulting from such issuance would, in such case, be equal to 97% of the Series
C Conversion Price prior to such issuance.

(3) Series D Preferred Stock. If the Corporation shal]
issue, after the date hereof, any Additional Stock without consideration or for a consideration per
share less than the Series F Original Purchase Price (subject to adjustments for stock dividends,
combinations, splits, recapitalizations or the like), the Series D Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to each such issuance shall automatically (except as otherwise provided in this
Section (B)7(e)(i)) be adjusted to a price determined by multiplying such Series D Conversion
Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the sum of (1) the number of shares of
Common Stock into which the then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, Series F Preferred Stock,
Series F-] Preferred Stock, Series G Preferred Stock, Series H Preferred Stock and Series |
Preferred Stock would be converted if fully converted immediately prior to such sale or issuance
of Additional Stock (but not taking into account any anti-dilution provisions triggered by such
sale or issuance of Additional Stock), plus (2) the quotient obtained by dividing: (x) the
aggregate consideration received by the Corporation (calculated pursuant to Section
(B)7(e)(i)(C) and (D) below) by: (y) the Series D Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to
the deemed issuance of such Additional Stock; and the denominator of which shall be the sum of
(1) the number of shares of Common Stock into which the then outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock,
Series F Preferred Stock, Series F-1 Preferred Stock, SeriesG Preferred Stock, Series H
Preferred Stock and Series | Preferred Stock would be converted if fully converted immediately
prior to such sale or issuance of Additional Stock (but not taking into account any anti-dilution
provisions triggered by such sale or issuance of Additional Stock), plus (2) the number of shares
of such Additional Stock issued or deemed issued pursuant to Section (B)7(e){i)(E) below.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any adjustment to the Series D Conversion Price resulting from
the issuance of Additional Stock pursuant to this Section would result in an adjustment to the
Series D Conversion Price which is greater than the Junior Preferred Anti-Dilution Adjustment
Cap, then the Series D Conversion Price shal! be adjusted to the extent of the Junior Preferred
Anti-Dilution Adjustment Cap and no further. For the avoidance of doubt, if the issuance of
Additional Stock would result in a Series D Conversion Price equal to 95% of the Series D
Conversion Price prior to such issuance (but for application of the previous sentence) and the
Junior Preferred Anti-Dilution Adjustment Cap for such issuance were 97%, then the Series D
Conversion Price resulting from such issuance would, in such case, be equal to 97% of the Series
D Conversion Price prior to such issuance.

23
(4) Series F Preferred Stock. If the Corporation shall
issue, after the date upon which any shares of Series F Preferred Stock were first issued (the
“Series F Issue Date”), any Additional Stock without consideration or for a consideration per
share less than the Series F Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such
Additional Stock, the Series F Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to each such
issuance shall automatically (except as otherwise provided in this Section (B)7(e)(i)) be adjusted
to a price equal to the consideration per share of the Additional Stock so issued: provided,
however, that Additional Stock issued or sold (or deemed issued or sold) without consideration
shall be deemed to have been sold for $0.001 per share.

(5) Series F-1 Preferred Stock. If the Corporation shall
issue, after the date hereof, any Additional Stock without consideration or for a consideration per
share less than the Series F Original Purchase Price (subject to adjustments for stock dividends,
combinations, splits, recapitalizations or the like), the Series F-1 Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to each such issuance shall automatically (except as otherwise provided in this
Section (B)7(e)(i)) be adjusted to a price determined by multiplying such Series F-1 Conversion
Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the sum of (1) the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such sale or issuance of Additional Stock (but
not taking into account any anti-dilution provisions triggered by such sale or issuance of
Additional Stock) with such number of shares of Common Stock being determined on a fully-
diluted and as converted basis (determined as if all Preferred Stock had been fully converted into
Common Stock, and (x) all options or warrants to purchase or rights to subscribe for capital
stock of the Corporation, and (y) all indebtedness and securities, by their terms convertible into
or exchangeable for capital stock of the Corporation or options to purchase or rights to subscribe
for such convertible or exchangeable securities, had all (as described in such (x) and (y)) been
fully converted or exercised into shares of Common Stock (and if such securities or instruments
are exercisable for a security of the Corporation, other than Common Stock, then determined as
if the resulting securities were fully converted into shares of Common Stock, if so convertible)
immediately prior to such sale or issuance of Additional Stock), plus (2) the quotient obtained by
dividing: (x) the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation (calculated pursuant to
Section (B)7(e)(i)(C) and (D) below) by: (y) the Series F-1 Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to the deemed issuance of such Additional Stock; and the denominator of
which shall be the sum of (1) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to such sale or issuance of Additional Stock (but not taking into account any anti-dilution
provisions triggered by such sale or issuance of Additional Stock) with such number of shares of
Common Stock being determined on a fully-diluted and as converted basis (determined as if all
Preferred Stock had been fully converted into Common Stock, and (x) all options or warrants to

(but not taking into account any anti-dilution provisions triggered by such sale or issuance of
Additional Stock), plus (2) the number of shares of such Additional Stock issued or deemed
issued pursuant to Section (B)7(e)(i)(E) below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any

24
adjustment to the Series F-1 Conversion Price resulting from the issuance of Additional Stock
pursuant to this Section would result in an adjustment to the Series F-] Conversion Price which
is greater than the Junior Preferred Anti-Dilution Adjustment Cap, then the Series F-1
Conversion Price shall be adjusted to the extent of the Junior Preferred Anti-Dilution Adjustment
Cap and no further. For the avoidance of doubt, if the issuance of Additional Stock would result
in a Series F-] Conversion Price equal to 95% of the Series F-1 Conversion Price prior to such
issuance (but for application of the previous sentence) and the Junior Preferred Anti-Dilution
Adjustment Cap for such issuance were 97%, then the Series F-1 Conversion Price resulting

to such issuance.

issue, after the date hereof, any Additional Stock without consideration or for a consideration per
share less than the Series G Original Purchase Price (subject to adjustments for stock dividends,
combinations, splits, recapitalizations or the like), the SeriesG Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to each such issuance shall automatically (except as otherwise provided in this
Section (B)7(e)(i)) be adjusted to a price determined by multiplying such Series G Conversion
Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the sum of (1) the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such sale or issuance of Additional Stock (but
not taking into account any anti-dilution provisions triggered by such sale or issuance of

or exchangeable for capital stock of the Corporation or options to purchase or rights to subscribe
for such convertible or exchangeable securities, had all (as described in such (x) and (y)) been
fully converted or exercised into shares of Common Stock (and if such securities or instruments

Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the sum of (1) the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such sale or issuance of Additional Stock (but
not taking into account any anti-dilution provisions triggered by such sale or issuance of
Additional Stock) with such number of shares of Common Stock being determined on a fully-
diluted and as converted basis (determined as if all Preferred Stock had been fully converted into

Price, the Series F Conversion Price, the Series F-1 Conversion Price, Series G Conversion Price,
Series H Conversion Price and the Series 1 Conversion Price, to the extent in any way affected by

Price, Series H Conversion Price or Series | Conversion Price above the Series B Conversion
Price, Series C Conversion Price, Series D Conversion Price, Series F Conversion Price,

number of shares of Series F Preferred Stock, Series F-1 Preferred Stock, Series G Preferred
Stock, Series H Preferred Stock and/or Series I] Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such
Redemption Date, then those funds that are legally available will be used to redeem the

Stock, shares of Series G Preferred Stock, shares of Series H Preferred Stock and shares of Series
I Preferred Stock from all holders of Series F Preferred Stock, all holders of Series F-1 Preferred
Stock, all holders of Series G Preferred Stock, all holders of Series H Preferred Stock and all
holders of Series 1 Preferred Stock (except for the shares held by the Non-Redeeming Series

Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock on any Redemption Date are
insufficient to redeem the total number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred
Stock and Series D Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such Redemption Date, then those funds

shares of Series D Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock from holders thereof who have
requested redemption pro rata based on the aggregate Redemption Price of such shares held by
each such holder; and (ii) second, if funds remain legally available after redemption of all the

Corporation has become obligated to redeem on any Redemption Date but which it has not
redeemed according to the priority set forth above, and such funds will not be used for any other
purpose, including the redemption of any shares of Preferred Stock that the Corporation is
obligated to redeem on any subsequent Redemption Date.

(f) From and after each Redemption Date, unless there shall have been a
default in payment of the Redemption Price or the Corporation is unable to pay the Redemption
Price due to not having sufficient legally available funds therefor, all rights of the holders of such
shares as holders of Preferred Stock (except the right to receive the Redemption Price without
interest upon surrender of their certificates) shall cease and terminate with respect to such shares;
provided, however, that in the event that shares of Preferred Stock are not redeemed due to a
default in payment by the Corporation or because the Corporation does not have sufficient
legally available funds therefor, such shares of Preferred Stock shall remain outstanding and
shall be entitled to all of the rights and preferences provided herein.

(g) Any shares of Preferred Stock which are redeemed or otherwise acquired
by the Corporation will be cancelled and will not be reissued, sold or transferred.

(h) The “Appraised Value” of any shares of Series B Preferred Stock,

redeemed hereunder shall be the fair market value of such shares, respectively, as established by
the Board in good faith immediately following and as of the date of receipt of the applicable
Second Redemption Notice, plus any declared but unpaid dividends on such shares (which fair
market value shall not include a discount for minority ownership interest or illiquidity). The

Series B Preferred Stock; (ii) with respect to the Series C Preferred Stock, a majority of the then
outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock; (iii) with respect to the Series D Preferred Stock,
a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock; or (iv) with respect to the
Series F Preferred Stock, a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series F Preferred Stock;

prior to the first Redemption Date that they disagree with the Appraised Value for any shares of
Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock and/or Series F
Preferred Stock as determined by the Board, then the Objecting Holders and the Board shall
altempt to agree upon the Appraised Value. Should the Objecting Holders and the Board be
unable to agree during the 20 day period immediately following the giving of the written notice
of such disagreement as to the Appraised Value without the employment of appraisers, then the
Appraised Value shall be determined by appraisal. If the Objecting Holders and the Corporation

39
agree upon one appraiser within 15 days after failing to agree to the Appraised Value, the
appraisal shall be conducted by such appraiser. If the Objecting Holders and the Corporation are
unable to agree upon one appraiser within such 15-day period, then they shall each select an
appraiser experienced in the business of evaluating or appraising the market value of stock and
