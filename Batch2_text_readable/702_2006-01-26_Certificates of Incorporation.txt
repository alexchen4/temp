c. Conversion Price. As of the Original Issue Date (as hereinafter
defined), the conversion price for the Series A Preferred shall be the Series A Original issue Price (the
“Series A Conversion Price”). As of the Original Issue Date, the conversion price for the Series B
Preferred shall be $1.8925 (the “Series B Conversion Price”). As of the Original Issue Date, the
conversion price for the Series C Preferred shall be the Series C Original Issue Price (the “Series C
Cerversion Price”). As of the Original Issue Date, the conversion price for the Series D Preferred shal!

(the “Series E Conversion Price”). Such initial Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price,
Series C Conversion Price, Series D Conversion Price and Series E Conversion Price, as the case may be,
shall be referred to as the “Series Preferred Conversion Price” and shall be adjusted from time to time in
accordance with this Section 4. All references to the Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion
Price, Series C Conversion Price, Series D Conversion Price, Series E Conversion Price and Series
Preferred Conversion Price herein at any date shall mean the Series A Conversion Price, Series B

Series Preferred Conversion Price, respectively, as so adjusted as of such date.

d. Mechanics of Conversion. Each holder of Series Preferred who desires
to convert the same into shares of Common Stock pursuant to this Section 4 shall surrender the certificate
or certificates therefor (or if such holder shall notify the Company or its transfer agent that such
certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and indemnity agreement
reasonably acceptable to the Company), duly endorsed, at the office of the Company or any transfer
agent for the Series Preferred. and sha!l giv. written notice to the Company at such office that such
holder elects tc convert the same. Such notice shall state the number cf shares of Serics Preferred being,
converted. Thereupon, the Company shall promptly issue and deliver at such office to such holder a
certificate or certificates for the number of shares cf Common Stock to which such aolder is entitled,
together with cash in lieu of any fraction of a share and as payment for any declared and unpaid
dividends on the shares of Series Preferred being converted. Such conversion shall be deemed to have
been made at the close of business on the date of such surrender of the certificates (or lost certificate
affidavit and indemnity agreement, if necessary) representing the shares of Series Preferred to be
converted, and the person entit'ed to receive the shares 0, Common Stock issuable upon such conversion
shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such shares of Common Stock on such date.

e. Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If the Company shal!
at any time or trom time to time after the date that the first share of Series E Preferred is issued (the
“Qriginal Issue Date”) effect a subdivision of the outstanding Common Stock, the applicable Series
Preferred Conversion Price in effect immediately before that subdivision shall be proportionately
decreased, so that the holder of any share of Serics Preferred thereafter surrendered for conversion shall
be entitled to receive (in lieu of the number of shares of Common Stock that the holders would otherwise
have been entitled to receive) the number of shares of Common Stock or other securities of the Company
that such holder would have owned or would have been entitled to receive upon or by reason of any of
the events described above, had such share of Series Preferred been converted immediately prior to the
occurrence of such event. Conversely, if the Company shall at any time or from time to time after the
Original Issue Date combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares,
the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price in effect immediately before the combination shall be
proportionately increased, so that the holder of any share of Series Preferred thereafter surrendered for
conversion shall be entitled to receive (in lieu of the number of shares of Common Stock that the holders
would otherwise have been entitled to receive) the number of shares of Common Stock or other securities
of the Company that such holder would have owned or would have been entitled to receive upon or by
reason of any of the events described above, had such share of Series Preferred been converted

564370 WS/HIN 10.
immediately prior to the occurrence of such event. Any adjustment under this Section 4(e) shall become
effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes efiective.

f. Adjustment for Common Stock Dividends and Other Distributions.

(A) If the Company at any time or from time to time after the
Original Issue Date makes, or fixes a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock
entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of Coimmon Stock, in
each such event the Scries Preferred Conversion Price that is then in effect shall be decreased as of ihe
time of such issuance or, in the event such record date is fixed, as of the close of busines: on such record
date, by mu.uplying the Series Preferred Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction (:) the numerator
of which is the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immedi:tely prior to the
time of such issuance or the close of business on such record date, and (ii) the denominator of which is
the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of
such issuance or the close of business on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution; provided, however, that if such record date is fixed
and such dividend is not fully paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the
Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such
record date and thereafter the Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this Section
4(f) to reflect the actual payment of such dividend or distribution.

(B) If the Company shall at any time or from time to time,
distribute to any holders of shares of Common Stock (including any such distribution made in connection
with a merger or consolidation in which the Corporation is the resulting or surviving Person and the
Common Stock is not changed or exchanged) cash, evidence of indebtedness of the Company or another
issuer, securities of the Company (other than Common Stock) or another issuer or other assets (excluding
cash dividends in which holders of shares of Series Preferred participate in the manner provided in
Section | above and dividends payable in shares of Common Stock for which adjustment is made under
paragraph (A) above) or rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase of any of the foregoing, then, and
in each such case, the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price, then in effect shall be decreased (and
any other appropriate actions shall be taken by the Company) by multiplying each such Series Preferred
Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the date of such distribution by a fraction (x) the
numerator of which shall be the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board) of the
Common Stock immediately prior to the date of distribution less the fair market value (as determined in
good faith by the Board) of the portion of the cash, evidences of indebtedness, securities or other assets
so distributed or of such rights or warrants applicable to one share of Common Stock and (y) the
denominator of which shall be the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board) of the
Common Stock immediately prior to the date of distribution (but such fraction shall not be greater than
one). Such adjustment shall be made whenever any such distribution is made and shall become effective
retroactively to a date immediately following the close of business on the record date for the
determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution.

g. Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchaage and Substitution. If at
any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date, the Common Stock issuable upon the
conversion of the Scries Preferred is changed into the same or a different number of shares of any class
or classes of stock, whether by recapitalization, reclassification or otherwise (other than an Acquisition
or Asset Transfer as defined in Section 3(d) or a subdivision or combination of shares or stock dividend
Or a reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale of assets provided for elsewhere in this Section 4), in
any such event, the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price then in effect shall, concurrently with
the effectiveness of such recapitalization or reclassification, be adjusted so that each holder of Series

$64370 v5:HIN 11.
Preferred shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of the Series Preferred, the kind and
amount of stock or other securities and property receivable upon such recapitalization, reclassification or
other change, which such holder of Series Preferred would have owned or would have been entitled to
receive upon or by reason of such recapitalization, reclassification or other change, had such share of
Series Preferred been converted to Common Stock immediately prior to the occurrence of such event. In
any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 4
with respect to the rights of the holders of Series Preferred after the capital reorganization to the end that
the provisions of this Section 4 (including adjustment of the Series Preferred Conversion Price then in
effect and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Serics Preferred) shall be applicable
after that event and be as nearly equivalent as practicable.

h. Adjustment for Reorganizations, Mergers, Consolidations or Sales
of Assets. If at any time or from time to time after the Original Jssue Date, there is a capital
reorganization of the Common Stock (other than an Acquisition or Asset Transfer as defined in Section
3(d) or a recapitalization, subdivision, combination, reclassification, exchange or substitution of shares
provided for elsewhere in this Section 4), as a part of such capital reorganization, provisions shall be
made so that the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price then in effect shall, concurrently with the
effectiveness of such reorganization, be adjusted so that the holders of the Series Preferred shall
thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of the S .cies Preferred the kind and amount of stock or
other securities and property receivable upon such reorganization, which such holder of Series Preferred
would have owned or would have been entitled to receive upon or by reason of such reorganization had
such shares of Series Preferred been converted to Common Stock immediately prior to such event. In
any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 4
with respect to the rights of the holders of Series Preferred after the capital reorganization to the end that
the provisions of this Section 4 (including adjustment of the Series Preferred Conversion Price then in
effect and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Series Preferred) shal! be applicable
after that event and be as nearly equivalent as practicable. Compliance with this Section 4(h) shall be a
condition for any capital reorganization or reclassification.

i. Adjustment for Sale of Shares Below Series Preferred Conversion
Price.

(i) If at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date,
the Company issues or sells, or is deemed by the express provisions of this Section 4(i) to have issued or
sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock (as defined below), other than as provided in Section 4(f), 4g)
or 4(h) above, for an Effective Price (as defined below) less than the then effective Series C Conversion
Price, Series D Conversion Price, or Series E Conversion Price (a “Qualifying Dilutive Issuance”), then
and in each such case, the then existing Series C Conversion Price, Serics D Conversion Price or Series E
Conversion Price, as the case may be, shall be reduced, as of the opening of business on the date of such
issue or sale, to a price determined by multiplying the Series C Conversion Price, Series D Conversion
Price or Series E Conversion Price, as the case may be, in effect immedisiely prior to such issuance or
sale by a fraction:

(A) the numerator of which shall be (A) the number of shares of
Series Preferred deemed outstanding (as determined below) immediately prior to such issue or sale, plus
(B) the number of shares of Common Stock which the Aggregate Consideration (as defined below)
received or deemed received by the Company for the total number of Additional Shares of Common
Stock so issued would purchase at such then-existing Series Preferred Conversion Price, and

564370 vSIN 12
(B) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of
Series Preferred deemed outstanding (as determined below) immediately prior to such issue or sale plus
the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued.

For the purposes of the preceding sentence, the number of shares of Series Preferred deemed to
be outstanding as of a given date shall be the number of shares of Commen Steck into which the then
outstanding shares of Series Preferred could be converted if fully converted on the day immediately
preceding the given date.

(ii) No adjustment shall be made to the Series Preferred Conversion
Price in an amount less than one cent per share. Any adjustment otherwise required by this Section 4(i)
that is not required to be made due to the preceding sentence shall be included in any subsequent
adjustment to the Series Preferred Conversion Price. For the avoidance of doubt, no adjustment shall be
made to the Series B Conversion Price under this Section 4(i) in connection with the issuance of
17,000,000 shares of Series E Preferred (or the issuance of Common Stock upon the conversion of such
shares of Series E Preferred). For the purpos2 of making any adjustment required under this Section 4(i),
the aggregate consideration received by the Company for any issue or sale of securities (the “Aggregate
Consideration”) shall be defined as: (A) to the extent it consists of cash, be computed at the gross amount
of cash received by the Company before deduction of any underwriting or similar commissions,
compensation or concessions paid or allowed by the Company in connection with such issue or sale and
without deduction of any expenses payable by the Company, (B) to the extent it consists of property
other than cash, be computed at the fair value of that property as determined in good faith by the Board,
and (C) if Additional Shares of Common Stock, Convertible Securities (as defined below) or rights or
options to purchase either Additional Shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities are issued or
sold together with other stock or securities or other assets of the Company for a consideration which
covers both, be computed as the portion of the consideration so received that may be reasonably
determined in good faith by the Board to be allocable to such Additional Shares of Common Stock,
Convertible Securities or rights or options.

(iii) For the purpose of the adjustment required under this
Section 4(i), if the Company issues or sells (x) Preferred Stock or other stock, options, warrants, purchase
rights or other securities convertible into, Additional Shares of Common Stock (such convertible stock or
securities being herein referred to as “Convertible Securities”) or (y) rights or options for the purchase of
Additiona! Shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities and if the Effective Price of such
Additional Shares of Common Stock is less than the Series Preferred Conversion Price, in each case, the
Company shall be deemed to have issued at the time of the issuance of such rights or options or
Convertible Securities the maximum number of Additional Shares of Common Stock issuable upon
exercise or conversion thereof and to have received as consideration for the issuance of such shares an
amount equal to the total amount of the consideration, if any, seceived by the Company for the issuance
of such rights or options or Convertible Securities plus:

(A) in the case of such rights or options, the minimum amounts
of consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon the exercise of such rights or options; and

(B) in the case of Convertible Securities, the minimum amounts
of consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon the conversion thereof (other than by cancellation
of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities); provided, that if the minimum
amounts of such consideration cannot be ascertained, bul are a function of antidilution or similar
protective clauses, the Company shall be deemed to have received the minimum amounts of
consideration without reference to such clauses.

$64370 VSN 13.
(iv) If the minimum amount of consideration payable to the
Company upon the exercise or conversion of rights, options or Convertible Securities is reduced over
time or on the occurrence or non-occurrence of specified events cther than by reason of antidilution
adjustments, the Effective Price shall be recalculated using the figure to which such minimum amount of
consideration is reduced; provided, further, that if the minimum amount of consideration payable to the
Company upon the exercise or conversion of such rights, options or (Convertible Securities is
subsequently increased, the Effective Price shall be again recalculated using the increased minimum
amount of consideration payable to the Company upon the exercise or conversion of such sights, options
or Convertible Securities, provided, that such recalculation shall not apply to prior conversions of Series
Preferred.

(v) No further adjustment of the Series Preferred Conversion Price,
as adjusted upon the issuance of such rights, options or Convertible Securities, shall be made as a result
of the actual issuance of Additional Shares of Corimon Stock or the exercise of any such rights or
options or the conversion of any such Convertible Securities. If any such rights or options or the
conversion privilege represented by any such Convertible Securities shall expire without having been
exercised, the Series Preferred Conversion Price as adjusted upon the issuance of such rights, options or
Convertible Securitics shall be readjusted to the Series Preferred Conversion Price which would have
been in effect had an adjustment been made on the basis that the only Additional Shares of Common
Stock so issued were the Additional! Shares of Common Stock, if any, actually issued or sold on the
exercise of such rights or options or rights of conversion of such Convertible Securities, and such
Additional Shares of Common Stock, if any, wcre issued or sold for the consideration actually received
by the Company upon such exercise, plus the consideration. if any, actually received by the Company for
the granting of all such rights or cptions, whether or not exercised, plus the consideration received for
issuing or selling the Convertible Securities actually converted, plus the consideration, if any, actually
received by the Company (other than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such
Convertible Securities) on the conversion of such Convertible Securities, provided, that such
readjustment shall not apply to prior conversions of Scries Preferred.

(vi) | For the purpose of making any adjustment to the Conversion
Price of the Series Preferred required under this Section 4(i), “Additional Shares of Common Stock”
shall mean all shares of Common Stock issued by the Company or deemed to be issued pursuant to this
Section 4(i) (including shares of Common Stock subsequently reacquired or retired by the Company),

splits, recapitalizations and the like) issued after the Original Issue Date to employees, officers or
directors of, or consultants or advisors to the Company or any subsidiary, pursuant to stock purchase or
stock option plans or other arrangements that are approved by the Board; provided, that without
increasing the Plan Shares, any shares that revert back or are otherwise available for reissuance in
connection with the expiration or termination of any option shall be available for issuance by the
Company and will not be considered Additional Shares of Common Stock,

(C)} shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to the exercise of
Convertible Securities outstanding as of the Original Issue Date;

dividing the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock issued or sold, or deemed to have been
issued or sold by the Company under this Section 4(i), into the Aggregate Consideration received, or
deemed to have been received by the Company for such issue under this Section 4(i), for such Additional
Shares of Common Stock. In the event that the number of shares of Additional Shares of Common Stock
or the Effective Price cannot be ascertained at the time of issuance, the Board shall in gcod faith
determine the maximum number of Additional Shares of Common Stock and the minimum amount of
consideration, subject to adjustment under Section 4(v).

(vii) In the event that the Company issues or sells, or is deemed to
have issued or sold, Additional shares of Common Stock in a Qualifying Dilutive Issuance (the “First
Dilutive Issuance’), then in the event that the Company issues or sells, or is deemed to have issued or
sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock in a Qualifying Dilutive Issuance other than the First Dilutive
Issuance as a part of the same transaction or series of related transactions as the First Dilutive Issuance,
and such issuance occurs within a period of no more than 30 days from the date of the First Dilutive
Issuance (a “Subsequent Dilutive Issuance”), then and in cach such case upon a Subsequent Dilutive
Issuance the Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be reduced to the Series Preferred Conversion Price
that would have been in effect had the First Dilutive Issuance and each Subsequent Dilutive Issuance all

or winding up.

L Automatic Conversion.

(i) Each share of Series Preferred sha!l automatically be converted
into shares of Common Stock, based on the then-effective Series Preferred Conversion Price,
immediately upon the closing of a firmly underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act, covering the offer and sale of Common Stock for the
account of the Company in which (i) the aggregate valuation of the Company at the time of the offering
(based on the per share price to the public in the registration statement multiplied by the outstanding
shares on a fully-diluted basis) is equal to or greater than two hundred million dollars ($200,000,000) (ii)
the gross cash proceeds to the Company (before underwriting discounts, commissions and fees) are at
least forty million dollars ($40,000,000), and (iii) the Common Stock is to be listed for trading on either
the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq National Market. Upon such automatic conversion, any
declared and unpaid dividends shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of Section 4(d).

(ii) Upon the occurrence of the event specified in paragraph
(i) above, the applicable outstanding shares of Series Preferred shall be converted automatically without
any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates representing such
shares are surrendered to the Company or its transfer agent; provided, however, that the Company shall
not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such
conversion unless the certificates evidencing such shares of Series Preferred are cither delivered to the
Company or its transfer agent as provided below, or the holder notifies the Company or its transfer agent
that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the
Company to indemnify the Company from any loss incurred by it in connection with the replacement of
such certificates. Upon the occurrence of such automatic conversion of the Series Preferred, all holders
of the Series Preferred sha!l be given notice of the automatic conversion pursuant to this Section 4(1),
including the effective date on which such action took place and the then effective Series Preferred
Conversion Price. Upon receipt of such notice, the holders of Series Preferred shall surrender the
certificates (or lost certificate agreement) representing such shares at the office of the Company or any
transfer agent for the Series Preferred. Thereupon, there shall be issued and delivered to such holder
promptly at such office and in its name as shown on such surrendered certificate or certificates, a
certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Series
Preferred surrendered were convertible on the date on which such automatic conversion occurred, and

$6437 V5.9 N 16.
any declared and unpaid dividends shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of Section 4(d). If the
conversion is in connection with an underwritten offering of securities registered pursuant to the
Securities Act or the closing of any other specified transaction, the conversion may, at the option of any
holder tendering Series Preterred for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters
of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering or the closing of such transactions, in which event the
persons entitled to receive the Common Stock upon conversion of the Series Preferred shall not be
deemed to have converted such Series Preferred until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of
securities or such other event.

m, Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be
issued upon conversion of Series Preferred. All shares of Common Stock (including fractions thereof)
issuable upon conversion of more than one share of Series Preferred by a holder thereof shall be
aggregated for purposes of determining whether the conversion would result in the issuance of any
fractional share. If, after the aforementioned aggregation, the conversion would result in the issuance of
any fractional share, the Company shall, in licu of issuing any fractional share, pay cash equal to the
product of such fraction multiplied by the Common Stock’s fair market value (as determined by the
Board) on the date of conversion.

n. Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Company shall
at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock, solely
for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Series Preferred, such number of its shares
of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding
shares of the Series Preferred. If at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common
Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Series
Preferred, in addition to such other remedies as shall be available to the holder of such Series Preferred,
the Company will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to
increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be
sufficient for such purpose, including without limitation, engaging in commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to these Restated Articles of
Incorporation. Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment reducing any Series Preferred
Conversion Price below the then par value of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of
the Series Preferred, the Company will take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its
counsel, be necessary in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock at such adjusted Series Preferred Conversion Price.

0. Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Section 4 shall be
in writing and shall be deemed effectively given: (i) upon personal delivery to the party to be notified, (ii)
when sent by confirmed telex or facsimile as provided for under applicable sections of the California

address within the United States, or (iv) one (1) business day after deposit with a nationally recognized
overnight courier, specifying next day delivery, with written verification of receipt. All notices shall be
addressed to cach holder of record at the address of such holder appearing on the books of the Company.

p- Payment of Taxes. The Company will pay all taxes (other than income
taxes) and other governmental charges that may be imposed with respect to the issue or delivery of shares

imposed in connection with any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of shares of Coinmon Stock in
a name other than that in which the shares of Series Preferred so converted were registered.

q. No Dilution or Impairment. Without the appropriate vote of its
shareholders under the General Corporate Law of California or Section (2)(b) of this Article III, the
Company shall not amend its Restated Acticles of Incorporation or participate in any reorganization,
transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or take any other
voluntary action, for the purpose of avoiding or seeking to avoid the observance or performance of any of
the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Company, but shall at all times in good faith
assist in carrying out all such action as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate in order to protect all
of the rights of the holders of the Series Preferred, including the conversion rights of the holders of the
Series Preferred against dilution or other impairment.

5. No Reissuance of Series Preferred. No share or shares of Serics Preferred
acquired by the Company by reason of redemption, purchase, conversion or otherwise shall be reissued;

indemnification otherwise permitted by Section 317 of the Generai Corporation Law of California,
subject to the limits on such excess indemnification set forth in Section 204 of the General Corporation
Law of California. if, after the effective date of this Article, California law is amended in a manner
which permits a corporation to limit the monetary or other liability of its directors or to authorize
indemnification of, or advancement of such defense expenses to, its directors or other persons, in any
such case to a greater extent than is permitted on such effective date, the references in this Article to
“California law” shall to that extent be deemed to refer to California law as so amended.

C. Any repeal or modification of this Article shall only be prospective and shall not effect
the rights under this Article in effect at the time of the alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act
giving rise to liability.
