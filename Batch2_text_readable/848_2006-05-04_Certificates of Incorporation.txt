4, Conversion Rights.

The holders of Prefeared Stock shall have the following rights with respect
to the conversion of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock (the “Conversion Rights"):

(a) Optional Conversion. Subject to and in compliance with the
provisions of this Section 4, any shares of Preferred Stock may, at the option of the holder, be
converted at any time into fully-paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock. The number
of shares of Common Stock to which a holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled upon
conversion shall be the product obtained by multiplying the applicable “Preferred Stock

Conversion Rate” then in effect (determined as provided in Section 4(b)) by the number of

shares of Preferred Stock, as applicable, being converted.

(&b) =‘ Preferred Stock Conversion Rate. The conversion rate in effect
at any time for conversion of Preferred Stock (the “Preferred Stock Conversion Rate”) shall be
the quotient obtained by dividing the applicable Original Issue Price of the Preferred Stock by
the applicable “Preferred Stock Conversion Price,” calculated as provided in Section 4(c).

(c) ‘Preferred Stock Conversion Price. The conversion price fot -

each series of Preferred Stock shall initially be the applicable Original Issue Price of such series
of Preferred Stock (the “Preferred Stock Conversion Price”). Such initial Preferred Stock
Conversion Price shall be adjusted from time to time in accordance with this Section 4. All

571689 VSN 8.
references to Preferred Stock Conversion Price herein shall mean Preferred Stock Conversion
Price as so adjusted, for the applicable series.

(d) Mechanics of Conversion. Each holder of Preferred Stock who
desires to convert the same into shares of Common Stock pursuant to this Section 4 shall
surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Company or
any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice lo the Company at such

office that such holder elects to convert the same. Such notice shall state the number of shares of

Preferred Stock being conveited. Thereupon, the Company shall promptly issue and deliver at
such office to such holder a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock
to which such holder is entitled and shall promptly pay (i) in cash or, to the extent sufficient
funds are not then legally available therefor, in Common Stock (at the Common Stock’s fair
market value determined by the Board of Directors as of the date of such conversion), any
declared and unpaid dividends on the shares of Preferred Stock being converted and (ii) in cash

(at the Common Stock’s fair market value determined by the Board of Directors as of the date of

conversion) the value of any fiactional share of Common Stock otherwise issuable to any holder
of Preferred Stock. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made at the clase of business
on the date of such surrender of the certificates representing the shares of Preferred Stock to be
converted, and the person entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such
conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such shares of Common Stock
an such date.

; {e) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If the
Company shall at any time or from time to time after the date that the first share of Series C
Preferred is issued (the “Original Issue Date”) effect a subdivision of the outstanding Common
Stock without a corresponding subdivision of Preferred Stock, the applicable Preferred Stock
Conversion Price in effect immediately before that subdivision shall be proportionately
decreased. Conversely, if the Company shall at any time or from time to time after the Original
Issue Date combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares
without a corresponding combination of Preferred Stock, the applicable Preferred Stock
Conversion Price in effect immediately before the combination shall be proportionately
increased. Any adjustment under this Section 4(e) shall become effective at the close of business
on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective.

() Adjustment for Common Stock Dividends and Distributions.
If the Company at any time or fiom time to time after the Original Issue Date makes, or fixes a
record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or
other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock, in each such event the
applicable Prefeared Stock Conversion Price that is then in effect shall be decreased as of the
time of such issuance or, in the event such record date is fixed, as of the close of business on
such record date, by multiplying the applicable Preferred Stock Conversion Price then in effect
by a fraction (i) the numerator of which is the-total number of shares of Common Stock issued

and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of business on such

record date, and (ii) the denominator of which is the total number of shares of Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of business on
such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such

577689 vSIHN 9.
dividend or distribution; provided, however, that if such record date is fixed and such dividend is
not fully paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the applicable
Preferred Stock Conversion Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on
suoh record date and thereafter the applicable Preferred Stock Conversion Price shall be adjusted
pursuant to this Section 4(f) to reflect the actual payment of such dividend or distribution.

(g) Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. If
at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date, the Common Stock issuable upon
the conversion of Preferred Stock is changed into the same or a different number of shares of any
clase or classes of stock, whether by recapitalization, reclassification or otherwise (other than an
Acquisition or Asset Transfer as defined in Section 3(e) or a subdivision or combination of
‘shares or stock dividend or a reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale of assets provided for
elsewhere in this Section 4), in any such event each holder of Preferred Stock shall have the right
thereafter to convert such stock into the kind and amount of stock and other securities and
property receivable upon such recapitalization, reclassification or other change by holders of the
maximum number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Preferred Stock could
have been converted immediately priot to such recapitalization, reclassification or change, all
subject to further adjustment as provided herein or with respect to such other securities or
property by the terms thereof.

(h) = Reorganizations, Mergers or Consolidations. If at any time or
from time to time after the Original Issue Date, there is a capital reorganization of the Common
Stock or the merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another corporation or another
entity or person (other than an Acquisition or Asset Transfer as defined in Section 3(e) or a
recapitalization, subdivision, combination, reclassification, exchange or substitution of shares
provided for elsewhere in this Section 4), as a part of such capital reorganization, provision shall
be made so that the holders of Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon
conversion of Preferred Stock the number of shares of stock o1 other securities or property of the
Company to which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon
conversion would have been entitled on such capital reorganization, subject to adjustment in
1espect of such stock or securities by the teams thereof. In any such case, appropriate adjustment
shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 4 with respect to the rights of
the holders of Preferred Stock after the capital reorganization to the end that the provisions of
this Section 4 (including adjustment of the applicable Preferred Stock Conversion Price then in
effect and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of Preferred Stock) shall be applicable
after that event and be as nearly equivalent as practicable.

(i) Sale of Shares Below Preferred Stock Conversion Price.
@ If at any time or from time to time after the effective date

of this Certificate of Incorporation, the Company issues or sells, or is deemed by the express
provisions of this subsection (i) to have issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock (as

defined in subsection (i)(iv) below), other than as a dividend ot other distribution on any class of

stock as provided in Section 4(f), and other than a subdivision or combination of shares of
Comman Stock as provided in Section 4(e), for an Effective Price (as defined in subsection
(i)(iv) below) less than the then effective applicable Preferred Stock Conversion Price (a

ST1689 vS/HN 10
“Qualifying Dilutive Issuance”), then and in each such case the then existing applicable
Preferred Stock Conversion Price shall be reduced, as of the opening of business on the date of
such issue or sale, to a price determined by multiplying the applicable Preferred Stock
Conversion Price by a fraction (i) the numerator of which shall be (A) the number of shares of
Common Stock deemed outstanding (as defined below) immediately prior to such issue or sale,
plus (B) the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received (as

Company upon the exercise or conversion of 1ights, options or Convertible Securities is reduced

of conversion of such Convertible Secutities, and such Additional Shares of Common Stock, if
any, were issued or sold for the consideration actually received by the Company upon such

standard of conduct.
