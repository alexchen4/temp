substantially all of this corporation’s assets, (B) the consummation of the merger or
consolidation of this corporation with or into another entity (except a merger or consolidation in
which the holders of capital stock of this corporation immediately prior to such merger or
consolidation continue to hold at least 50% of the voting power of the capital stock of this
corporation or the surviving or acquiring entity immediately following such merger of
consolidation), (C) the closing of the transfer (whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise), in
one transaction or a series of related transactions, to a person or group of affiliated persons (other
than an underwriter of this corporation’s securities), of this corporation’s securities if, after such
closing, such person or group of affiliated persons would hold 50% or more of the outstanding
voting stock of this corporation (or the surviving or acquiring entity) or (D) a liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of this corporation; provided, however, that a transaction shall not
constitute a Liquidation Event if its sole purpose is to change the state of this corporation’s
incorporation or to create a holding company that will be owned in substantially the same
proportions by the persons who held this corporation’s securities immediately prior to such
transaction. Notwithstanding the prior sentence, the primary sale of shares of this corporation’s
capital stock in a financing transaction or in a series of transactions shall not be deemed a

6

111213 v7/BN
Liquidation Event. The treatment of any particular transaction or series of related transactions as
a Liquidation Event may be waived by the vote or written consent of (i) the holders of at least
fifty-nine percent (59%) of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single
class on an as-converted to Common Stock basis (the “Preferred Majority”) and (ii) the
Requisite Series D Holders.

(ii)

(A) In the event of a Liquidation Event referred to in
Subsection 2(f)(i)(A), if the corporation does not effect a dissolution of the corporation under the
General Corporation Law within 90 days after such Liquidation Event, then (1) the corporation
shall send a written notice to each holder of Preferred Stock no later than the 90™ day after the
Liquidation Event advising such holders of their right (and the requirements to be met to secure
such right) pursuant to the terms of the following clause (2) to require the redemption of such
shares of Preferred Stock, and (3) if the holders of the Preferred Majority or the Requisite Series
D Holders so request in a written instrument delivered to the corporation not later than 120 days
after such Liquidation Event, the corporation shall use the consideration received by the
corporation for such Liquidation Event (net of any retained liabilities associated with the assets
sold or technology licensed, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors), together
with any other assets of the corporation available for distribution to its stockholders, all to the
extent permitted by Delaware law governing distributions to stockholders (the “Available
Proceeds’), on the 150th day after such Liquidation Event, to redeem all outstanding shares of
(1) Series D Preferred Stock at a price per share equal to the Series D Liquidation Amount, (2)
Series C Preferred Stock at a price per share equal to the Series C Liquidation Amount, (3) the
Series B Preferred Stock at a price per share equal to the Series B Liquidation Amount, and (4)
the Series A/A-1 Preferred Stock at a price per share equal to the Series A/A-1 Liquidation
Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a redemption pursuant to the preceding
sentence, if the Available Proceeds are not sufficient to redeem all outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock, the corporation shall redeem a pro rata portion of each holder’s shares of
Preferred Stock based on the priorities and preferences set forth in Subsections 2(a)-(e) to the
fullest extent of such Available Proceeds, and shall redeem the remaining shares as soon as it
may lawfully do so under Delaware law governing distributions to stockholders. The provisions
of Section 3 shall apply, with such necessary changes in the details thereof as are necessitated by
the context, to the redemption of the Preferred Stock pursuant to this Subsection 2(f(ii)(A).
Prior to the distribution or redemption provided for in this Subsection 2(f)(ii)(A), the corporation
shall not expend or dissipate the consideration received for such Liquidation Event, except to
discharge expenses incurred in connection with such Liquidation Event or in the ordinary course
of business.

(iii) Allocation of Escrow and Contingent Consideration. In
the event of a Liquidation Event if any portion of the consideration payable to the stockholders
of the corporation is payable only upon satisfaction of contingencies (the “Additional
Consideration’’), the agreement or plan of merger or consolidation for such transaction shall
provide that (a) the portion of such consideration that is not Additional Consideration (such
portion, the “Initial Consideration’) shall be allocated among the holders of capital stock of the
Corporation in accordance with subsections 2(a)-(e) as if the Initial Consideration were the only
consideration payable in connection with such Liquidation Event and (b) any Additional

7

111213 v7/BN
Consideration which becomes payable to the stockholders of the Corporation upon satisfaction of
such contingencies shall be allocated among the holders of capital stock of the Corporation in
accordance with subsections 2(a)-(e) after taking into account the previous payment of the Initial
Consideration as part of the same transaction. For the purposes of this Subsection 2(f)(ili),
consideration placed into escrow or retained as holdback to be available for satisfaction of
indemnification or similar obligations in connection with such Liquidation Event shall be
deemed to be Additional Consideration.

(iv) In any Liquidation Event, if Proceeds received by this
corporation or its stockholders is other than cash or securities, its value will be deemed its fair
market value as determined by this corporation’s Board of Directors. Any securities shall be
valued as follows:

(A) | For securities not subject to investment letter or
other similar restrictions on free marketability:

(1) If traded on a securities exchange or a
similar national quotation system, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing
prices of the securities on such exchange or market over the twenty (20) trading-day period
ending three (3) trading days prior to the closing of the Liquidation Event;

(2) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value
shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) of
the securities over the twenty (20) trading-day period ending three (3) trading days prior to the
closing of the Liquidation Event; and

(3) If there is no active public market, the value
shall be the fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Board of Directors of this
corporation and the Preferred Majority.

(B) The method of valuation of securities subject to
investment letter or other similar restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising
solely by virtue of a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an
appropriate discount from the market value determined as above in (A) (1), (2) or (3) to reflect
the approximate fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Board of Directors of
this corporation and the Preferred Majority.

(C) The foregoing methods for valuing non-cash
consideration to be distributed in connection with a Liquidation Event shall, upon approval by
the stockholders of the definitive agreements governing a Liquidation Event, be superseded by
any determination of such value set forth in the definitive agreements governing such
Liquidation Event. .

(v) In the event the requirements of this Section 2 are not
complied with, this corporation shall forthwith either:

(A) cause the closing of such Liquidation Event to be
postponed until such time as the requirements of this Section 2 have been complied with; or

8

111213 v7/BN
(B) cancel such transaction, in which event the rights,
preferences and privileges of the holders of Preferred Stock shall revert to and be the same as
such rights, preferences and privileges existing immediately prior to the date of the first notice
referred to in subsection 2(f)(vi) hereof.

(vi) This corporation shall give each holder of record of
Preferred Stock written notice of such impending Liquidation Event not later than twenty (20)
days prior to the stockholders’ meeting called to approve such transaction, or twenty (20) days
prior to the closing of such transaction, whichever is earlier, and shall also notify such holders in
writing of the final approval of such transaction. The first of such notices shall describe the
material terms and conditions of the impending transaction and the provisions of this Section 2,
and this corporation shall thereafter give such holders prompt notice of any material changes
thereto. The transaction shall in no event take place sooner than twenty (20) days after this
corporation has given the first notice provided for herein or sooner than ten (10) days after this
corporation has given notice of any material changes provided for herein; provided, however,
that subject to compliance with the General Corporation Law such periods may be shortened or
waived upon the written consent of the Preferred Majority.

to the Series A/A-1 Preferred Stock, the Series B Redemption Price with respect to the Series B
Preferred Stock, the Series C Redemption Price with respect to the Series C Preferred Stock and
the Series D Redemption Price with respect to the Series D Preferred Stock. The number of
shares of Series A/A-1] Preferred Stock that this corporation shall be required to redeem on any
one Series A/A-1 Redemption Date shall be equal to the amount determined by dividing (1) the
aggregate number of shares of Series A/A-1 Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to
such Series A/A-1 Redemption Date by (ii) the number of remaining Series A/A-1 Redemption
Dates (including the Series A/A-1 Redemption Date to which such calculation applies). Any
redemption of a series of Series A/A-1 Preferred Stock effected pursuant to this subsection 3(d)
shall be made on a pro rata basis among the holders of Series A/A-1 Preferred Stock in
proportion to the aggregate Series A/A-1 Redemption Price of each such holder of Series A/A-1
Preferred Stock would otherwise be entitled to receive on the applicable Series A/A-1
Redemption Date.

10

111213 v7/BN
(e) Redemption Notice. At least fifteen (15) but no more than thirty
(30) days prior to each of the Series D Redemption Date, Series C Redemption Date, Series B
Redemption Date and Series A/A-1 Redemption Date (each such redemption date, a
“Redemption Date’), written notice shall be mailed, first class postage prepaid, to each holder of
record (at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is
given) of Preferred Stock, at the address last shown on the records of this corporation for such
holder, notifying such holder of the redemption to be effected on the applicable Redemption
Date, specifying the number of shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed from such holder, the
applicable Redemption Price and the place at which payment may be obtained and calling upon
such holder to surrender to this corporation, in the manner and at the place designated, his, her or
its certificate or certificates representing the shares to be redeemed, if any (the “Redemption
Notice”). Except as provided in subsection (3)(f), on or after each Redemption Date, each holder
of Preferred Stock on such Redemption Date shall surrender to this corporation the certificate or
certificates representing such shares, in the manner and at the place designated in the
Redemption Notice, and thereupon the applicable Redemption Price of such shares shall be
payable to the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the
owner thereof and each surrendered certificate shall be cancelled. In the event less than all the
shares represented by any such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued
representing the unredeemed shares.

(f) Termination of Rights; Insufficient Funds. From and after each
Redemption Date, unless there shall have been a default in payment of the applicable
Redemption Price, all rights of the holders of shares of Preferred Stock designated for
redemption on such Redemption Date in the Redemption Notice as holders of Preferred Stock
(except the right to receive the applicable Redemption Price without interest upon surrender of
their certificate or certificates) shall cease with respect to such shares, and such shares shall not
thereafter be transferred on the books of this corporation or be deemed to be outstanding for any
purpose whatsoever. Ifthe funds of this corporation legally available for redemption of shares of
Preferred Stock on a Redemption Date are insufficient to redeem the total number of shares of
Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such date, those funds that are legally available will be used
to redeem the maximum possible number of such shares ratably among the holders of such
shares to be redeemed in proportion to the aggregate applicable Redemption Price that each such
holder would be entitled to receive pursuant to subsections 3(a), 3(b), 3(c) or 3(d), as the case
may be. The shares of Preferred Stock not redeemed shall remain outstanding and entitled to all
the rights and preferences provided herein. At any time thereafter when additional funds of this
corporation are legally available for the redemption of shares of Preferred Stock, such funds will
immediately be used to redeem the balance of the shares that this corporation has become
obliged to redeem on any Redemption Date but that it has not redeemed.

4, Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion
rights as follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be
convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time and from time to time, and without
the payment of additional consideration by the holder thereof, at the office of this corporation or
any transfer agent for such stock, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Original Issue Price for such series by the

11

111213 v7/BN
Conversion Price (as defined below) for such series (the conversion rate for a series of Preferred
Stock into Common Stock is referred to herein as the “Conversion Rate” for such series),
determined as hereafter provided, in effect on the time of conversion. The “Conversion Price”
shall initially be $0.59708 per share for the Series D Preferred Stock, $0.74030 per share for the
Series C Preferred Stock, $0.73180 per share for the Series B Preferred Stock, $0.6280 per share
for the Series A-1 Preferred Stock and $0.38643 per share for the Series A Preferred Stock;
provided, however, that the Conversion Price for the Series D Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred
Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series A-1 Preferred Stock and Series A Preferred Stock, as the
case may be, shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in subsection 4(d).

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall
automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the applicable Conversion Rate at
the time in effect for each series of Preferred Stock immediately upon the earlier of (i) this
corporation’s sale of its Common Stock in a firm commitment underwritten public offering
pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
the public offering price of which was not less than three times the Original Issue Price per share
of the applicable series of Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends,
combinations, subdivisions, recapitalizations or the like) and which results in at least
$25,000,000 of net proceeds to this corporation (a “Qualified Public Offering’’) or (ii) the date
specified by written consent or agreement of the Preferred Majority and the Requisite Series D
Holders.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion.

(i) Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
voluntarily convert the same into shares of Common Stock pursuant to subsection 4(a), he or she
shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor (or, if such holder alleges that such
certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement reasonably
acceptable to this corporation to indemnify this corporation against any claim that may be made
against this corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate),
duly endorsed, at the office of this corporation or of any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock,
and shall give written notice to this corporation at its principal corporate office, of the election to
convert the same and shall state therein the name or names in which the certificate or certificates
for shares of Common Stock are to be issued. This corporation shall, as soon as practicable
thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or
nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock
to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid, together with any cash in lieu of a fraction of
a share. Such conversion shal! be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of
business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the
person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion
shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock
as of such date.

(ii) If the conversion is in connection with an underwritten
offering of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the

12

111213 v7/BN
conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering Preferred Stock for conversion, be
conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to such
offering, in which event the persons entitled to receive the Common Stock upon conversion of
the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until
immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities.

(iii) If the conversion is in connection with the automatic
conversion provisions of subsection 4(b) above, such conversion shall be deemed to have been
made on the date of closing of the transaction pursuant to subsection 4(b)(i) or the conversion
date described in the stockholder consent approving such conversion pursuant to subsection
A(b)(ii) (the “Automatic Conversion Time”), and the persons entitled to receive shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record
holders of such shares of Common Stock as of such date. All holders of record of shares of
Preferred Stock shall be sent written notice of the Automatic Conversion Time and the place
designated for automatic conversion of all such shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to subsection
4(b). Such notice need not be sent in advance of the occurrence of the Automatic Conversion
Time. Upon receipt of such notice, each holder of shares of Preferred Stock shall surrender his,
her or its certificate or certificates for all such shares (or, if such holder alleges that such
certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement reasonably
acceptable to this corporation to indemnify this corporation against any claim that may be made
against this corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate) to
this corporation at the place designated in such notice, and shall! thereafter receive certificates for
the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to subsection
4(b). At the Automatic Conversion Time, all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be
deemed to have been converted into shares of Common Stock, which shall be deemed to be
outstanding of record, and all rights with respect to the Preferred Stock so converted, including
the rights, if any, to receive notices and vote (other than as a holder of Common Stock), will
terminate, except only the rights of the holders thereof, upon surrender of their certificate or
certificates (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement) therefor, to receive a certificate or
certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable on such conversion in
accordance with the provisions hereof. If so required by this corporation, certificates
surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by written instrument or
instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to this corporation, duly executed by the registered
holder or by his, her or its attorney duly authorized in writing. As soon as practicable after the
Automatic Conversion Time and the surrender of the certificate or certificates (or lost certificate
affidavit and agreement) for the Preferred Stock, this corporation shall issue and deliver to such
holder, or to his, her or its nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of
Common Stock issuable on such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof.

(iv) All shares of Preferred Stock shall, from and after the
Automatic Conversion Time, no longer be deemed to be outstanding and, notwithstanding the
failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender the certificates for such shares on or prior to
such time, all rights with respect to such shares shall immediately cease and terminate at the
Automatic Conversion Time, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive shares of
Common Stock in exchange therefor and to receive payment of any dividends declared but
unpaid thereon.

111213 v7/BN
(d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock for Certain
Dilutive Issuances, Splits and Combinations.

(i) The applicable Conversion Price of the Series D Preferred
Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series A-1 Preferred Stock and
Series A Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

(A) _ If this corporation shall issue, after the date upon
which this Sixth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation is accepted for filing by the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the “Filing Date’), any Additional Stock (as defined
below) without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the applicable Conversion
Price of the Series D Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock, the
Series A Preferred Stock or the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, as the case may be, in effect
immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock, then such applicable Conversion
Price shall forthwith (except as otherwise provided in this clause (i)) be adjusted to a price
determined by multiplying the Conversion Price applicable to such series of Preferred Stock by a
fraction:

(1) the numerator of which shall be (X) the
number of shares of Common Stock Outstanding (as defined below) immediately prior to such
issuance plus (Y) the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration
received by this corporation for such issuance would purchase at such Conversion Price; and

(2) the denominator of which shal! be (X) the
number of shares of Common Stock Outstanding immediately prior to such issuance plus (Y) the
number of shares of such Additional Stock.

For purposes of this Section 4(d)(i)(A), the term “Common Stock Outstanding” shall mean and
include the following: (1) outstanding Common Stock, (2) Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of outstanding Preferred Stock, (3) Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
outstanding stock options and (4) Common Stock issuable upon exercise (and, in the case of
warrants to purchase Preferred Stock, conversion) of outstanding warrants. Shares described in
(1) through (4) above shall be included whether vested or unvested, whether contingent or
non-contingent and whether exercisable or not yet exercisable.

(B) No adjustment of the Conversion Price for the
Preferred Stock shall be made in an amount less than one cent per share, provided that any
adjustments that are not required to be made by reason of this sentence shall be carried forward
and shall be either taken into account in any subsequent adjustment made prior to three (3) years
from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward, or, if none, shall
be made at the end of such three (3) years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment
being carried forward. Except to the limited extent provided for in subsections 4(d)(i)(E)(3) and
4(d)(i)(E)(4) below, no adjustment of such Conversion Price pursuant to this subsection 4(d)(i)
shall have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price above the Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such adjustment.

111213 v7/BN
(C) In the case of the issuance of Additional Stock for
cash, the consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting
any reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by this
corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

(D) In the case of the issuance of the Additional Stock
for a consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be
deemed to be the fair market value thereof as determined by the Board of Directors irrespective
of any accounting treatment.

(E) In the case of the issuance of options to purchase or
rights to subscribe for Common Stock, securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable
for Common Stock or options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or
exchangeable securities, the following provisions shall apply for purposes of determining the
number of shares of Additional Stock issued and the consideration paid therefor:

(1) The aggregate maximum number of shares
of Common Stock deliverable upon exercise (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to
exercisability, including without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account
potential antidilution adjustments) of such options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common
Stock shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such options or rights were issued and for
a consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in
subsections 4(d)(i)(C) and 4(d)({i)(D)), if any, received by this corporation upon the issuance of
such options or rights plus the minimum exercise price provided in such options or rights
(without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) for the Common Stock covered
thereby.

(2) The aggregate maximum number of shares
of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of, or in exchange (assuming the satisfaction of
any conditions to convertibility or exchangeability, including, without limitation, the passage of
time, but without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) for, any such convertible
or exchangeable securities or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for
such convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof shall
be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or such options or rights
were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration, if any, received by this
corporation for any such securities and related options or rights (excluding any cash received on
account of accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the minimum additional consideration, if
any, to be received by this corporation (without taking into account potential antidilution
adjustments) upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or the exercise of any related
options or rights (the consideration in each case to be determined in the manner provided in

subsections 4(d)(1)(C) and 4(d)(i)(D)).

(3) In the event of any change in the number of
shares of Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to this corporation upon
exercise of such options or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such convertible or
exchangeable securities, the Conversion Price of the Series D Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred
Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series A/A-1 Preferred Stock, as applicable, to the extent in

15

111213 v7/BN
any way affected by or computed using such options, rights or securities, shall be recomputed to
reflect such change, but no further adjustment shall be made for the actual issuance of Common
Stock or any payment of such consideration upon the exercise of any such options or rights or
the conversion or exchange of such securities.

(4) Upon the expiration of any such options or
rights, the termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options
or rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Conversion Price of the
Series D Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series A/A-1
Preferred Stock, as applicable, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such
options, rights or securities or options or rights related to such securities, shall be recomputed to
reflect the issuance of only the number of shares of Common Stock (and convertible or
exchangeable securities that remain in effect) actually issued upon the exercise of such options or
rights, upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or upon the exercise of the options or
rights related to such securities.

(5) The number of shares of Additional Stock
deemed issued and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to subsections 4(d)(i)(E)(1)
and 4(d)(i)(E)(2) shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or expiration
of the type described in either subsection 4(d)(i)(E)(3) or 4(d)(i)(E)(1)¢4).

(6) If the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of such options or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such
convertible or exchangeable securities, or the consideration payable to this corporation upon
such exercise of such options or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such convertible
or exchangeable securities, cannot be calculated at all at the time such options or rights were
issued, any adjustment to the Conversion Price of the Series D Preferred Stock, Series C
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series A/A-1 Preferred Stock, as applicable, that
would result under the terms of this subsection 4(d)(i)(E) at the time of such issuance shall
instead be effected at the time such number of shares and/or amount of consideration is first
calculable (even if subject to subsequent adjustments), assuming for purposes of calculating such
adjustment to the Conversion Price of the Series D Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock,
Series B Preferred Stock and Series A/A-1 Preferred Stock, as applicable, that such issuance took
place at the time such calculation can first be made.

(ii) “Additional Stock” shall mean any shares of Common
Stock issued (or deemed to have been issued pursuant to subsection 4(d)({i)(E)) by this
corporation on or after the Filing Date other than shares of Common Stock issued (or deemed
issued pursuant to subsection 4(d)(i)(E)):

(A) as a dividend or distribution on all outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock;

(B) pursuant to a transaction described in subsection
4(d)(iii) hereof;

16

111213 v7/BN
(C) to employees, directors, consultants and other
service providers, or stock options to purchase such shares of Common Stock issued to
employees, directors, consultants and other service providers, for the primary purpose of
soliciting or retaining their services pursuant to a plan, agreement or agreement approved by this
corporation’s Board of Directors and reflected in the minutes of this corporation or approved in
the future by this corporation’s Board of Directors, including a majority of the Preferred
Directors;

(D) upon exercise of stock options or warrants to
purchase shares of Common Stock outstanding as of the Filing Date, in each case provided such
issuance is pursuant to the terms of such stock option or warrant;

(E) pursuant to a Qualified Public Offering;
(F) upon conversion of the Preferred Stock;

(G) upon conversion or exchange of securities
convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock and outstanding as of the Filing
Date, in each case provided such issuance is pursuant to the terms of such securities;

(H) as. a result of a decrease in the Conversion Price of
any series of Preferred Stock resulting from the operation of Section 4(d);

(I) pursuant to the Series D Preferred Purchase
Agreement, dated on or about the date hereof, as amended from time to time, between this
corporation and the other parties thereto; or

(J) pursuant to equipment leasing or other debt
financing transactions, or warrants to purchase such shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock
pursuant to equipment leasing or other debt financing transactions, approved unanimously by
this corporation’s Board of Directors.

(iii) In the event this corporation should at any time or from
time to time after the Filing Date fix a record date for the effectuation of a split or subdivision of
the outstanding shares of Common Stock or the determination of holders of Common Stock
entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock
or other securities or rights convertible into, or entitling the holder thereof to receive directly or
indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock (hereinafter referred to as “Common Stock
Equivalents”) without payment of any consideration by such holder for the additional shares of
Common Stock or the Common Stock Equivalents (including the additional shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof), then, as of such record date (or the date of
such dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no record date is fixed), the Conversion Price of
each series of Preferred Stock shall be appropriately decreased so that the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series of Preferred Stock shall be
increased in proportion to such increase of the aggregate of shares of Common Stock outstanding
and those issuable with respect to such Common Stock Equivalents with the number of shares
issuable with respect to Common Stock Equivalents determined from time to time in the manner
provided for deemed issuances in subsection 4(d)(i)(E).

17

111213 v7/BN
(iv) If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at
any time after the Filing Date is decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock, then, following the record date of such combination, the Conversion Price for
each series of Preferred Stock shall be appropriately increased so that the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be decreased in
proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares.

(v) In the event this corporation shall issue on more than one
date Additional Stock that are a part of one transaction or a series of related transactions and that
would result in an adjustment to the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock pursuant
to the terms of subsection 4(d), then, upon the final such issuance, the applicable Conversion
Price shall be readjusted to give effect to all such issuances as if they occurred on the date of the
first such issuance (and without giving effect to any additional adjustments as a result of any
such subsequent issuances within such period).

(e) Other Distributions. In the event this corporation shall declare a
distribution payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by this
corporation or other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred
to in subsection 4(d){iii), then, in each such case for the purpose of this subsection 4(e), the
holders of the Series D Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock
and the Series A/A-1 Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any such
distribution as though they were the holders of the number of shares of Common Stock of this
corporation into which their shares of Series D Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock,
Series B Preferred Stock and Series A/A-1 Preferred Stock, as applicable, are convertible as of
the record date fixed for the determination of the holders of Common Stock of this corporation
entitled to receive such distribution.

(f) Recapitalizations and Mergers. Subject to the provisions of
Section 2, if at any time or from time to time there shall be a reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, consolidation or merger of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision,
combination or merger or sale of assets transaction provided for elsewhere in this Section 4 or in
Section 2) provision shall be made so that the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock, Series C
Preferred Stock, the SeriesB Preferred Stock and the Series A/A-1 Preferred Stock shall
thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of the Series D Preferred Stock, Series C
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series A/A-1 Preferred Stock the number of shares
of stock or other securities or property of this corporation or otherwise, to which a holder of
Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of such series of Preferred Stock would have been
entitled on such recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the
application of the provisions of this Section 4 with respect to the rights of the holders of the
Series D Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock and the
Series A/A-1 Preferred Stock after the recapitalization to the end that the provisions of this
Section 4 (including adjustment of the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock then in
effect and the number of shares purchasable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be
applicable after that event as nearly equivalently as may be practicable.

(g) No Fractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments.

18

111213 v7/BN
(i) No fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of
any share or shares of the Series D Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred
Stock or Series A/A-1 Preferred Stock and the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock to
be issued to particular stockholders, shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share and this
corporation shall pay in cash the fair market value of any fractional shares as of the time when
entitlement to receive such fractions is determined. Whether or not fractional shares would be
issuable upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of
Series D Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series A/A-1
Preferred Stock the holder is at the time converting into Common Stock and the number of
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion.

(ii) | Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of
the Conversion Price of Series D Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred
Stock or Series A/A-1 Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4, this corporation, at its expense,
shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and
prepare and furnish to each holder of Series D Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock,
Series B Preferred Stock and Series A/A-1 Preferred Stock, as applicable, a certificate setting
forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such
adjustment or readjustment is based. This corporation shall, upon the written request at any time
of any holder of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate
setting forth (A) such adjustment and readjustment, (B) the Conversion Price for the Series D
Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series A/A-1 Preferred
Stock, as applicable, at the time in effect, and (C) the number of shares of Common Stock and
the amount, if any, of other property that at the time would be received upon the conversion of a
share of Series D Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or
Series A/A-1 Preferred Stock.

(h) Notices of Record Date. In the event of any taking by this
corporation of a record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the
holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend) or other
distribution, this corporation shall mail to each holder of Preferred Stock, at least ten (10) days
prior to the date specified therein, a notice specifying the date on which any such record is to be
taken for the purpose of such dividend or distribution, and the amount and character of such
dividend or distribution.

(i) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. — This
corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares
of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Series
D Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series A/A-1 Preferred
Stock, such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to
effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of the Series D Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred
Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series A/A-1 Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number
of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all then-outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, in addition to such other
remedies as shall be available to the holder of such Preferred Stock, this corporation will take
such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient

19

111213 v7/BN
for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite
stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to this Sixth Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation.

Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Section 4 to
be given to the holders of shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed given if deposited in the
United States mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to each holder of record at his address
appearing on the books of this corporation.

(k) Waiver of Adjustment to Conversion Price. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, (i) any downward adjustment of the Conversion Price of the
Series D Preferred Stock may be waived, either prospectively or retroactively in a particular
instance, by the consent or vote of the Requisite Series D Holders; any such waiver shall bind all
holders of shares of the Series D Preferred Stock; (ii) any downward adjustment of the
Conversion Price of the Series C Preferred Stock may be waived, either prospectively or
retroactively in a particular instance, by the consent or vote of the Requisite Series C Holders;
any such waiver shall bind all holders of shares of the Series C Preferred Stock, (iii) any
downward adjustment of the Conversion Price of the Series B Preferred Stock may be waived,
either prospectively or retroactively in a particular instance, by the consent or vote of the
Requisite Series B Holders; any such waiver shall bind all holders of shares of the Series B
Preferred Stock, (iv) any downward adjustment of the Conversion Price of the Series A-1
Preferred Stock may be waived, either prospectively or retroactively in a particular instance, by
the consent or vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series A-1
Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class; any such waiver shall bind all holders of shares of
the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, and (v) any downward adjustment of the Conversion Price of the
Series A Preferred Stock may be waived, either prospectively or retroactively in a particular
instance, by the consent or vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the
Series A Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class; any such waiver shall bind all holders of
shares of the Series A Preferred Stock.

(I) Taxes. This corporation shall pay any and all issue and other
similar taxes that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of Common
Stock upon conversion of shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to subsection 4(c). This
corporation shall not, however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of
any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other
than that in which the shares of Preferred Stock so converted were registered, and no such
issuance or delivery shall be made unless and until the person or entity requesting such issuance
has paid to this corporation the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of
this corporation, that such tax has been paid.

(m) Termination of Conversion Rights. In the event of a notice of
redemption of any shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 3, the Conversion Rights of the
shares designated for redemption shall terminate at the close of business on the last full day
preceding the applicable Redemption Date, unless the redemption price is not fully paid on such
Redemption Date, in which case the Conversion Rights for such shares shall continue until] such

5. Voting Rights.

(a) General Voting Rights. On any matter presented to the
stockholders of this corporation for their action or consideration at any meeting of stockholders
of this corporation (or by written consent of stockholders in lieu of meeting), the holder of each
share of Preferred Stock shall have the right to one vote for each share of Common Stock into
which such Preferred Stock could be converted as of the record date for determining
stockholders entitled to vote on such matter, and with respect to such vote, such holder shall have
full voting rights and powers equal to the voting rights and powers of the holders of Common
Stock, and shall be entitled to notice of any stockholders’ meeting in accordance with the Bylaws
of this corporation. Except as provided by law or by the other provisions of this Sixth Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, holders of Preferred Stock shall vote together with the
holders of Common Stock as a single class. Fractional votes shall not, however, be permitted
and any fractional voting rights available on an as-converted basis (after aggregating all shares
into which shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder could be converted) shall be rounded to
the nearest whole number (with one-half being rounded upward).

(b) Voting for the Election of Directors. As long as any shares of
Series D Preferred Stock are outstanding, the holders of such shares of Series D Preferred Stock,
exclusively and as a separate class, shall be entitled to elect two (2) directors of this corporation
at any election of directors (each a “Series D Director”). As long as any shares of Series C
Preferred Stock are outstanding, the holders of such shares of Series C Preferred Stock,
exclusively and as a separate class, shall be entitled to elect one (1) director of this corporation at
any election of directors (the “Series C Director’). As long as any shares of Series B Preferred
Stock are outstanding, the holders of such shares of Series B Preferred Stock, exclusively and as
a separate class, shall be entitled to elect one (1) director of this corporation at any election of
directors (the “Series B Director”). As long as any shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock are
outstanding, the holders of such shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, exclusively and as a
separate class, shall be entitled to elect two (2) directors of this corporation at any election of
directors (each a “Series A-1 Director’). As long as any shares of Series A Preferred Stock are
outstanding, the holders of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock, exclusively and as a separate
class, shall be entitled to elect one (1) director of this corporation at any election of directors (the
“Series A Director,’ and together with the Series D Directors, Series C Directors, Series B
Directors and Series A-1 Directors, the “Preferred Directors”). The holders of Common Stock,
exclusively and as a separate class, shall be entitled to elect one (1) director of this corporation at
any election of directors. The holders of Preferred Stock and Common Stock (voting together as
a single class and not as separate series, and on an as-converted basis) shall be entitled to elect
any remaining directors of this corporation.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 223(a)(1) and 223(a)(2) of the General
Corporation Law, any vacancy, including newly created directorships resulting from any
increase in the authorized number of directors or amendment of this Sixth Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation, and vacancies created by removal or resignation of a
director, may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, though less than a quorum, or

21

111213 v7/BN
by a sole remaining director, and the directors so chosen shall hold office until the next annual
election and until their successors are duly elected and shall qualify, unless sooner displaced;
provided, however, that where such vacancy occurs among the directors elected by the holders of
a class or series of stock, the holders of shares of such class or series may override the Board of
Directors’ action to fill such vacancy by voting for their own designee to fill such vacancy (i) at a
meeting of this corporation’s stockholders or (ii) by written consent. Any director may be
removed during his or her term of office, either with or without cause, by, and only by, the
affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of the class or series of stock entitled to elect such
director or directors, given either at a special meeting of such stockholders duly called for that
purpose or pursuant to a written consent of stockholders, and any vacancy thereby created may
be filled by the holders of that class or series of stock represented at the meeting or pursuant to
written consent.

breach of duty to this corporation, its stockholders, and others.
