shall automatically be converted into fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Steck of
the Corporation (i) upon approval by vote or written consent of the holders of sixty percent
(60%) or moore of the total number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding, or (ii)
immediately upon the closing of the sale of the Corporation’s Common Stock in a firm
commitment, underwritten public offering registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (‘‘Secunties Act”), covering the offer and sale of Common Stock for the account of the
Company in which (A) the per share price (before deduction of underwriting commissions and
expenses) is determined from a valuation of the Corporation, immediately prior to the offering,
of at least fifty million dollars ($50,000,000) and (B) the gross proceeds to the Corporation
(bcforce deduction of underwriting commissions and expenses) are at least twenty million dollars
($20,000,000) (the “Initial Qualified Public Offering’).

(b) Conversion Price. The number of shares of Common Stock into which cach share
of the Series A Preferred Stock may be converted shall be determined by dividing the Original
Purchase Price, plus accrued and unpaid dividends, by the Conversion Price (determined as
hereinafter provided) in effect at the time of the conversion. The price at which shares of
Common Stock shal] be deliverable upon conversion of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock
shall initially be the Original Purchase Price per sharc of Common Stock. Such initia]
“Conversion Price” shall be adjusted as hereinafter provided.

(c) Procedure for Conversion. The holder of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock
may exercise the conversion rights as to such shares or any part thereof by delivering to the
Corporation during regular business hours, at the Corporation's principal office or at the office of
any transfer agent of the Corporation for the Series A Preferred Stock, or at such other place as
may be designated by the Corporation, the certificate or certificates for the shares to be
converted, duly endorsed for transfer to the Corporation (if required by it), accompanied by
written notice stating that the holder elects to convert such shares, Conversion shall be deemed
to have been effected on the date when such delivery is made, or the conditions for automatic
conversion set forth in subsection 4(a) above have been satisfied, and such date is referred to
herein as the “Conversion Date.” As promptly as practicable thereafter the Corporation shall
issue and deliver to or upon the written order of such holder, at such office or other place
designated by the Corporation, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled and a check for cash with respect to any
fractional interest in a share of Common Stock as provided in subsection 4(d) below. The holder

unless the transfer books of the Corporation are closed on that date, in which event the holder
shall be deemed to have become a stockholder of record on the next succeeding date on which
the transfer books are open, but the Conversion Price shall be that in effect on the Conversion
Date. Upon conversion of only a portion of the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock
represented by a certificate surrendered for conversion, the Corporation shall issue and deliver to

Stock representing the unconverted portion of the certificate so surrendered.

(d) No Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued
upon conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock. If more than one share of Series A
Preferred Stock shall be surrendered for conversion at any one time by the same holder, the
number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on
the basis of the aggregate number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock so surrendered. Instead
of any fractional shares of Common Stock which would otherwise be issuable upon conversion
of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall pay a cash adjustment in respect
of such fractional interest equal to the fair market value of such fractional interest as determined
in good faith by the Corporation’s Board of Directors.

(e) Common Stock Reserve. The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep
available, out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting
the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, the full number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon the conversion of all Series A Preferred Stock from time to time outstanding. The
Corporation shall from time to time (subject to obtaining necessary director and stockholder
action), in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, increase the authorized amount of
its Common Stock if at any time the authorized number of shares of its Common Stock
remaining unissued shal] not be sufficient to permit the conversion of all of the shares of
Senes A Preferred Stock at the time outstanding.

(f) Status of Converted Stock. All certificates of Series A Preferred Stock
surrendered for conversion shall be appropriately canceled on the books of the Corporation, and
the shares so converted shall be restored to the status of authorized but unissued Preferred Stock
of the Corporation, undesignated as to series.

(g) Notice of Certain Events. In case:

(i) the Corporation shall take a record of the holders of its Common Stock for
the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend, or any other distribution, payable otherwise
than in cash; or

(ii) the Corporation shall take a record of the holders of its Common Stock for
the purpose of entitling them to subscribe for or purchase any shares of stock of any class or to
receive any other rights; or

(iii) of any capital reorganization of the Corporation, reclassification of the
capital stock of the Corporation (other than a subdivision or combination of its outstanding
shares of Common Stock), or a consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into another
corporation or conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation to another

subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

subdivide the outstanding shares of Common Stock, or shall issue a stock dividend on its
outstanding Common Stock, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision
or the issuance of such dividend shall be proportionately decreased, and in case the Corporation
shall at any time combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price in
effect immediately prior to such combination shall be proportionately increased, effective at the
close of business on the date of such subdivision, dividend or combination, as the case may be.

(b) Reorganization, Etc. In case of any capital reorganization (other than a
subdivision or combination of outstanding shares or a transaction deemed to be a liquidation,
dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation pursuant to Section 2(b) above) or any

which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation deliverable upon
conversion of such Series A Preferred Stock would have been entitled upon such reorganization
or reclassification; and, in any such case, appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors) shall be made in the application of the provisions herein set forth with
respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the halders of the Series A Preferred Stock, to the
end that the provisions set forth herein (including provisions with respect to changes in and other
adjustments of the Conversion Price) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may

of the Series A Preferred Stock.

rights or the granting of such options, as the case may be) for the issuance of such shares.

(D) Incase of the issuance or issuances by the Corporation in any
manner of any obligations or of any shares of stock of the Corporation that shall be convertible
into or exchangeable for Common Stock, all shares of Common Stock issuable upon the

Corporation for such additional shares of Common Stock shall be deemed to be the total of
(X) the amount of consideration received by the Corporation upon the issuance of such

ten (10) days following delivery of such notice to object to the matters set forth therein. If the
Corporation so objects, such holders and the Corporation will have thirty (30) days to negotiate in
good faith to resolve the dispute and/or for the Corporation to cure the breach; provided, however,
that if such holders and the Corporation are unable to resolve the dispute or the Corporation is
unable to cure the breach to the reasonable satisfaction of the holders of at least two-thirds of the
shares of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding, then either the holders of at least two-thirds of
the shares of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding, on the one hand, or the Corporation’s Board
of Directors, on the other hand, may request that the American Arbitration Association select an
arbitrator, and such arbitrator shall determine whether a material default, non-fulfillment or breach in
any of the representations, warranties or covenants of the Corporation set forth in the Series A
Purchase Agreement or Ancillary Agreements has occurred, which determination shall be binding
upon the Corporation and the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock. The Corporation shall, on
cach Redemption Date, redeem up to the maximum amount the Corporation may lawfully redeem
out of funds legally available therefor. The “Redemption Price” shal] mean an amount per share
equal to the Series A Original Issue Price plus an additional amount equal to any dividends accrued
or declared but unpaid on each such share.

(B) Redemption Procedure. Subject to subsection (A) of this Section 4.4, within
fifteen (15) days of the receipt by the Corporation of the Redemption Request, the Corporation shall
mail, first class postage prepaid, written notice (the “Notice of Redemption”) to each holder of
record (at the close of business on the business day preceding the day on which notice is given) of
Series A Preferred Stock, at the address last shown on the records of the Corporation for such holder,
for the purpose of notifying such holder of the redemption to be effected. The Notice of Redemption
shall specify the Redemption Date which shall be between fifteen (15) and thirty (30) days after the
mailing of the Notice of Redemption on which the Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding shall
be redeemed and the place at which payment shall be made, which shal! be the principal! offices of
the Corporation or such other place as shall be mutually agreeable to the Corporation and holders of
at least two-thirds of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding. The Notice of

PALIB2_3130821_3 (2) -|1-
Redemption shall call upon each holder of Series A Preferred Stock to either (i) surrender to the
Corporation, in the manner and at the place designatcd, such holder’s certificate or certificates
Tepresenting the shares to be redeemed or (ii) convert such Series A Preferred Stack into Common
Stock prior to the Redemption Date in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.3 above. Subject
tu Section 4.4(C), on the Redemption Date, the Corporation shal] pay the Redemption Price in cash
or by check to the order of the person whose name appears on the certificate or certificates of the
Series A Preferred Stock that (i) shall not have been converted pursuant to Section 4.3 hereof and
(ii) shall have been surrendered to the Corporation in the manner and at the place designated in the
Notice of Redemption and thereupon each surrendered certificate shall be canceled.

(C) Effect of Redemption. From and after each Redemption Date, unless there
shall have been a default in payment of the Redemption Price, al! rights of the holders of the shares
of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed on a Redemption Date (except the right to reccive their
respective Redemption Price without interest upon surrender of their certificate or certificates) shall
cease with respect to such shares, and such shares shall not thereafter be transferred on the books of
the Corporation or be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose whatsoever. If the funds of the
Corporation legally available for redemption on any Redemption Date are insufficient to redeem the
total number of shares requested to be redeemed on such date, those funds which are legally
available will be used to redeem the maximum possible number of such shares ratably among the
holders of such shares to be redeemed based upon their holdings of Preferred Stock. The shares not
redeemed shal] remain outstanding and be entided to all the rights and preferences provided herein.
At any time thereafter when additional funds of the Corporation are legally available for the
redemption of shares not redeemed, such funds will immediately be set aside for the redemption of
the balance of the shares which the Corporation has become obligated to redeem on any Redemption
Date but which it has not redeemed.

(D) Redemption Funding. On or prior to each Redemption Date, the Corporation
shall deposit the Redemption Price of all shares of Series A Preferred Stock designated for
redemption in the Redemption Notice, and not yet redeemed or converted, with a bank or trust
company having aggregate capital and surplus in excess of $100,000,000 as a trust fund for the
benefit of the respective holders of the shares designated for redemption and not yet redeemed.
Simultaneously, the Corporation shal] deposit irrevocable instructions and authority to such bank or
trust company to pay, on and after the date fixed for redemption or prior thereto, the Redemption
Price of the Series A Preferred Stock to the holders thereof, upon receipt of notification from the
Corporation that such holder has surrendered such holder’s certificates pursuant to subsection (B)
above. Any money deposited by the Corporation pursuant to this subsection (D) for the redemption
of shares which are thereafter converted into shares of Common Stock no later than the close of
business on the Jast business day prior to the Redemption Date shall be returned to the Corporation
forthwith upon such conversion. The balance of any money deposited by the Corporation pursuant
to this subsection (D) remaining unclaimed at the expiration of six months following the Redemption
Date shall thereafter be returned to the Corporation, provided that the stockholder to which such
money would be payable hereunder shal} be entitled, upon proof of its ownership of the Series A
Preferred Stock, to receive such monies but without interest from the Redemption Date.
