subsequent stock splits, stock dividends, combinations of shares, recapitalizations, or other
similar event), or (B) the amount per share to which such holder would be entitled if the
remaining assets of the Corporation legally available for distribution by the Corporation (i.e.,

A Preferred Stock and Common Stock in proportion to the number of shares of Common Stock
held by them, with the shares of Series A Preferred Stock being treated for this purpose as if they

the Corporation shall be distributed pro rata among the holders of the Common Stock in
proportion to the number of shares of Common Stock held by them.

(c) Events Deemed a Liquidation. For purposes of this Section
2, a Liquidation of the Corporation shall be deemed to be occasioned by, or to include, (i) the

transactions (including, without limitation, any reorganization, merger or consolidation) that
results in the transfer of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding voting power of the
Corporation; or (ii) a sale, license or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Corporation (an “Acquisition’), unless the holders of sixty-five percent (65%) of the outstanding

Articles_of_Amendment_and_ Restatement--2011_Offering

Acquisition shall be the cash or the value of the property, rights and/or securities distributed to
such holders by the acquiring person, firm or other entity.

(i) In any of such events, if the consideration received by
this corporation is other than cash, its value will be deemed its fair market value as determined in
good faith by the Board of Directors; provided, that such majority must include at least two (2)
of the directors designated by SAM, BASF and Arancia pursuant to Section 5(b). Any securities
shall be valued as follows:

(A) Securities not subject to investment letter or
other similar restrictions on free marketability covered by (B) below:

(1) If traded on a securities exchange or
through The Nasdaq National Market, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing
prices of the securities on such exchange over the thirty (30) day period ending three (3) days
prior to the closing;

(2) If actively traded over-the-counter, the
value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is
applicable) over the five (5) business day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing; and

(3) If there is no active public market, the
value shall be the fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by this corporation and the
holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock and the Series C Preferred Stock, voting as a single
class on an as-converted to Common Stock basis (at the then applicable Conversion Ratio).

(B) The method of valuation of securities subject
to investment letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising
solely by virtue of a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an
appropriate discount from the market value determined as above in (A) (1), (2) or (3) to reflect
the approximate fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by this corporation and the
holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock, voting together as a
single class on an as-converted to Common Stock basis (at the then applicable Conversion
Ratio).

(ii) In the event the requirements of this Section 2(c)
are not complied with in connection with an Acquisition, the corporation shall promptly either:

(A) cause such closing to be postponed until
such time as the requirements of this Section 2 have been complied with; or

(B) cancel such transaction, in which event the
rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of Preferred Stock shall revert to and be the
same as such rights, preferences and privileges existing.

10

Articles_of_Amendment_and_Restatement--2011_Offering

to issue a Common Stock certificate until the Preferred Stock certificate is surrendered. The
Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such
holder of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock, as the
case may be, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the
number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid. Such
conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the
date of such surrender of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or
Series C Preferred Stock, to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares
of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record
holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock as of such date. If the conversion is in
connection with an underwritten offering of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act,
or in an Acquisition, the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering Series A
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock for conversion, be
conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to such
offering or the closing of the Acquisition, in which event the person(s) entitled to receive the
Common Stock upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or
Series C Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Series A Preferred Stock,
Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of
such sale of securities or Acquisition.

Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock, respectively, in
effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock (except as set forth in Section
4(d)(iv) below), the Conversion Price for each such series in effect immediately prior to each
such issuance shall forthwith be adjusted to equal the total amount of consideration received by
the Corporation per share of Additional Stock so issued, or, if such Additional Stock was issued

a consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in Section

minimum exercise price provided in such options or rights (without taking into account potential
antidilution adjustments) for the Common Stock covered thereby.

Articles_of_Amendment_and_Restatement--2011_Offering
6/7/2007

(B) The aggregate maximum number of shares
of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of, or in exchange (assuming the satisfaction of
any conditions to convertibility or exchangeability, including, without limitation, the passage of
time, but without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) for, any such convertible
or exchangeable securities or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for
such convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof shall
be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or such options or rights
were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration, if any, received by the
Corporation for any such securities and related options or rights (excluding any cash received on
account of accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the minimum additional consideration, if
any, to be received by the Corporation (without taking into account potential antidilution
adjustments) upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or the exercise of any related

shares of Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon
exercise of such options or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such convertible or
exchangeable securities, including, but not limited to, a change resulting from the antidilution
provisions thereof (unless such options or rights or convertible or exchangeable securities were
merely deemed to be included in the numerator and denominator for purposes of determining the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding for purposes of Section 4(d)(ii)), the Conversion
Prices, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, rights or securities,
shall be recomputed to reflect such change, but no further adjustment shall be made for the actual
issuance of Common Stock or any payment of such consideration upon the exercise of any such
options or rights or the conversion or exchange of such securities.

(D) Upon the expiration of any such options or
rights, the termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options
or rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Conversion Prices of the
Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock, to the extent in
any way affected by or computed using such options, rights or securities or options or rights
related to such securities (unless such options or rights were merely deemed to be included in the
numerator and denominator for purposes of determining the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding for purposes of Section 4(d)(ii)), shall be recomputed to reflect the issuance of only
the number of shares of Common Stock (and convertible or exchangeable securities that remain
in effect) actually issued upon the exercise of such options or rights, upon the conversion or
exchange of such securities or upon the exercise of the options or rights related to such
securities.

(E) The number of shares of Common Stock
deemed issued and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to Sections 4(d)(iii)(A) and

type described in either Sections 4(d)(iii)(C) or 4(d)(iii)(D).

(iv) Adjustment_for Subdivision of Common Stock,

Common Stock Dividend, Issuance of Common Stock Equivalents. In the event the Corporation
should at any time or from time to time after the Filing Date, fix a record date for the effectuation

of a split or subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or the determination of
holders of Common Stock entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in
additional shares of Common Stock or other securities or rights convertible into, or entitling the
holder thereof to receive directly or indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock (hereinafter
referred to as “Common Stock Equivalents”) without payment of any consideration by such
holder for the additional shares of Common Stock or the Common Stock Equivalents (including
the additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof), then, as of
such record date (or the date of such dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no record date
is fixed), the Conversion Prices of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or
Series C Preferred Stock shall be appropriately decreased so that the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be increased in
proportion to such increase of the aggregate of shares of Common Stock outstanding and those
issuable with respect to such Common Stock Equivalents with the number of shares issuable
with respect to Common Stock Equivalents determined from time to time in the manner provided
for deemed issuances in Section 4(d)(iii).

(v) Adjustment for Combinations of Common Stock. If
the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any time after the Purchase Date is

decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, then, following the
record date of such combination, the Conversion Prices for the Series A Preferred Stock, Series
B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock shall be appropriately increased so that the number
of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be
decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares,

(vi) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of
this Section 4(d), the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue (or deemed issue) of
any Additional Shares of Common Stock shall be computed as follows:

(A) Cash Consideration. In the case of the
issuance of Common Stock for cash, the consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash
paid therefor before deducting any reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses
allowed, paid or incurred by the Corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection
with the issuance and sale thereof.

(B) Non-Cash Consideration. In the case of the
issuance of the Common Stock for a consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the
consideration other than cash shall be deemed to be the fair value thereof at the time of issuance
as determined by the Board of Directors irrespective of any accounting treatment; provided, that
such majority must include at least two (2) of the directors designated by SAM, BASF and
Arancia pursuant to Section 5(b).

(e) Adjustment for Stock Dividend and Other Distributions, In
the event the Corporation shall declare a distribution payable in securities of other persons,

evidences of indebtedness issued by the Corporation or other persons, assets (excluding cash
14

Atticles_of_Amendment_and_Restatement--2011_ Offering
6/7/2007

dividends) or options or rights not referred to in Section 4(d)(iv), then, in each such case for the
purpose of this Section 4(e), the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, the holders of the Series
B Preferred Stock and the holders of Series C Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a proportionate
share of any such distribution as though they were the holders of the number of shares of
Common Stock of the Corporation into which their shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock are convertible as of the record date fixed for the
determination of the holders of Common Stock of the Corporation entitled to receive such
distribution.

(f) Adjustment for Recapitalizations. If at any time or from
time to time there shall be a recapitalization of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision,

combination or merger or sale of assets transaction provided for elsewhere in this Section 4 or in
Section 2) provision shall be made so that the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, the holders of
Series B Preferred Stock and the holders of Series C preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled
to receive upon conversion of any of their shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred
Stock and Series C Preferred Stock the number of shares of stock or other securities or property
of the Corporation or otherwise, to which a holder of Common Stock deliverable upon
conversion would have been entitled on such recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate
adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 4 with respect to the
rights of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred
Stock after the recapitalization to the end that the provisions of this Section 4 (including
adjustment of the Conversion Price then in effect and the number of shares purchasable upon
conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred
Stock) shall be applicable after that event as nearly equivalent as may be possible.

(g) NoImpairment. The Corporation will not, by amendment of
its Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or through any reorganization, recapitalization, transfer
of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary
action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed
or performed hereunder by the Corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in the
carrying out of all the provisions of this Section 4 and in the taking of all such action as may be
necessary or appropriate in order to protect the Conversion Rights of the holders of Series A
Preferred Stock, the holders of Series B Preferred Stock and the holders of Series C Preferred
Stock against impairment.

(h)  Pay-to-Play Provision.

(i) If after the Filing Date (A) the Corporation issues
Additional Stock, other than as a dividend or other distribution on any class of stock as provided
in this Section 4 and other than as a subdivision or combination of shares of Common Stock as
provided in this Section 4, without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the
Conversion Prices for the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, respectively, in
effect immediately prior to such issuance (such issuance being referred to herein as a “Dilutive
Issuance”) and (B) any holder of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock has the
right, pursuant to Section 2.3 of the Third Amended and Restated Investors’ Rights Agreement
dated as of December 17, 2004, by and among the Corporation and the equityholders named
therein (the “Investors’ Rights Agreement”), to purchase a pro rata share (calculated pursuant

15

Articles_of_Amendment_and_Restatement--2011_Offering
6/7/2007

to Section 2.3 of the Investors’ Rights Agreement) of such Dilutive Issuance (without giving
effect to any rights to purchase the shares of other equity holders who do not subscribe for their
full pro rata shares) and such holder does not exercise such right (such holder being referred to
herein as a “Non-Participating Holder’), then:

(A) no later than 10 days following the closing
of such Dilutive Issuance, the Corporation shall designate, by the filing of articles supplementary
pursuant to Section 2-208 of the Maryland General Corporation Law, or, if there are not a
sufficient number of shares of undesignated Preferred Stock, by the filing of articles of
amendment, additional series of Preferred Stock, to be called “Series A-1 Preferred Stock” and
“Series B-1 Preferred Stock”, which shall consist of such number of shares as is equal to the
number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock being converted
pursuant to the terms of this Section 4(h) and shall have rights, preferences and privileges
identical to those of the Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, as the case may be,
and shall be considered Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock for all purposes
hereunder (including voting together as a single series), except that (1) Sections 4(d)(i), 4(d)(ii),
and 4(d)(iii) and this Section 4(h) shall be omitted from the terms of such new Series A-1
Preferred Stock and Series B-1 Preferred Stock; (2) the liquidation preferences for the Series A
Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock set forth in Section 2(a) shall be omitted from
the terms of such new Series A-1 Preferred Stock and Series B-1 Preferred Stock; (3) the rights
to designate and elect the Series A Directors and the Series B Directors set forth in Section 5(b)
shall be omitted from the terms of such new Series A-1 Preferred Stock and Series B-1 Preferred

Stock; and (4) the initial Conversion Prices applicable to such new Series A-1 Preferred Stock or

Series B-1 Preferred Stock shall initially be the Conversion Prices for the Series A Preferred
Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, respectively, in effect immediately prior to the closing of
such Dilutive Issuance. Except as contemplated by this Section 4(h)(1) from and after the date
of filing such articles supplementary or articles of amendment, the term “Series A Preferred
Stock” as used herein shall be deemed to include such new series of Series A-1 Preferred Stock
and each other additional series of Series A Preferred Stock subsequently created pursuant to this
Section 4(h) and the term “Series B Preferred Stock” as used herein shall be deemed to include
such new series of Series B-1 Preferred Stock and each other additional series of Series B
Preferred Stock subsequently created pursuant to this Section 4(h);

(B) effective upon the filing by the Corporation
of such articles supplementary pursuant to Section 2-208 of the MGCL, or articles of
amendment, all shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock held by such
Non-Participating Holder shall automatically be converted into, in the case of Series A Preferred
Stock, an equivalent number of shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, and in the case of Series B
Preferred Stock, an equivalent number of Series B-1 Preferred Stock (each such conversion shall
be referred to herein as a “Special Mandatory Conversion”).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the terms of this Section 4(h) shal! not apply to a

Dilutive Issuance if (i) the right of first refusal of all of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock

or Series B Preferred Stock under Section 2.3 of the Investors’ Rights Agreement with respect to

such Dilutive Issuance is waived at the written request of the Corporation; or (ii) the Corporation

fails to comply with the terms and conditions of Section 2.3 of the Investors’ Rights Agreement.

In determining whether a holder of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock has
16

Articles_of_ Amendment_and_Restatement--2011_Offering
6/7/2007

purchased its pro rata share of a Dilutive Issuance for purposes of this Section 4(h), any portion
of a Dilutive Issuance purchased by an affiliate of a holder of Series A Preferred Stock or Series
B Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have been purchased by such holder of Series A Preferred
Stock or Series B Preferred Stock.

(ii) | All Non-Participating Holders shall be given written
notice of the Special Mandatory Conversion and the place designated for mandatory conversion
of all their shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock pursuant to this
Section 4(h). Such notice shall be sent by first class or registered mail, postage prepaid, to each
Non-Participating Holder, at such holder’s address last shown on the records of the transfer agent
for the Corporation’s stock (or the records of the Corporation, if it serves as its own transfer
agent). Upon receipt of such notice, each Non-Participating Holder shall surrender his or its
certificate or certificates for all such shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred
Stock to the Corporation at the place designated in such notice, and shall thereafter receive
certificates for the number of shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock or Series B-1 Preferred Stock
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Section 4(h). On the effective date of the Special
Mandatory Conversion, all rights with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock or Series B
Preferred Stock so converted will terminate, except only the rights upon surrender of the
certificate or certificates representing such shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B
Preferred Stock to receive certificates for the number of shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock or
Series B-1 Preferred Stock into which such Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock
has been converted; provided that the right of any Non-Participating Holder to receive any
declared but unpaid dividends on their shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred
Stock shall accrue to the benefit of the shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock or Series B-1
Preferred Stock issued upon conversion of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B
Preferred Stock. If so required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall
be endorsed or accompanied by written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory
to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or by his or its attorney duly
authorized in writing. As soon as practicable after the effective date of the Special Mandatory
Conversion and the surrender of the certificate or certificates for Series A Preferred Stock or
Series B Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall cause to be issued and delivered to such holder a
certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock or Series B-
1 Preferred Stock, as the case may be, issuable on such conversion in accordance with the
provisions hereof. All certificates evidencing shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B
Preferred Stock which are required to be surrendered for conversion in accordance with the
provisions hereof shall, from and after the effective date of the Special Mandatory Conversion,
be deemed to have been retired and cancelled and the shares of Series A Preferred Stock or
Series B Preferred Stock represented thereby converted into Series A-1 Preferred Stock or Series
B-1 Preferred Stock for all purposes, notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof
to surrender such certificates on or prior to such date. Such converted Series A Preferred Stock
or Series B Preferred Stock may not be reissued, and the Corporation may thereafter take such
appropriate action (without the need for stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the
authorized number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock
accordingly.

(iii) If, after the occurrence of a Special Mandatory
Conversion, the Corporation effects an additional Dilutive Issuance and there are Non-
17

Articles_of_Amendment_and_Restatement--2011_Offering
6/7/2007

Participating Holders with respect to such additional Dilutive Issuance, then the provisions of
Section 4(h) above shall apply to such additional Dilutive Issuance, except that the series of
Preferred Stock designated by the Corporation shall be Series A-2 Preferred Stock (or, for
subsequent Dilutive Issuances, Series A-3 Preferred Stock, Series A-4 Preferred Stock, etc.) or
Series B-2 Preferred Stock (or, for subsequent Dilutive Issuances, Series B-3 Preferred Stock,
Series B-4 Preferred Stock, etc.), as the case may be, and the Series A Preferred Stock or Series
B Preferred Stock held by the Non-Participating Holders with respect to such additional Dilutive
Issuance shall convert into Series A-2 Preferred Stock (or, for subsequent Dilutive Issuances,
Series A-3 Preferred Stock, Series A-4 Preferred Stock, etc.), or Series B-2 Preferred Stock (or,
for subsequent Dilutive Issuances, Series B-3 Preferred Stock, Series B-4 Preferred Stock, etc.),
as the case may be, and, for purposes of such additional Dilutive Issuance, all references in
Sections 4(h)(i) and 4(h)(ii) above to Series A-1 Preferred Stock or Series B-1 Preferred Stock
shall be deemed to refer to Series A-2 Preferred Stock (or, for subsequent Dilutive Issuances,
Series A-3 Preferred Stock, Series A-4 Preferred Stock, etc.) or Series B-2 Preferred Stock (or,
for subsequent Dilutive Issuances, Series B-3 Preferred Stock, Series B-4 Preferred Stock, etc.).

(iv) | The provisions of this Section 4(h) shall cease to be
applicable to any holder of Series B Preferred Stock who shall have purchased, after the Filing
Date, additional shares of capital stock of the Corporation having an aggregate purchase price
equal to the aggregate purchase price of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock purchased by such
holder pursuant to that certain Series B Convertible Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of
December 17, 2004, by and among the Corporation and the purchasers of Series B Preferred
Stock party thereto.

(i) No Fractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments.

(i) No fractional shares shall be issued upon the
conversion of any share or shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and
Series C Preferred Stock and the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued shall be
rounded to the nearest whole share. Whether or not fractional shares are issuable upon such
conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Series A Preferred
Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock the holder is at the time converting
into Common Stock and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such aggregate
conversion.

(ii) Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Conversion Prices of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and
Series C Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation, at its expense, shall
promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and
prepare and furnish to each holder of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and
Series C Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing
in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall,
upon the written request at any time of any holder of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock , furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a
like certificate setting forth (A) such adjustment and readjustment, (B) the Conversion Prices for
any series of such holder’s Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series C
Preferred Stock at the time in effect, and (C) the number of shares of Common Stock and the

18
Articles_of_Amendment_and_Restatement--2011_ Offering
6/7/2007

amount, if any, of other property that at the time would be received upon the conversion of a
share of any of such holder’s Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series C
Preferred Stock.

(j) Notices of Record Date. In the event of any taking by the
Corporation of a record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining
the holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend) or other
distribution, any right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of stock of any
class or any other securities or property, or to receive any other right, or to effect any
recapitalization or reclassification of its Common Stock outstanding involving a change in the
Common Stock, the Corporation shall mail, postage prepaid, to each holder of Series A Preferred
Stock, each holder of Series B Preferred Stock and each holder of Series C Preferred Stock, at
least twenty (20) days prior to the date specified therein, a notice specifying the date on which
any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or right, and the
amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right.

(k) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The
Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares

of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Series
A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock, the full number of its
shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all
outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C
Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common
Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Series
A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock, in addition to such
other remedies as shall be available to the holder of such Series A Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock, the Corporation, at its expense, will take such
corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but
unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such
purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite
stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to this certificate.

(1) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this
Section 4 to be given to the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred
Stock and Series C Preferred Stock: (a) shall be in writing; (b) shall be sent by (i) messenger, (ii)
certified or registered U.S. mail, or (iii) a reliable express delivery service or telefacsimile,
charges prepaid as applicable, addressed to each holder of record at his address appearing on the
books of the Corporation); and (c) will be deemed to have been given on the second business day
after the date of receipt by the addressee, as evidenced by (i) a receipt executed by the addressee
(or a responsible person in his or her office), the records of the person delivering such
communication or a notice to the effect that such addressee refused to claim or accept such
