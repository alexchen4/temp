Series Preferred.

and other contingent payments)), the amount of cash, securities or other property to which such
holder would be entitled to receive in a Liquidation Event pursuant to Sections 3(a), 3(b) and
3(d) immediately above.

(b) For the purposes of this Section 4: (i) “Acquisition” shall mean any
consolidation or merger of the Company with or into any other corporation or other entity or
person, or any other corporate reorganization, in which the stockholders of the Company
immediately prior to such consolidation, merger or reorganization, own less than fifty percent

provisions of this Section 5, any shares of Series Preferred may, at the option of the holder, be -
converted at any time into fully-paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock. The number
of shares of Common Stock to which a holder of Series Preferred shall be entitled upon
conversion shall be the product obtained by multiplying the applicable “Series Preferred
Conversion Rate” then in effect (determined as provided in Section 5(b)) by the number of
shares of Series Preferred being converted.

(b) Series Preferred Conversion Rate. The conversion rate in effect at
any time for conversion of each series of Series Preferred (the “Series Preferred Conversion
Rate”) shall be the quotient obtained by dividing the Original Issue Price of the Series Preferred
with respect to such series by the applicable “Series Preferred Conversion Price,” calculated as
provided in Section 5(c).

(c) Series Preferred Conversion Price. The conversion price for the
Series Preferred shall initially be the Original Issue Price of such Series Preferred (the ‘Series
Preferred Conversion Price’). Each such initial Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be
adjusted from time to time in accordance with this Section 5. All references to any Series
Preferred Conversion Price herein shall mean the applicable Serics Preferred Conversion Price as
so adjusted.

desires to convert the same into shares of Common Stock pursuant to this Section 5 shall
surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Company or

office that such holder elects to convert the same. Such notice shall state the number of shares
and series of Series Preferred being converted, Thereupon, the Company shall promptly issue
and deliver at such office to such holder a certlficate or certificates for the number of shares of
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled and shall promptly pay (i) in cash or, to the
extent sufficient funds are not then legally available therefor, in Common Stock (at the Common
Stock’s fair market value determined by the Board as of the date of such conversion, including a

and Series B-1 Preferred and (2) Series B-2 Preferred) the value of any fractional share of
Common Stock otherwise issuable to any holder of Series Preferred. Such conversion shall be
deemed to have been made at the close of business on the date of such surrender of the
certificates representing the shares of Series Preferred to be converted, and the person entitled to
receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all
purposes as the record holder of such shares of Common Stock on such date.

decreased. Conversely, if at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date the
Company combines the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares

Price in effect immediately before the combination shall be proportionately increased. Any
adjustment under this Section 5(e) shall become effective at the close of business on the date the

any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date the Company pays to holders of

corresponding dividend or other distribution to holders of any serics of Preferred Stock, the
Series Preferred Conversion Price that is then in effect with respect to such series shall be
decreased as of the time of such issuance, as provided below:

(i) The Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be adjusted by
multiplying the Series Preferred Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction equal to:

(A) the numerator of which is the total number of shares
of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance, and

(B) the denominator of which is the total number of
shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance
plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or
distribution;

Gi) If the Company fixes a record date to determine which
holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution, the Series
Preferred Conversion Price shall be fixed as of the close of business on such record date and the
number of shares of Common Stock shall be calculated immediately prior to the close of
business on such record date; and

(iii) If such record date is fixed and such dividend is not fully
paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the Series Preferred
Conversion Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record date
and thereafter the Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this Section
5(£) to reflect the actual payment of such dividend or distribution.

(g) Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange, Substitution,
Reorganization, Merger or Consolidation. If at any time or from time to time after the

or stock dividend or a reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale of assets provided for
elsewhere in this Section 5), in any such event each holder of Series Preferred shall then have the
right to convert such stock into the kind and amount of stock and other securities and property
receivable upon such recapitalization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or other change by
holders of the maximum number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series
Preferred could have been converted immediately prior to such recapitalization, reclassification,
merger, consolidation or change, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein or with
respect to such other securities or property by the terms thereof. In any such case, appropriate
adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 5 with respect to the
rights of the holders of Series Preferred after the capital reorganization to the end that the
provisions of this Section 5 (including adjustment of the applicable Series Preferred Conversion
Price then in effect and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Series Preferred)

single, several or all series of the Serics Preferred (a “Qualifying Dilutive Issuance”), then and in
each such case, the then-existing applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price for such so-
affected single, several or all series of the Series Preferred shall be reduced, as of the opening of
business on the date of such issue or sale to:

(4) in the case of the Series B-2 Preferred prior to an
amendment or waiver of this Subsection E(5) of this Article IV effected pursuant to Subsection
E(2)(c)(v) of this Article IV, a price equal to the lowest price at which any of the Additional
Shares of Common Stock are issued; and

(B)in the case of the Series A-1 Preferred, Series A-2
Preferred, Series B-1 Preferred and, subsequent to an amendment or waiver of this Subsection
E(5) of this Article IV effected pursuant to Subsection E(2)(c)(v) of this Article IV, the Series B-
2 Preferred , a price determined by multiplying the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price
in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale by a fraction equal to:

(1) the numerator of which shall be (A) the number
of shares of Common Stock deemed outstanding (as determined below) immediately prior to

by this Section 5(h) that is not required to be made due to the preceding sentence shall be
included in any subsequent adjustment to the Scries Preferred Conversion Price,

(iii) For the purpose of making any adjustment required under
this Section 5(h), the aggregate consideration reccived by the Company for any issue or sale of

by the Company, (B) to the extent it consists of property other than cash, be computed at the fair
value of that property as determined in good faith by the Board, including a majority of the

the total amount of the consideration, if any, received by the Company for the issuance of such
rights or options or Convertible Securities plus:

(A) in the case of such rights or options, the minimum
amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon the exercise of such rights or
options; and

(B) in the case of Convertible Securities, the minimum
amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon the conversion thereof (other
than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities);
provided that if the minimum amounts of such consideration cannot be ascertained, but are a
function of antidilution or similar protective clauses, the Company shall be deemed to have
received the minimum amounts of consideration without reference to such clauses,

(C) If the minimum amount of consideration payable to
the Company upon the exercise or conversion of rights, options or Convertible Securities is
reduced over time or on the occurrence or non-occurrence of specified events other than by
reason of antidilution adjustments, the Effective Price shall be recalculated using the figure to
which such minimum amount of consideration is reduced; provided further, that if the minimum
amount of consideration payable to the Company upon the exercise or conversion of such rights,
options or Convertible Securities is subsequently increased, the Effective Price shall be again
recalculated using the increased minimum amount of consideration payable to the Company
upon the exercise or conversion of such rights, options or Convertible Securities,

(D) No further adjustment of the Series Preferred
Conversion Price, as adjusted upon the issuance of such rights, options or Convertible Securities,
shall be made as a4 result of the actual issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock or the
exercise of any such rights or options or the conversion of any such Convertible Securities. If
any such rights or options or the conversion privilege represented by any such Convertible
Securities shall expire without having been exercised, the Series Preferred Conversion Price as
adjusted upon the issuance of such rights, options or Convertible Securities shall be readjusted to
the Serics Preferred Conversion Price which would have been in effect bad an adjustment been
made on the basis that the only Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued were the
Additional Shares of Common Stock, if any, actually issued or sold on the excrcise of such rights
or options or rights of conversion of such Convertible Securities, and such Additional Shares of
Common Stock, if any, were issued or sold for the consideration actually received by the
Company upon such exercise, plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the Company
for the granting of all such rights or options, whether or not exercised, plus the consideration
received for issuing or selling the Convertible Securities actually converted, plus the
consideration, if any, actually received by the Company (other than by cancellation of liabilities
or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities) on the conversion of such Convertible
Securities, provided that such readjustment shall not apply to prior conversions of Series
Preferred.
