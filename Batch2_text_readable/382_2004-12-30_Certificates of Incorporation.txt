of the Series A Stock have been paid their Preferential Dividend in full, then the holders of

Series A Stock and Common Stock shall share ratably in any additional dividends during such
fiscal year on an as converted basis (i.e., the number of shares of Common Stock which would be

Series A Preferred Stock remain unpaid.

(3) Payment Other Than Cash. If the Corporation shall declare a
distribution payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by the
Corporation or other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights to purchase
any such securities or evidences of indebtedness, then, in each such case, the holders of Series A
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any such distribution as though the
holders of Series A Preferred Stock were the holders of the number of shares of Comraon Stock
of the Corporation into which their respective shares of Series A Preferred Stock are convertible
as of the record date fixed for the determination of the holders of Common Stock of the
Corporation who are entitled to receive such distributivu.

exceed five (5) years following the Filing Date, less the amount, if any, of any dividends actually
paid to the Series A Stock through the date of Liquidation, or (B) any declared and unpaid

proceeds distributed to all shareholders of the Company so jong as they have received no Icss

Corporation and any other corporation (in which consolidation or merger or plan of exchange
any shareholders of the Corporation receive distributions of cash or securities or other property)

shares, at the principal office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for the Corporation's
shares, without payment of additional consideration by the holder and into that number of fully
paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock which is equal to the quotient obtained by
dividing the Issuance Price (Appropriately Adjusted) by the Series A Conversion Price (as such
term is hereinafter defined), determined as provided below, in effect on the applicable
determination date. The conversion price (the “Series A Conversion Price’) at which shares of

-6-
DOCSSFO-12387496.6-GUSTERMAN
Common Stock will be deliverable upon the conversion of a share of Series A Stock without the
payment of additional consideration by the holder thereof shall initially be the Issuance Price;
provided, however, that the Series A Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment from time
to time as herein provided.

(2) Mechanics of Conversion. Each holder of outstanding shares of Series A
Stock who desires to convert the same into shares of Common Stock shall surrender the
certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the principal office of this Carporation or of
any transfer agent for the Corporation's shares and shall give written notice to this Corporation at

shares of Series A Stock being converted. Thereupon, this Corporation shall issue and deliver at
such office to such holder a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock
to which such holder is entitled and shall promptly pay all declared but unpaid dividends on the
shares being converted. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior
to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the certificate or certificates representing
the shares to be converted, and the person entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock
issuatle upon such cenversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such
shares of Common Stock on such date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the conversion is in
connection with a Liquidation, Qualified IPO (as defined in Subsection (d)(11)(i) below) or the
public registration of the Corporation’s securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the ‘Securities Act”), the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering Series A
Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing of such transaction or series of
related transactions, in which event the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such
Series A Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the final closing of such transaction or series
of transactions.

(3) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If this Corporation at
any time or from time to time after the Filing Date effects a division of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock, the Series A Conversion Price shall be proportionately decreased and,
conversely, if this Corporation at any time. or from time to time, after the Filing Date combines
the outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Series A Conversion Price shall be proportionately
increased. Any adjustment under this Subsection (d)(3) shall be effective on the close of
business on the date such division or combination becomes effective.

(4) Adju t_ for d D . If this
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Filing Date pays or fixes a record date for
the determination of holders of shares of Common Stock entitled to receive a dividend or other
distribution in the form of shares of Common Stock, or rights or options for the purchase of, or
securities convertible into, Common Stock, then in each such event the Series A Conversion
Price shall be decreased, as of the time of such payment or, in the event a record date is fixed, as
of the close of business on such record date, by multiplying the Series A Conversion Price by a
fraction (i) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the time of such payment or the close of business on such

-7-
DOCSSFO-12387495.6-GOSTERMAN
record date and (ii) the denominator of which shall be (A) the total number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to ike time of such puyment or the close of business on such
record date plus (B) the number of shares of Cominon Stock issuable in payment of such
dividend or distribution or upon exercise of such option or right of conversion; provided,
however, that if a record date is fixed and such dividend is not fully paid or such other
distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the Series A Conversion Price shall not
be decreased as of the close of business on such record date as hereinabove provided as to the
portion not fully paid or distributed and thereafter the Series A Conversion Price shall be
decreased pursuant to this Subsection (d)(4) as of the date or dates of actual payment of such
dividend or distribution.

(5) Adjustments for Other Dividends _and_ Distributions. If this
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Filing Date pays, or fixes a record date for

the determination of holders of shares of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other
distribution in the form of securities of this Corporation other than shares of Common Stock or
rights or cptions for the purchase of, or securities convertible into, Common Stock, tnen in each
such event provision shall be made sc that the holders of the outstanding shares of Series A
Stock shall receive upon conversion thereof, in addition to the number of shares of Common
Stock receivable thereupon, the amount of securities of this Corporation which they would have
received had their respective shares of Series A Stock been converted into shares of Common
Stock on the date of such event and had such holders thereafter, from the date of such event to
and including the actual date of conversion of their shares, retained such securities, subject to all
other adjustments called for during such period under this Section (d) with respect to the rights of
the holders of the outstanding shares of Serics A Stock.

(6) Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. If, at any

time or from time to time after the Filing Date, the number of shares of Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of the shares of Series A Stock is changed into the same or a different numbei
of shares of any other class or classes of stock or other securities, whether by recapitalization.
reclassification or otherwise (other than a recapitalization, division or combination of shares /r
stock dividend or a reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale of assets provided for elsewhere
in this Section (d)), then, in any such event, each holder of outstanding shares of Series A Stock
shall have the right thereafter to convert such shares of Series A Stock into the same kind ard
amount of stock and other securities receivable upon such recapitalization, reclassification or
other change, as the maximum number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares uf
Series A Stock could have been converted immediately prior to such recapitalization,
reclassification or change, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein.

(7) Reorganizations, Mergers, Copsolidations or Sales of Assets. /f. at any

time or from time to time after the Filing Date, there is a capital reorganization of tne Common

provided for elsewhere in this Section (d)) or a merger or consolidation of this Corporation into
or with another corporation or a sale of all or substantially all of this Corporation's properties and
assets to any other person (other than a merger or consolidation or sale which is deemed a

-8-
DOCSSFO-12387405.6-GOSTERMAN
Liquidation pursuant to Subsection (b)(3)), then, as a part of such capital reorganization, merger,
consolidation or sale, provision shall be made so that the holders of the outstanding shares of
Series A Stock shall thereafter receive upon conversion thereof the number of shares of stock or
other securities or property of this Corporation, or of the successor corporation resulting from
such merger or consolidation or sale, to which a holder of the number of shares of Common
Stock into which their shares of Series A Stock were convertible would have been entitled on
such capital reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale. In any such case, appropriate
adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section (d) with respect to
the rights of the holders of the outstanding shares of Series A Stock after the capital
reorganization, merger, consolidation, or sale to the end that the provisions of this Section (d)
(including adjustment of the Series A Conversion Price and the number of shares into which the
shares of Series A Stock may be converted) shall be applicable after that event and be as nearly
equivalent to such Conversion Price and number of shares as may be practicable.

(8) Sale of Shares Below Conversion Price/EBITDA Adjustment.

(i) If, at any time or from time to time after the Filing Date, this
Corporation issues, or is deemed by the express provisions of this Subsection (d){8) to have
issued, Additional Shares of Common Stock (as defined in Clause (iv) below) for consideration
per share less than the Series A Conversion Price in effect on the date of and immediately prior
to such issuance, then the Series A Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently with such
issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying the Series A
Conversion Price then in effect, by a fraction, tne numerator of which shall be the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately vrior to such issuance plus the number of
shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for the
total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued would purchase at the Series A
Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance, and the denominator of which
shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance
plus the number of such Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued. Foi the purpose of the
above calculation, the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such
issuance shall be calculated on a fully diluted basis, 2s if all Convertible Securities (as defined
below) had been fully converted into shares of Common Stock and any outstanding Options (as
defined below) bearing an exercise price which is lower than the price at which the Additional
Shares of Common Stock were issued had been fully exercised (and the resulting securities fully
converted into shares of Common Stock, if so convertible) as of such date. "Convertible
Securities" means any evidences of indebtedness, shares (other than Common Stock) or other
securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock, and "Options" means rights,
options or warrants to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire either Common Stock or
Convertible Securities.

(ii) For the purpose of making any adjustment required under this
Subsection (d)(8), the consideration received by this Corporation for any issuance of securities
shall (A) to the extent it consists of property other than cash, be the fair value of that property as
reasonably determined in accordance with the procedures set forth in Subsection (b}(4)(iii) above

-9.
DOCSSF 0-12387495.6-GOSTERMAN
in the event of a Liquidation; and (B) if Additional Shares of Common Stock, Convertible
Securities or Options are issued together with other stock or securities or other assets of this
Corporation for a consideration which covers both, be the portion of the consideration so
received reasonably determined by the Board of Directors to be allocable to such Additional
Shares of Common Stock, Convertible Securities or Options. Where the Corporation receives no
consideration per share, the Corporation shall nonetheless be deemcd to have received
consideration of $0.0001 per share for purposes of the adjustments required under this
Subsection (d)(8).

(iii) For the purpose of the adjustment required under this Subsection (d)(8), if
this Corporation issues any Convertible Securities or Options (other than Options to purchase
Convertible Securities), this Corporation shall be deemed to have issued, at the time of the
issuance of such Convertible Securities or Options, Additional Shares of Common Stock equal to
the maximum number of Additional Shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise or
conversion of such Convertible Securities or Options and to have received as consideration
therefor an amount equal to (A) the total amount of the consideration, if any, received by this
Corporation for the issuance of such Convertible Securities or Options plus (B) in the case of
Options, the minimum amount of consideration, if any, payable to this Corporation upon the
exercise thereof or, in the case of Convertible Securities, the minimum amount of consideration,
if any, payable to this Corporation upon the conversion thereof. Thereafter, no further
adjustment of the Series A Conversion Price shall be made as a result of the actual issuance of
Additional Shares of Common Stock on the exercise of any such Options or the conversion of
any such Convertible Securities. If any such Options or the conversion privilege represented by
any such Convertible Securities shall expire or otherwise terminate without having been
exercised, the Series A Conversion Price shall thereafter be the Series A Conversion Price which
would have been in effect had an adjustment been made on the basis that the only Additional
Shares of Common Stock so issued were the Additional Shares of Common Stock, if any,
actually issued on the exercise of such Options or rights of conversion of such Convertible
Securities, and were issued for the consideration actually received by this Corporation upon such
exercise plus (A) the consideration, if any, actually received for the granting of all such Options
whether or not exercised, (B) the consideration, if any, actually received by issuing the
Convertible Securities actually converted ~nd (C) the consideration, if any, actually received on
the conversion of such Convertible Securities. However, if any such Options or Convertible
Securities by their terms provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any increase in the
consideration payable to the Corporation, upon the exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, the
Series A Conversion Price, and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall upon any such
increase or decrease becoming effective be recomputed to reflect such increase or decrease
insofar as it affects such Options or the rights of conversion or exchange under such Convertible
Securities,

(iv) For the purpose of the adjustment required under this Subsection (d)(8), if
this Corporation issues any Options to purchase Convertible Securities, this Corporation shall be
deemed to have issued, at the time of the issuance of such Options, Additional Shares of
Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the

-10-
DOCSS8F0-12387495.6-GOSTERMAN
total number of Convertible Securities covered by such Options (as set forth in the legal
instruments setting forth the terms of such Convertible Securities) and to have received as
consideration therefor an amount equa! to the amount of consideration, if any, received for the
issuance of such Options plus (A) the minimum amount of consideration, if any, payable upon
the exercise of such Options and (B) the minimum amount of consideration, if any, payable upon
the conversion of such Convertible Securities. No further adjustment of the Series A Conversion
Price shall be made as a result of the actual issuance of the Convertible Securities upon the
exercise of such Options or upon the actual] issuance of shares of Common Stock upon the
conversion of such Convertible Securities. The provisions of Subsection (d)(8)(iii) for the
adjustment of the Series A Conversion Price upon the expiration of Options or the rights of
conversion of Convertible Securities shall apply mutatis mutandis upon the expiration of the
Options and Convertible Securities referred to in this Clause (iv).

(v) For purposes of this Subsection (d)(8), "Additional Shares of
Common Stock" shall mean all shares of Common Stock issued or deemed to be issued under
this Subsection (d\(8) after the Filing Date. However, the following securities (including, where
such securities are Options or Convertible Securities, Common Stock that may be purchased
upon exercise or conversion thereof) shall! not be "Additional Shares of Common Stock:" (A) any
securities issued pursuant to an adjustment required to be made pursuant to Subsection (d)(3),
(¢)(4), (d)(5), (d)(6) or (d)(7); (B) any Options heretofore or hereafter granted under the
