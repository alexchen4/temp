authority to issue is 175,000,000, of which 100,000,000 shares are Common Stock with a par
value of $.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”), and 75,000,000 shares are Preferred Stock
with a par value of $.0001 per share (the “Preferred Stock”). The number of authorized shares of
Common Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares of Common
Stock then outstanding and reserved for issuance in respect of securities convertible into or
exercisable for shares of Common Stock) by an affirmative vote of the holders of at least 60% of
the voting power of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation (the Preferred
Stock and Common Stock voting together as a single class), irrespective of the provisions of
Section 242(b)(2) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware; provided, however,
if such affirmative vote is not obtained in any instance solely because one of the Major Preferred
Stockholders (as defined in the Second Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement dated as
of May 11, 2006, as amended, by and among the Corporation and its stockholders (the
“Stockholders Agreement”)) fails to approve such increase and al] other Major Preferred
Stockholders approve such increase, then subject to applicable Delaware General Corporation
Law, such increase shal] nevertheless be deemed to be approved, if at least a majority of the
voting power of the outstanding shares of the outstanding capital stock of the Corporation, voting
together as a single class, vote to approve such increase.

The Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time by the Board of Directors as herein
provided in one or more series. The designations, relative rights (including voting rights),
preferences, limitations and restrictions of the Preferred Stock, and particularly of the shares of
each series thereof, may, to the extent permitted by law, be similar to or may differ from those of
any other series. The Board of Directors of the Corporation is hereby expressly granted
authority, subject to the provisions of this Article Fourth, to issue from time to time Preferred
Stock in one or more series in addition to the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the ‘Series
A Preferred Stock’), the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series B Preferred Stock”),

Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series D Preferred Stock”), the Series E Convertible Preferred
Stock (the “Series E Preferred Stock”) and the Series E-1 Convertible Preferred Stock (the
“Series E-] Preferred Stock”) created by Section VI and to fix from time to time before issuance
thereof, by filing a certificate of designations pursuant to the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware, the number of shares in each such series and all designations, relative rights
(including the right, to the extent permitted by law, to convert into shares of any class or into
shares of any series of any class), preferences, qualifications, limitations and restrictions of the
shares in each such series (provided that such rights, preferences, qualifications, limitations and
restrictions are not inconsistent with the rights, preferences and limitations of the outstanding
Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred
Stock, Series E Preferred Stock or Series E-1 Preferred Stock).

Subject to the foregoing, the rights, preferences, voting powers, qualifications,
limitations, restrictions and special or relative rights or privileges of the Common Stock, the

(c) (i) For purposes of this Section I, unless otherwise determined by the holders of
75% of the outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class, a
Liquidation Event shal] be deemed to occur upon the occurrence of any transaction or series of
related transactions: (1) involving the merger or consolidation of the Corporation, or a subsidiary
of the Corporation, into or with another entity (other than a transaction or series of related
transactions in which the holders of the voting securities of the Corporation outstanding
immediately prior to such transaction continue to retain (either by such voting securities
remaining outstanding or by such voting securities being converted into voting securities of the
surviving entity), as a result of securities in the Corporation held by such holders prior to such
transaction, more than 50% of the total voting power represented by the voting securities of the
Corporation or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such transaction or series of
transactions, determined on an as-if-converted basis), or (2) that constitute the sale, lease,
transfer, exchange, exclusive license or other conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets
of the Corporation (each such transaction, a “Deemed Liquidation Event”); provided, however, if
such determination is not made in any instance solely because one of the Major Preferred
Stockholders fails to make such determination and all other Major Preferred Stockholders make
such determination, then subject to applicable Delaware General Corporation Law, such
determination shal} nevertheless be deemed to have been made.

(ii) If the Corporation effects any transaction that constitutes a Deemed
Liquidation Event pursuant to this Section I(c) and the provisions of Section I(c)\i) are not
waived as set forth therein, the holders of Preferred Stock shall have the right to receive (and
proper provision shall be made, including by the successor or acquiring entity in such
transaction, so that the holders of Preferred Stock shall receive) out of the proceeds of such
transaction (including any stock, securities, cash or other property to be received by the
Corporation or its stockholders in such transaction) their respective liquidation preferences in the
same manner as set forth in Section 1{a) above.

(iii) | 1fthe Corporation effects any transaction in which the shares of Common
Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property
and such transaction does not constitute a Deemed Liquidation Event pursuant to this Section
I(c) or if the provisions of Section I(c)(i) are waived as set forth therein, then in any such case the
Preferred Stock will continue to be outstanding on the same terms and conditions as set forth
herein, except that if the Corporation does not exist after such event, the successor corporation or

A-4
ultimate parent thereof, if applicable, will, as a condition to the effectiveness of such transaction,
be required to issue to the holders of each series of Preferred Stock securities with the same
rights, preferences and privileges as such series of Preferred Stock.

(iv) | The Corporation shall give each holder of record of Preferred Stock
written notice of an impending transaction described in Section I(c){iii) above not later than
15 days prior to the stockholders’ meeting called to approve such transaction, or 15 days prior to
the closing of such transaction, whichever is earlier, and shal] also notify such holders in writing
of the final approval of such transaction by the stockholders. The first of such notices shall
describe the material terms and conditions of such impending transaction and the provisions of
this Section I, and the Corporation shall thereafter give such holders notice of any materia]
changes promptly after such material changes are made. Such impending transaction shall in no
event take place sooner than 30 days after the Corporation has given the first notice provided for
herein or sooner than 10 days after the Corporation has given notice of any material changes
provided for herein.

(v) Ifthe consideration received by the Corporation or any holders of its
equity securities in connection with a Deemed Liquidation Event is other than cash, its value will
be deemed its fair market value. Any securities shal] be valued as follows:

(A) Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar
restrictions on free marketability covered by (B) below:

(1) If traded ona national securities exchange or through the
Nasdaq National Market, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the
securities on such exchange or system over the 30 day period ending three days prior to the
closing;

(2) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the
30 day period ending three days prior to the closing; and

(3) If there is no public trading market for such securities, by
the Board of Directors of the Corporation in the good faith exercise of their reasonable business
judgment; provided that, if the holders of at least 75% of the outstanding Preferred Stock object
to such valuation, then the value shall be the fair market value thereof, as mutually determined
by the Corporation and the holders of not less than 75% of the outstanding shares of Preferred
Stock, voting together as a single class; and, provided further, that, if the Board of Directors of
the Corporation and the holders of at least 75% of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock are
unable to reach an agreement, then by independent appraisal by an investment bank hired and
paid by the Corporation, but reasonably acceptable to the holders of at least 75% of the
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class.

(B) The method of valuation of securities subject to investment letter
or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of a
shareholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount
from the fair market value determined as above in (A) (1), (2) or (3) to reflect the approximate

A-5
fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Corporation and the holders of not Jess
than 75% of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class; and,
provided further, that, if, the Corporation and the holders of at least 75% of the outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock are unable to reach an agreement, then by independent appraisal by an
investment bank hired and paid by the Corporation, but reasonably acceptable to the holders of at
least 75% of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class.

(vi) In the event the requirements of this Section I(c) which must occur prior to
closing of such Deemed Liquidation Event are not complied with by the Corporation, the
Corporation shall forthwith either:

(A) cause such closing to be postponed until such time as the
requirements of this Section I(c) have been complied with; or

(B) cancel such transaction, in which event the rights, preferences and
privileges of the holders of the Preferred Stock shall revert to and be the same as such rights,
preferences and privileges existing immediately prior to the cancellation of such transaction.

{a) The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock, the
Series C Preferred Stock, the Series D Preferred Stock, the Series E Preferred Stock, the Series

certificate of designations filed pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, the holders
of the Preferred Stock and the holders of the Common Stock shall vote as a single class, upon al]
matters submitted to the stockholders for a vote on the basis that each holder of Preferred Stock
shall have that number of votes per share of Preferred Stock as is equal to the number of shares
of Common Stock into which each respective share of Preferred Stock held by such holder could
be converted on the date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting or on
the effective date of the written consent. The holders of the Common Stock shall be entitled to
one vote for each share of Common Stock registered in the name of such holder. With respect to

Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred
Stock, Series E Preferred Stock and Series E-! Preferred Stock shal] vote together as a single
class separately from the holders of the Common Stock on the basis that each holder of Preferred
Stock shall have the number of votes per share of Preferred Stock as is equal to the number of
shares of Common Stock into which each respective share of Preferred Stock held by such
holder could be converted on the date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the
meeting or the effective date of the written consent.

(c) As long as any shares of Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Corporation shal]
not take any of the following actions without first obtaining the approval (by vote or written
consent, in the manner provided by the Delaware General Corporation Law) of the holders of at
least 70% of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock then held by the Major Preferred

A-6
Stockholders (voting together as a single class, on an as-if converted to Common Stock basis);
provided, however, if such 70% approval is not obtained in any instance solely because one of
the Major Preferred Stockholders fails to approve the action and all other Major Preferred
Stockholders approve the action, then subject to applicable Delaware General Corporation Law,
the action shall nevertheless be deemed to be approved; provided, further, in the case of the
events set forth in clause (iii) below, with respect to actions adversely affecting the rights,
preferences or privileges of any particular series of Preferred Stock or rights or interests of the
holders of such shares in a manner different than or impacting differently than the other series of
Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall not take any of such actions without first obtaining the
approval of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of such affected series of
Preferred Stock:

additional consideration by the holder thereof and at the option of the hoider thereof, at any time
after the date of issuance of such share, at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for
the Preferred Stock, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock
as is determined by dividing the Conversion Value per share (as set forth in Section VI) by the
Conversion Price per share (as set forth in Section VI) in effect at the time of conversion. The
initial Conversion Price with respect to such series of Preferred Stock shall be subject to
adjustment as hereinafter provided.

(b) Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatica}ly be converted into shares of
Common Stock at the then effective Conversion Price upon: (i) the closing of an underwritten
public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended, or any comparable statute then in force, covering the offer and sale of Common
Stock for the account of the Corporation to the public (a “Public Offering”) for a price per share
equal to at least $1.14 (as adjusted for Recapitalization Events) and from which the Corporation
receives gross proceeds of at least $50,000,000 (a “Qualified Public Offering”); or (ii) the
affirmative vote of the holders of 70% of the voting power of the Preferred Stock acting as a
class in accordance with Section IJ(b), after first giving effect, if in connection with a Public
Offering which is not a Qualified Public Offering, to any adjustment of the Conversion Price for
each series of Preferred Stock to which it would otherwise be entitled by virtue of such Public
Offering.

(c) No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of the
Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional] shares to which the holder would otherwise be entitled,

the Corporation shal] pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the then effective applicable
Conversion Price.

A-8
(d) | Upon the occurrence of an event specified in Section III(b), the Preferred Stock
shal} be converted automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and
whether or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its
transfer agent for the Preferred Stock; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be
obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such
conversion unless certificates evidencing such shares of the Preferred Stock being converted are
either delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent, or the holder notifies the Corporation or
its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen, or destroyed and executes an
agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred
by it in connection therewith and, if the Corporation so elects, provides an appropriate indemnity
bond. Upon the automatic conversion of the Preferred Stock pursuant to Section III(b), the
holders of such Preferred Stock shall surrender the certificates representing such shares at the
office of the Corporation or of its transfer agent. Thereupon, there shall be issued and delivered
to such holder, promptly at such office and in his name as shown on such surrendered certificate
or certificates, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which
the shares of the Preferred Stock surrendered were convertible on the date on which such
automatic conversion occurred. From and after the date of the event that causes the automatic
conversion, all rights of the holder with respect to the Preferred Stock so converted shall
terminate, except only the right of such holder, upon the surrender of such holder’s certificate or
certificates therefor, to receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock issuable
upon conversion thereof.

(e) Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into full
shares of Common Stock (except as provided in Section III(b)), such holder shall surrender the
certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of its transfer
agent for the Preferred Stock and shaj! give written notice to the Corporation at such office that
he elects to convert the same and shall state therein the holder’s name or the name or names of
the holder’s nomiriee in which the holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of
Common Stock to be issued. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and
deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to the holder’s nominee, a certificate
or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which he shall be entitled as
aforesaid, together with cash in lieu of any fraction of a share. Such conversion shall be deemed
to have been made on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted
and notice as herein provided, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion shal] be treated for al] purposes as the record holder or
holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date or, if such date is a weekend or legal
holiday, the next succeeding business day. From and after such date, all rights of the holder with
respect to the Preferred Stock so converted shall terminate.

(ii) (1) — Inthe event that the Corporation at any time or from time to time
after December 18, 2007 shall issue any Options or Convertible Securities or shall fix a record
date for the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive any such
Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of shares (as set forth in the
instrument relating thereto without regard to any provisions contained therein for a subsequent
adjustment of such number) of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Options or, in
the case of Convertible Securities and Options therefor, the exercise of such Options and
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to be Additional Shares
of Common Stock issued as of the time of such issue of such Options or Convertible Securities
or, in case such a record date shal! have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record
date, provided that Additional Shares of Common Stock shall not be deemed to have been issued
unless the consideration per share (determined pursuant to Section III(f{iv)) of such Additional
Shares of Common Stock would be less than the Conversion Price with respect to any series of
Preferred Stock in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such issue, or such record date,
as the case may be, and provided further that in any such case in which Additional Shares of
Common Stock are deemed to be issued:

(A) no further adjustment in the Conversion Price shall be
made upon the subsequent issue of Options or Convertible Securities or shares of Common Stock
upon the exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities;

(B) if such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms

provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any increase or decrease in the consideration
payable to the Corporation, or increase or decrease in the number of shares of Common Stock

A-10
issuable, upon the exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, the Conversion Price computed
upon the original issuance thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto),
and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon any such increase or decrease
becoming effective, be recomputed to reflect such increase or decrease insofar as it affects the
rights of exercise under such Options or the rights of conversion or exchange under such
Convertible Securities;

(C) upon the expiration of any such Options or any rights of
conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities that shall not have been exercised, the
Conversion Price computed upon the origina] issuance thereof (or upon the occurrence of a
record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon
such expiration, be recomputed as if:

(i) in the case of Options or Convertible Securities, the
only Additional Shares of Common Stock issued were the shares of Common Stock, if any,
actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities and the consideration received therefor was the consideration actually
received by the Corporation for the issue of al] such Options, plus the consideration actually
received by the Corporation upon such exercise, or the consideration actually received by the
Corporation for the issue of all such Convertible Securities that were actually converted or
exchanged, plus the additional consideration, if any, actually received by the Corporation upon
such conversion or exchange; and

(ii) sin the case of Options for Convertible Securities,
only the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were issued at
the time of issue of such Options, and the consideration received by the Corporation for the
Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been then issued was the consideration
actually received by the Corporation for the issue of all such Options, whether or not exercised,
plus the consideration deemed to have been received by the Corporation (determined pursuant to
Section IJI(f)(iv)) upon the issue of the Convertible Securities with respect to which such
Options were actually exercised;

(D) no readjustment pursuant to clause (B) or (C) above shall
have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price to an amount that exceeds the lower of (i) the
Conversion Price on the original adjustment date, or (ii) the Conversion Price that would have
resulted from any actual issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock between the original
adjustment date and such readjustment date;

(E) _ in the case of any Options that expire by their terms not
more than 30 days after the date of issue thereof, no adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be
made until the expiration or exercise of all such Options, whereupon such adjustment shall be
made in the same manner provided in clause (C) above; and

(F) if such record date shal} have been fixed and such Options

or Convertible Securities are not issued on the date fixed therefor, the adjustment previously
made in the Conversion Price that became effective on such record date shall be canceled as of

A-1]
the close of business on such record date, and thereafter the Conversion Price shall be adjusted
pursuant to this Section IJI(f(ii) as of the actual date of their issuance.

(2) In the event the Corporation at any time or from time to time after
December 18, 2007 shall declare or pay any dividend or make any other distribution on the
Common Stock payable in Common Stock or effect a subdivision of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise other than by payment of a dividend in
Common Stock), then and in any such event, Additional Shares of Common Stock shall be
deemed to have been issued:

(A) _ inthe case of any such dividend or distribution,
immediately after the close of business on the record date for the determination of holders of any
class of securities entitled to receive such dividend or distribution, or

(B) _ inthe case of any such subdivision, when such corporate
action becomes effective.

If such record date shall have been fixed and no part of such dividend or distribution shall have
been paid or made on the date fixed therefor, the adjustment previously made in the Conversion
Price that became effective on such record date shall be canceled as of the close of business on
such record date, and thereafter the Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this

Section III(f)(ii) as of the time of actual payment of such dividend or making of such
distribution.

(iii) | In the event the Corporation shall issue Additional Shares of Common
Stock (including, without limitation, Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued
pursuant to Section III(f)(ii)), without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the
Conversion Price for the Series E Preferred Stock in effect on the date of and immediately prior
to such issuance (a “Dilutive Issuance”), then and in such event, the Conversion Price for each
series of Preferred Stock shall be reduced, concurrently with such Dilutive Issuance as follows:

(1) | Ifany Additional Shares of Common Stock are issued by the
Corporation in a Dilutive Issuance prior to the date (such date, the “Full-Ratchet Termination
Date”) that the Corporation shall have raised not less than $2,000,000 from the sale of its
Preferred Stock in a transaction or series of related transactions occurring after December 18,
2007 (each such Dilutive Issuance, a “Full-Ratchet Issuance”), the Conversion Price shall be
reduced as follows:

(A) _ the Conversion Price for each of the Series E Preferred
Stock and the Series E-1 Preferred Stock shall be reduced to a price equal to the consideration
per share received by the Corporation in such Full-Ratchet Issuance; and

(B) the Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock
other than the Series E Preferred Stock and the Series E-1 Preferred Stock with a Conversion
Price then greater than the consideration per share received by the Corporation in such Full-
Ratchet Issuance shall be reduced by the same percentage that the Conversion Price for the
Series E Preferred Stock and the Series E-] Preferred Stock was reduced pursuant to Section
111(f(iii}( 1 (A) above, but not below the Conversion Price then in effect for the Series E

A-12
Preferred Stock and the Series E-1 Preferred Stock (giving effect to the reduction contemplated
by Section III(fiii}{1 (A) above). By way of example, in the event that Additional Shares of
Common Stock are issued in a Full-Ratchet Issuance at a price of $.19 per share, the Conversion
Price for the Series E Preferred Stock and the Series E-1 Preferred Stock would be reduced to
$.19 per share, which represents 50% of the $.38 Conversion Price for the Series E Preferred
Stock and the Series E-1 Preferred Stock, and the Conversion Price for each series of Preferred
Stock other than the Series E Preferred Stock and the Series E-1 Preferred Stock subject to
adjustment pursuant to this Section III(f)(iii)(1)(B) would be reduced to 50% of the then
applicable Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock, but in any case not below the
Conversion Price (as so adjusted) then in effect for the Series E Preferred Stock and the Series E-
1 Preferred Stock.

(2) ‘If any Additional Shares of Common Stock are issued by the
Corporation in a Dilutive Issuance at any time after the Full-Ratchet Termination Date (each
such Dilutive Issuance, a “Weighted Average Issuance”), (A) the Conversion Price for the Series
E Preferred Stock and the Series E-1 Preferred Stock shall be reduced to a price (calculated to
the nearest tenth of a cent) determined by multiplying such Conversion Price for the Series E
Preferred Stock and the Series E-] Preferred Stock by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be
the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Weighted
Average Issuance plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate
consideration received or deemed to have been received by the Corporation for the total number
of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued or deemed to be issued would purchase at such
Conversion Price and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such Weighted Average Issuance plus the number of such
Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued or deemed to be issued (the “Weighted Average
Formula”) and (B) the Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock other than the Series E
Preferred Stock and Series E-1 Preferred Stock with a then Conversion Price greater than the
consideration per share received by the Corporation in such Weighted Average Issuance shal] be
reduced to the greater of (i) the price (calculated to the nearest tenth of a cent) determined by the
Weighted Average Formula, applying the Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock to
the Weighted Average Formula, or (ii) the price (calculated to the nearest tenth of a cent) by
applying the same percentage that the Conversion Price for the Series E Preferred Stock was
reduced pursuant to Section ITI(f\(iiiK2A) above, but in either case not below the Conversion
Price then in effect for the Series E Preferred Stock and the Serics E-1 Preferred Stock (giving
effect to the reduction contemplated by Section III(f)(iii2)(A) above). By way of example, in
the event that Additional Shares of Common Stock are issued in a Weighted Average Issuance
where the Conversion Price for the Series E Preferred Stock and the Series E-1 Preferred Stock
would be reduced by 25% of its then effective Conversion Price, then the Conversion Price for
each series of Preferred Stock other than the Series E Preferred Stock and the Series E-1
Preferred Stock subject to adjustment pursuant to this Section ITI(f)(iii)(2)(B) would be reduced
by the lesser of the Weighted Average Formula applied to such Conversion Price or by 25% of
the then applicable Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock (but in either case not

below the Conversion Price then in effect for the Series E Preferred Stock and the Series E-]
Preferred Stock).

For the purpose of this Section III(f)(iii), all shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to a Dilutive Issuance and

A-13
the exercise and/or conversion of any other outstanding Convertible Securities (excluding
convertible debt with no fixed conversion price) and all outstanding Options shall be deemed to
be outstanding.

In the event the Corporation, without receiving any consideration, declares a dividend on
Common Stock payable in Common Stock or effects a subdivision of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such stock dividend or subdivision shall, on the date that Additional Shares
of Common Stock are deemed issued pursuant to Section HI(f)(ii)(2), be decreased
proportionately.

(iv) For purposes of this Section III(f), the consideration received by the
Corporation for the issue of any Additional Shares of Common Stock shall be computed as
follows:

(1) Such consideration shall:

(A) _ insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the aggregate
amounts of cash received by the Corporation excluding amounts paid or payable for accrued
interest or accrued dividends;

(B) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors of the Corporation; and

(C) inthe event Additional Shares of Common Stock are issued
together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for consideration that
covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in
clauses (A) and (B) above, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation.

(2) The consideration per share received by the Corporation for

Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued pursuant to Section
I1I(f)(ii)(1), relating to Options and Convertible Securities, shall be determined by dividing (x)
the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Corporation as consideration for the
issuance of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of
additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any
provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration) payable to the
Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such
Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, by (y) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set forth in the
instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent
adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities.

(v) (!) In the event the Corporation shall issue Additional Shares of
Common Stock pursuant to Section III(f)(ii)(2) in a stock dividend, stock distribution or

A-14
subdivision, such Additional Shares of Common Stock shall be deemed to have been issued for
no consideration.

(2) In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be
combined or consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of
Common Stock, the applicable Conversion Price with respect to each series of Preferred Stock in
effect immediately prior to such combination or consolidation shall, concurrently with the
effectiveness of such combination or consolidation, be proportionately increased.

(vi) No adjustment in the number of shares of Common Stock into which the
Preferred Stock is convertible shall be made, by adjustment in the Conversion Price in respect of
the issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock, unless the consideration per share for an
Additional Share of Common Stock issued or deemed to be issued by the Corporation is less than
the applicable Conversion Price in effect on the date of, and immediately prior to, the issuance of
such Additional Share.

(vii) If at any time or from time to time there shall be a recapitalization of the
Common Stock (but not the Preferred Stock) (other than a transaction provided for elsewhere in
this Section III or in Section [), provision shall be made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock
shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of the Preferred Stock the number of
shares of stock or other securities or property of the Corporation or otherwise, to which a holder
of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled on such
recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the
provisions of this Section III with respect to the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock after
the recapitalization to the end that the provisions of this Section III (including adjustment of the
Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock then in effect and the number of shares
purchasable upon conversion of each series of Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that
event as nearly equivalent as shall be reasonably practicable.

(gz) | Except for an amendment approved in accordance with Section II, the
Corporation shall not, by amendment of its Certificate of Incorporation or through any
reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issuance or sale of securities
or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the
terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Corporation but shall at all times in good
faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Section III and in the taking of all such
action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holders
of the Preferred Stock set forth herein against impairment.

(h) — Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the Conversion Price
pursuant to this Section III, the Corporation at its expense shall promptly compute such
adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to each holder of
Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail]
the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon the
written request at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to
such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and readjustments, (ii) the
Conversion Price at the time in effect, and (iii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the

A-15
amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon the conversion of
each share of Preferred Stock.

(i) In the event of any taking by the Corporation of a record of the holders of any
class or series of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof who are entitled to
receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend that is the same as cash dividends paid in
previous quarters) or other distribution, the Corporation shall mail to each holder of each series
of Preferred Stock that is convertible into Common Stock, at least 10 days prior to such record
date, a notice specifying the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such
dividend or distribution.

(j) The Corporation shall reserve and keep available out of its authorized but
unissued Common Stock such number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be
sufficient to effect conversion of the Preferred Stock.

(k) The Corporation shall pay any issue or transfer taxes payable in connection with
the conversion of the Preferred Stock, provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be
required to pay any tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer to a name other than that of
the holder of the Preferred Stock, and no issuance or delivery need be made unless the
Corporation has been paid the amount of such tax or it has been established to the Corporation’s
satisfaction that the tax has been paid.

IV. Dividends.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section IV or in a certificate of designations
filed pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law with respect to any series of Preferred
Stock, the holders of shares of Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to receive dividends.

(b) — The holders of shares of the Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock,
Series E Preferred Stock and Series E-1 Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive dividends as
provided in this Section IV. Dividends on each share of Series C Preferred Stock, Series D
Preferred Stock and Series E Preferred Stock shal] be calculated cumulatively on a daily basis at
the rate of 8% per annum of the Original Issuance Price with respect to such share of Series C
Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock or Series E Preferred Stock commencing on December
18, 2007, whether or not there are (at the time such dividend is calculated or becomes payable or
at any other time) funds of the Corporation Jegally available for the payment of dividends. No
dividends shall accrue or be payable with respect to the shares of the Series C Preferred Stock,
Series D Preferred Stock or Series E Preferred Stock for any period prior to December 18, 2007,
and all previously accrued dividends on those shares shall be forfeited. Dividends on each share
of Series E-1 Preferred Stock shal] be calculated cumulatively on a daily basis at the rate of 8%
per annum of the Original Issuance Price with respect to such share of Series E-1 Preferred Stock
from the Original Issuance Date, whether or not there are (at the time such dividend is calculated
or becomes payable or at any other time) funds of the Corporation legally available for the
payment of dividends. All such dividends shall be cumulative and accrue whether or not such
dividends have been declared and whether or not there are profits, surplus or other funds of the
Corporation legally available for the payment of dividends. Cumulative dividends shall be
payable only pursuant to Section I(a) upon the occurrence of a Liquidation Event and shall be

A-16
forfeited upon the first closing of a Qualified Public Offering. All dividend payments pursuant
to this Section IV(b) shall be made to the holders of Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred
Stock, Series E Preferred Stock and Series E-! Preferred Stock pro rata, and for purposes of such
pro rata payments, each holder of such shares of Preferred Stock shall be treated as owning that
number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Preferred Stock held by such
holder would then be convertible pursuant to Section ITI hereof.

(c) | When and as dividends are declared payable in cash or property, other than shares
of the Corporation’s capital stock, with respect to shares of Common Stock, the Corporation
shall declare at the same time and pay to each holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock,
Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred
Stock and Series E-] Preferred Stock a dividend equal to the dividend that would have been
payable to such holder if the shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series
C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock and Series E-] Preferred
Stock held by such holder had been converted into Common Stock on the record date for the
determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such dividend.

(d) No distributions shal] be declared or paid on any Common Stock of the
Corporation during any fiscal year of the Corporation until dividends in the amounts set forth in
Sections IV(b) and (c) have been paid to, or declared and set apart upon, all outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock during that fiscal year.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Corporation shall
consummate a Qualified Public Offering, all accrued but unpaid dividends on all shares of
Preferred Stock shall be forfeited and shall not be paid to the holders of such Preferred Stock,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Certificate of Incorporation including,
without limitation, Section I{a).

(f) In the event the Corporation shall declare a distribution payable in securities of
other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by the Corporation or other persons, assets
(excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred to in Section HI(f}{ii), in each case as
permitted hereunder, and such distribution does not constitute a Liquidation Event or a deemed
Liquidation Event as set forth in Section J, then, in each such case for the purpose of this
Section IV, the holders of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any
such distribution as though they were the holders of the number of shares of Common Stock of
the Corporation into which their shares of Preferred Stock are convertible as of the record date
fixed for the determination of the holders of Common Stock of the Corporation entitled to
receive such distribution.

V. Redemption at Holders’ Option.

(a) (i) At the election in writing by the holders of at least 70% of the outstanding
shares of Series E-! Preferred Stock (a “Series E-1 Redemption Request”) delivered to the
Corporation at any time after December 18, 2012, the Corporation shall redeem, on the terms and
conditions stated herein and out of funds legally available therefor, 33 1/3% of the outstanding
shares of Series E-1 Preferred Stock no later than 45 days after the Corporation’s receipt of the ~
Series E-1 Redemption Request; provided, however, that if such election is not made in any

A-17
instance solely because one of the Major Preferred Stockholders holding Series E-1 Preferred
Stock fails to make such election and all other Major Preferred Stockholders holding Series E-1
Preferred Stock make such election, then subject to applicable Delaware General Corporation
Law, such election shall nevertheless be deemed to have been made. On or before the one-year
anniversary of the date on which the first redemption occurs or is required to occur, the
Corporation shal! redeem, on the terms and conditions stated herein and out of funds legally
available therefor, 50% of the remaining shares of Series E-1 Preferred Stock. On or before the
two-year anniversary of the date on which the first redemption occurs or is required to occur, the
Corporation shall redeem, on the terms and conditions stated herein and out of funds legally
available therefor, the remaining shares of Series E-1 Preferred Stock. Each date on which an
installment of the Series E-1 Preferred Stock is to be redeemed is referred to below as a “Series
E-1 Redemption Date.” The redemption price per share shall be the Original Issuance Price of
such share, as appropriately adjusted for any Recapitalization Events, plus accrued but unpaid
dividends thereon to the date of actual payment for such redeemed shares (the “Series E-]
Redemption Price”).

(ii) | The shares of Series E-1 Preferred Stock not redeemed pursuant to Section
V(a\(i) because sufficient funds are not legally available therefor shall remain outstanding and
entitled to all the rights and preferences with respect to such shares provided herein. At any time
thereafter when additional funds of the Corporation are legally available for the redemption of
such shares of Series E-] Preferred Stock, such funds shall immediately be used to redeem the
balance of such shares, or such portion thereof for which funds are then legally available, on the
basis set forth above. In case fewer than the total number of shares of Series E-1 Preferred Stock
represented by any certificate are redeemed, a new certificate representing the number of
unredeemed shares shall be issued to the holder thereof without cost to such holder within 10
business days after surrender of the certificate representing the redeemed shares. Any
redemption effected pursuant to this Section V(a) shall be made ratably among the holders of the
Series E-1 Preferred Stock in proportion to the aggregate Series E-1 Redemption Price each such
holder of Series E-1 Preferred Stock would otherwise be entitled to receive on the applicable
Series E-1 Redemption Date.

(iii) Ifthe holders of Series E-] Preferred Stock have elected to have the shares
of Series E-1 Preferred Stock redeemed as provided in Section V(a){i) above, then at Jeast 30
days but no more than 60 days prior to each Series E-1 Redemption Date, the Corporation shall
give written notice by certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, to all holders of shares of
Series E-1 Preferred Stock at the address last shown on the records of the Corporation for such
holder, stating cach Series E-1 Redemption Date and the Series E-1 Redemption Price for such
shares, and shall ca]l upon such holder to surrender to the Corporation on each Series E-]
Redemption Date at the place designated in the notice such holder's certificate or certificates
representing the shares to be redeemed. On or after each Series E-1 Redemption Date stated in
such notice, each holder of the shares of Series E-1 Preferred Stock called for redemption shall
surrender the certificate evidencing such shares to the Corporation at the place designated in such
notice and shal] thereupon be entitled to receive payment of the Series E-] Redemption Price, as
the case may be, for the shares surrendered. If such notice of redemption shall have been duly
given by the Corporation, and if on the Series E-1 Redemption Date funds necessary for the
applicable redemption shall be available therefor, then, as to any certificates evidencing any
Series E-1 Preferred Stock not surrendered, all rights of the holders of such shares not

A-18
surrendered shall cease with respect to such shares, except only the right of the holders to receive
the Series E-1 Redemption Price for the Series E-! Preferred Stock which they hold, without
additional interest, upon surrender of their certificates therefor.

(b) = (i) At the election in writing by the holders of at least 70% of the outstanding
shares of Series E Preferred Stock (a “Series E Redemption Request”) delivered to the
Corporation at any time after such time as all shares of Series E-1 Preferred Stock shall have
been redeemed pursuant to Section V(a), the Corporation shall redeem, on the terms and
conditions stated herein and out of funds legally available therefor, 33 1/3% of the outstanding
shares of Series E Preferred Stock no later than 45 days after the Corporation’s receipt of the

first redemption occurs or is required to occur, the Corporation shall redeem, on the terms and
conditions stated herein and out of funds legally available therefor, 50% of the remaining shares
of Series E Preferred Stock. On or before the two-year anniversary of the date on which the first
redemption occurs or is required to occur, the Corporation shall redeem, on the terms and
conditions stated herein and out of funds legally available therefor, the remaining shares of
Series E Preferred Stock. Each date on which an installment of the Series E Preferred Stock is to
be redeemed is referred to below as a “Series E Redemption Date.” The redemption price per
share shall be the Original Issuance Price of such share, as appropriately adjusted for any
Recapitalization Events, plus accrued but unpaid dividends thereon to the date of actual payment
for such redeemed shares (the “Series E Redemption Price’).

(ii) | The shares of Series E Preferred Stock not redeemed pursuant to Section
V(b){i) because sufficient funds are not legally available therefor shall remain outstanding and
entitled to all the rights and preferences with respect to such shares provided herein. At any time
thereafter when additiona) funds of the Corporation are legally available for the redemption of
such shares of Series E Preferred Stock, such funds shall immediately be used to redeem the
balance of such shares, or such portion thereof for which funds are then legally available, on the
basis set forth above. In case fewer than the total number of shares of Series E Preferred Stock
represented by any certificate are redeemed, a new certificate representing the number of
. unredeemed shares shall be issued to the holder thereof without cost to such holder within 10
business days after surrender of the certificate representing the redeemed shares. Any
redemption effected pursuant to this Section V(a) shall be made ratably among the holders of the
Series E Preferred Stock in proportion to the aggregate Series E Redemption Price each such
holder of Series E Preferred Stock would otherwise be entitled to receive on the applicable Series
E Redemption Date.

(iii) ‘If the holders of Series E Preferred Stock have elected to have the shares
of Series E Preferred Stock redeemed as provided in Section V(b)(i) above, then at least 30 days
but no more than 60 days prior to each Series E Redemption Date, the Corporation shall give
written notice by certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, to all holders of shares of Series E
Preferred Stock at the address last shown on the records of the Corporation for such holder,
stating each Series E Redemption Date and the Series E Redemption Price for such shares, and
shall cal] upon such holder to surrender to the Corporation on each Series E Redemption Date at
the place designated in the notice such holder's certificate or certificates representing the shares
to be redeemed. On or after each Series E Redemption Date stated in such notice, each holder of
the shares of Series E Preferred Stock called for redemption shall surrender the certificate

A-19
evidencing such shares to the Corporation at the place designated in such notice and shall
thereupon be entitled to receive payment of the Series E Redemption Price, as the case may be,
for the shares surrendered. If such notice of redemption shall have been duly given by the
Corporation, and if on the Series E Redemption Date funds necessary for the applicable
redemption shall be available therefor, then, as to any certificates evidencing any Series E
Preferred Stock not surrendered, all rights of the holders of such shares not surrendered shall
cease with respect to such shares, except only the right of the holders to receive the Series E
Redemption Price for the Series E Preferred Stock which they hold, without additional interest,
upon surrender of their certificates therefor.

(c) (i) At the election in writing by the holders of at least 70% of the outstanding
shares of Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class
(a “Series C and Series D Redemption Request”) delivered to the Corporation at any time after
such time as all shares of Series E-! Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed pursuant to
Section V(a), the Corporation shall redeem, on the terms and conditions stated herein and out of
funds legally available therefor, 33 1/3% of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock
and Series D Preferred Stock no later than 45 days after the Corporation’s receipt of the Series C
and Series D Redemption Request. On or before the one-year anniversary of the date on which
the first redemption occurs or is required to occur, the Corporation shall redeem, on the terms
and conditions stated herein and out of funds legally available therefor, 50% of the remaining
shares of Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock. On or before the two-year
anniversary of the date on which the first redemption occurs or is required to occur, the
Corporation shall redeem, on the terms and conditions stated herein and out of funds legally
available therefor, the remaining shares of Series C Preferred Stock and the Series D Preferred
Stock. Each date on which an installment of the Series C Preferred Stock and the Series D
Preferred Stock is to be redeemed is referred to below as a “Series C and Series D Redemption
Date.” The redemption price per share shall be the Original Issuance Price of such share, as
appropriately adjusted for any Recapitalization Events, plus accrued but unpaid dividends
thereon to the date of actual payment for such redeemed shares (the “Series C and Series D
Redemption Price”).

(ii) | The shares of Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock not
redeemed pursuant to Section V(c){i) because sufficient funds are not legally avaijable therefor
shal] remain outstanding and entitled to all the rights and preferences provided herein. At any
time thereafter when additional funds of the Corporation are legally available for the redemption
of such shares of Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock, such funds shal]
