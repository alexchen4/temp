to the amount of loss paid or payable by Indemnitee in such proportion as is appropriate to

benefits received by and fault of the Company on the one hand and the Indemnitce on the other

the Proceeding took place) with reference to, among other things, the parties’ relative intent,
knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent the circumstances
resulting in such loss. The Company agrees that it would not be just and equitable if a

to the amount of loss paid: or payable by Indemnitee in such proportion as is appropriate to

other hand from the transaction from which such Proceeding arose, and the relative fault of the
Company on the one. hand and the Indemnitee on the other hand in connection with the events

benefits received by and fault of the Company on the one hand and the Indemnitee on the other

the Proceeding took place) with reference to, among other things, the parties’ relative intent,
knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent the circumstances
resulting in such loss. The Company agrees that it would not be just and: equitable if a
contribution pursuant to this Article was determined by pro rata allocation or any other method
of allocation which does not take account of the foregoing equitable considerations,

shall not be obligated pursuant to the terms of the Articles to indemnify or advance expenses to
