2. Distributions.

(a) Preferred Stock. In any calendar year, the holders of outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive Distributions, when, as and if declared by the Board of
Directors, out of any assets at the time legally available therefor, at the Dividend Rate specified for such
shares of Preferred Stock payable in preference and priority to any declaration or payment of any
Distribution on Common Stock of the Corporation in such calendar year. No Distributions shall be made
with respect to the Common Stock until all declared Distributions on the Preferred Stock under this
Section 2(a) have been paid or set aside for payment to the Preferred Stock holders. In the event
Distributions are set aside or paid on any share of Common Stock, the Company shall pay an additional
Distribution on all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock in a per share amount equal (on an as-if-
converted to Common Stock basis) to the amount paid or set aside for each share of Common Stock.
Payment of any Distributions to the holders of the Preferred Stock shall be on a pro rata, pari passu basis
in proportion to the Dividend Rates for each Series of Preferred Stock. The right to receive Distributions
on shares of Preferred Stock shall not be cumulative, and no right to such Distributions shall accrue to
holders of Preferred Stock by reason of the fact that Distributions under this Section 2(a) on said shares

California Corporations Code, if Section 502 or Section 503 of the California Corporations Code is
applicable to a payment made by the Corporation then such applicable section or sections shall not apply
if such payment is a payment made by the Corporation in connection with (i) repurchases of Common
Stock issued to or held by employees, officers, directors or consultants of the Corporation or its
subsidiaries upon termination of their employment or services pursuant to agreements providing for the
right of said repurchase, (ii) repurchases of Common Stock issued to or held by employees, officers,
directors or consultants of the Corporation or its subsidiaries pursuant to rights of first refusal contained
in agreements providing for such right, (iii) repurchases of Common Stock or Preferred Stock in
connection with the settlement of disputes with any stockholder, as authorized by the Board of Directors
(including the Preferred Directors), (iv) any other repurchase or redemption of Common Stock or
Preferred Stock approved by the holders of at least fifty-one (51%) percent of the then outstanding
Preferred Stock of the Corporation.

3. Liquidation Rights.

(a) Liquidation Preference. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding
up of the Corporation, either voluntary or involuntary, the holders of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled
to receive, prior and in preference to any Distribution to the holders of the Common Stock by reason of
their ownership of such stock, an amount per share for each share of Preferred Stock held by them equal
to the sum of (i) the Liquidation Preference specified for such share of Preferred Stock and (ii) all
declared but unpaid dividends (if any) on such share of Preferred Stock. If upon the liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the assets of the Corporation legally available for
distribution to the holders of the Preferred Stock are insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of
the full amounts specified in this Section 3(a), then the entire assets of the Corporation legally available
for distribution shal! be distributed with equal priority and pro rata among the holders of the Preferred
Stock in proportion to the full amounts they would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to this
Section 3(a).

(b) Remaining Assets. After the payment or setting aside for payment to the holders
of Preferred Stock of the full amounts specified in Section 3(a) above, the entire remaining assets of the
Corporation legally available for distribution shall be distributed pro rata to holders of the Common Stock
of the Corporation in proportion to the number of shares of Common Stock held by them.

(c) Shares not Treated as Both Preferred Stock and Common Stock in any
Distribution. Shares of Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to be converted into shares of Common
Stock in order to participate in any distribution, or series of distributions pursuant to this Section 3, as
shares of Common Stock, without first foregoing participation in such distribution, or series of
distributions pursuant to this Section 3, as shares of Preferred Stock.

(d) Reorganization. For purposes of this Section 3, a liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation shall be deemed to be occasioned by and to include a “Change of
Control.” A “Change of Control” shall mean (A) a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation at law, whether voluntary or not, (B) the consummation of the merger, combination or
consolidation of the Corporation with or into any other corporation, limited liability company or other
entity (or a group of corporations, limited liability companies or other entities) (except a merger or
consolidation in which the holders of capital stock of the Corporation immediately prior to such merger or
consolidation continue to hold (solely in respect of their interests in the Corporation’s capital stock
immediately prior to such merger, combination or consolidation) a majority of the voting power of the
capital stock of the Corporation or the surviving or acquiring entity); (C) the closing of the transfer or
issuance (whether by merger, combination, consolidation or otherwise), in one transaction or a Series of

sv-fs1\14000v06 -4.
related transactions to which the Corporation is a party, to a corporation, person or group of affiliated
persons (other than an underwriter of the Corporation’s securities), of the Corporation’s securities if, after
such closing, such person or group of affiliated persons would hold 50% or more of the outstanding
voting stock of the Corporation (other than an transfer or issuance effected primarily for purposes of
raising capital for the Corporation or its subsidiaries) or (D) a sale, lease, exclusive license, assignment,
transfer or disposal of all or substantially all of the assets or intellectual property of the Corporation (other
than (1) a pledge of assets or grant of a security interest therein to a commercial lender in connection with
a commercial lending or similar transaction and (2) a sale, lease, exclusive license, assignment, transfer or
disposal to a corporation, limited liability company or other entity (or a group of corporations, limited
liability companies or other entities) in which the holders of capital stock of the Corporation immediately
prior to such sale, lease, exclusive license, assignment, transfer or disposal continue to hold (solely in
respect of their interests in the Corporation’s capital stock immediately prior to such merger, combination
or consolidation) a majority of the aggregate voting power of the capital stock of the acquiring entity or
entities)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the treatment of any particular transaction or series of related
transactions as a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation may be waived by the vote or
written consent of the holders of at least fifty-one percent (51%) of the then outstanding Preferred Stock
(voting together as a single class and on an as-converted to Common Stock basis).

(e) Valuation of Non-Cash Consideration. Jf any assets of the Corporation
distributed to stockholders in connection with any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the
Corporation are other than cash, then the value of such assets shall be their fair market value as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, except that any publicly-traded securities to be
distributed to stockholders in a liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation shall be valued
as follows:

(i) If the securities are then traded on a national securities exchange or the
Nasdaq Stock Market (or a similar national quotation system), then the value of the securities shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange or system over the ten
(10) trading day period ending five (5) trading days prior to the Distribution;

(ii) if the securities are actively traded over-the-counter, then the value of the
securities shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid prices of the securities over the ten (10)
trading day period ending five (5) trading days prior to the Distribution.

In the event of a merger or other acquisition of the Corporation by another entity, the Distribution
date shall be deemed to be the date such transaction closes.

For the purposes of this subsection 3(e), “trading day” shall mean any day which the exchange
or system on which the securities to be distributed are traded is open and “closing prices” or “closing bid
prices” shall be deemed to be: (i) for securities traded primarily on the New York Stock Exchange, the
American Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, the last reported trade price or sale price, as the case may be, at
4:00 p.m., New York time, on that day and (ii) for securities listed or traded on other exchanges, markets
and systems, the market price as of the end of the regular hours trading period that is generally accepted
as such for such exchange, market or system. If, after the date hereof, the benchmark times generally
accepted in the securities industry for determining the market price of a stock as of a given trading day
shall change from those set forth above, the fair market value shall be determined as of such other
generally accepted benchmark times. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the consideration received by the
Corporation or the proceeds to be distributed to holders of shares of the Corporation’s capital stock is
other than cash and the definitive merger agreement, asset purchase agreement or other definitive
transaction document entered into with respect to a transaction or transactions constituting a Change of
Control specifies an alternative method of determining the value of such consideration or proceeds, then,

sv-fs1\14000v06 -5-
for the purpose of this Section 3(e), the value of such consideration or proceeds shall be determined in
accordance with the method set forth in such merger agreement, asset purchase agreement or other
definitive transaction document, as applicable.

4, Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as follows
(the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the
option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share at the office of the
Corporation or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, into that number of fully-paid, nonassessable
shares of Common Stock determined by dividing the Original Issue Price for the relevant Series by the
Conversion Price for such series. (The number of shares of Common Stock into which each share of
Preferred Stock of a Series may be converted is hereinafter referred to as the “Conversion Rate” for each
such series.) Upon any decrease or increase in the Conversion Price for any Series of Preferred Stock, as
described in this Section 4, the Conversion Rate for such Series shall be appropriately increased or
decreased.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be
converted into fully-paid, non-assessable shares of Common Stock at the then effective Conversion Rate
for such share (i) immediately prior to the closing of a firm commitment underwritten initial public
offering pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the “Securities Act”), covering the offer and sale of the Corporation’s Common Stock, provided that the
offering price per share is not less than $5.00 (as appropriately adjusted for Recapitalizations) or (11) upon
the receipt by the Corporation of a written request for such conversion from the holders of at least fifty-
one percent (51%) of the Preferred Stock then outstanding, or, if later, the effective date for conversion
specified in such requests (each of the events referred to in (i) and (ii) are referred to herein as an
“Automatic Conversion Event’).

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued
upon conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would otherwise
be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the then fair market value
of a share of Common Stock as determined by the Board of Directors. For such purpose, all shares of
Preferred Stock held by each holder of Preferred Stock shall be aggregated, and any resulting fractional
share of Common Stock shall be paid in cash. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
convert the same into full shares of Common Stock, and to receive certificates therefor, he shall either
(A) surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of
any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock or (B) notify the Corporation or its transfer agent that such
certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and execute an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to
indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates, and shall give
written notice to the Corporation at such office that he elects to convert the same; provided, however, that
on the date of an Automatic Conversion Event, the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be
converted automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the
certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent; provided
further, however, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such Automatic Conversion Event unless either the certificates evidencing
such shares of Preferred Stock are delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent as provided above, or
the holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or
destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from
any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates. On the date of the occurrence of an
Automatic Conversion Event, each holder of record of shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to be the
holder of record of the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, notwithstanding that the

sv-fs1\14000v06 -6-
certificates representing such shares of Preferred Stock shall not have been surrendered at the office of the
Corporation, that notice from the Corporation shall not have been received by any holder of record of
shares of Preferred Stock, or that the certificates evidencing such shares of Common Stock shall not then
be actually delivered to such holder.

The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after such delivery, or after such agreement and
indemnification, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid
and a check payable to such holder in the amount of any cash amounts payable as the result of a
conversion into fractional shares of Common Stock, plus any declared and unpaid dividends on the
converted Preferred Stock. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the
close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the
person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be
treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date;
provided, however, that if the conversion is in connection with an underwritten offer of securities
registered pursuant to the Securities Act or a merger, sale, financing, or liquidation of the Corporation or
other event, the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering Preferred Stock for conversion, be
conditioned upon the closing of such transaction or upon the occurrence of such event, in which case the
person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of the Preferred Stock
shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such
transaction or the occurrence of such event.

(d) Adjustments to Conversion Price for Diluting Issues.

(i) Special Definition. For purposes of this paragraph 4(d), “Additional
Shares of Common” shall mean all shares of Common Stock issued (or, pursuant to paragraph 4(d)(iii),
deemed to be issued) by the Corporation after the filing of this Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, other than the issuances or deemed issuances (such issuances or deemed issuances,
“Excluded Securities”) of:

(1) shares of Common Stock and options, warrants or other rights to
purchase Common Stock issued to employees, officers or directors of, or consultant or advisors to the
Corporation or any subsidiary pursuant to restricted stock purchase agreements, stock option plans or
similar arrangements not to exceed 660,000 (as appropriately adjusted for Recapitalizations), net of any
stock repurchases or expired or terminated options pursuant to the terms of any option plan, restricted
stock purchase agreement or similar arrangement, or such greater number as may be unanimously
approved by the Board of Directors;

(2) shares of Common Stock issued upon the exercise or conversion
of Options or Convertible Securities outstanding as of the date of the filing of this Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation or upon the exercise or conversion of Options or Convertible Securities
counted against the limits set forth in subparagraph 4(d)(i)(1) above;

(3) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable as a dividend or
distribution on Preferred Stock or pursuant to any event for which adjustment is made pursuant to

paragraph 4(e), 4(f) or 4(g) hereof;

(4) shares of Common Stock issued in a registered public offering
under the Securities Act;

sv-fs1\14000v06 -7-
(5) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable pursuant to the
acquisition of another corporation by the Corporation by merger, purchase of substantially all of the assets
or other reorganization or to a joint venture agreement, provided, that such issuances are approved by the
Board of Directors (including the Preferred Directors) (as defined below));

(6) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable to banks, equipment
lessors or other financial institutions pursuant to a debt financing or commercial leasing transaction
approved by the Board of Directors (including the Preferred Directors);

(7) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable in connection with
sponsored research, collaboration, technology license, development, OEM, marketing or other similar
agreements or strategic partnerships approved by the Board of Directors (including the Preferred
Directors); and

(8) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable to suppliers or third
party service providers in connection with the provision of goods or services pursuant to transactions
approved by the Board of Directors (including the Preferred Directors);

(ii) No Adjustment of Conversion Price. No adjustment in the Conversion
Price of a particular Series of Preferred Stock shall be made in respect of the issuance of Additional
Shares of Common unless the consideration per share (as determined pursuant to paragraph 4(d)(v)) for
an Additional Share of Common issued or deemed to be issued by the Corporation is less than the
Conversion Price in effect on the date of, and immediately prior to, such issue, for such Series of
Preferred Stock.

(iii) | Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the date of the filing of this Amended and Restated
shall issue any Options or Convertible Securities or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders
of any class of securities entitled to receive any such Options or Convertible Securities, then the
maximum number of shares (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto without regard to any
provisions contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) of Common Stock issuable
upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities, the conversion or exchange of
such Convertible Securities or, in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such
Options and the conversion or exchange of the underlying securities, shall be deemed to have been issued
as of the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business
on such record date, provided that in any such case in which shares are deemed to be issued:

(1) no further adjustment in the Conversion Price of any Series of
Preferred Stock shall be made upon the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities or shares of Common
Stock in connection with the exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities;

(2) if such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms provide,
with the passage of time or otherwise, for any change in the consideration payable to the Corporation or
in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange thereof
(other than a change pursuant to the anti-dilution provisions of such Options or Convertible Securities
such as this Section 4(e) or pursuant to Recapitalization provisions of such Options or Convertible
Securities such as Sections 4(e), 4(f) and 4(g) hereof), the Conversion Price of each Series of Preferred
Stock and any subsequent adjustments based thereon shall be recomputed to reflect such change as if such
change had been in effect as of the original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of the record date with
respect thereto);

sv-fs1\14000v06 -8-
(3) no readjustment pursuant to clause (2) above shall have the
effect of increasing the Conversion Price of a Series of Preferred Stock to an amount above the
Conversion Price that would have resulted from any other issuances of Additional Shares of Common and
any other adjustments provided for herein between the original adjustment date and such readjustment
date;

(4) upon the expiration of any such Options or any rights of
conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have been exercised, the
Conversion Price of each Series of Preferred Stock computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon the
occurrence of a record date with respect thereto) and any subsequent adjustments based thereon shall,
upon such expiration, be recomputed as if:

(a) in the case of Convertible Securities or Options for
Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common issued were the shares of Common Stock, if any,
actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities and the consideration received therefor was the consideration actually received by the
Corporation for the issue of such exercised Options plus the consideration actually received by the
Corporation upon such exercise or for the issue of all such Convertible Securities which were actually
converted or exchanged, plus the additional consideration, if any, actually received by the Corporation
upon such conversion or exchange, and

{b) in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, only
the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were issued at the time of
issue of such Options, and the consideration received by the Corporation for the Additional Shares of
Common deemed to have been then issued was the consideration actually received by the Corporation for
the issue of such exercised Options, plus the consideration deemed to have been received by the
Corporation (determined pursuant to Section 4(d)(v)) upon the issue of the Convertible Securities with
respect to which such Options were actually exercised; and

(5) if such record date shall have been fixed and such Options or
Convertible Securities are not issued on the date fixed therefor, the adjustment previously made in the
Conversion Price which became effective on such record date shall be canceled as of the close of business
on such record date, and thereafter the Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this
paragraph 4(d)(iii) as of the actual date of their issuance.

(iv) | Adjustment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional Shares of
Common. In the event this Corporation shall issue Additional Shares of Common (including Additional
Shares of Common deemed to be issued pursuant to paragraph 4(d)(iii)) without consideration or for a
consideration per share less than the applicable Conversion Price of a Series of Preferred Stock in effect
on the date of and immediately prior to such issue, then, the Conversion Price of the affected Series of
Preferred Stock shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest cent)
determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of
shares which the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for the total number of Additional
Shares of Common so issued would purchase at such Conversion Price, and the denominator of which
shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the
number of such Additional Shares of Common so issued. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Conversion
Price shall not be reduced at such time if the amount of such reduction would be less than $0.01, but any
such amount shall be carried forward, and a reduction will be made with respect to such amount at the
time of, and together with, any subsequent reduction which, together with such amount and any other
amounts so carried forward, equal $0.01 or more in the aggregate. For the purposes of this

sv-fs1\E4000v06 -9-
Subsection 4(d)(iv), all shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock and the exercise and/or conversion of any other outstanding Convertible Securities and all
outstanding Options shall be deemed to be outstanding.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this subsection 4(d),
the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue (or deemed issue) of any Additional Shares of
Common shall be computed as follows:

Q) Cash and Property. Such consideration shall:

{a) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
aggregate amount of cash received by the Corporation before deducting any reasonable discounts,
commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the Corporation for any underwriting or
otherwise in connection with such issuance;

(b) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair market value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors; and

{c) in the event Additional Shares of Common are issued
together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for consideration which covers
both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in clauses (a) and (b)
above, as reasonably determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(2) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per share
received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common deemed to have been issued pursuant to
paragraph 4(d)(iii) shall be determined by dividing:

(x) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the
Corporation as consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the minimum
aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without
regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration) payable to
the Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options for
Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities by

(y) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as
set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a
subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities.

(e) Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of Common Stock. In the event
the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided (by stock split, by payment of a stock
dividend or otherwise), into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price of each
Series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall, concurrently with the
effectiveness of such subdivision, be proportionately decreased. In the event the outstanding shares of
Common Stock shall be combined (by reclassification or otherwise) into a lesser number of shares of
Common Stock, the Conversion Prices in effect immediately prior to such combination shall,
concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination, be proportionately increased.

sv-fs1\t4000v06 -10-
(f) Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of Preferred Stock. In the event
the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock or a Series of Preferred Stock shall be subdivided (by stock
split, by payment of a stock dividend or otherwise), into a greater number of shares of Preferred Stock,
the Dividend Rate, Original Issue Price and Liquidation Preference of the affected Series of Preferred
Stock in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such
subdivision, be proportionately decreased. In the event the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock or a
Series of Preferred Stock shall be combined (by reclassification or otherwise) into a lesser number of
shares of Preferred Stock, the Dividend Rate, Original Issue Price and Liquidation Preference of the
affected Series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such combination shall, concurrently
with the effectiveness of such combination, be proportionately increased.

(g) Adjustments for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. Subject to
Section 3 above (“Liquidation Rights”), if the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred
Stock shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock,
whether by capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination
of shares provided for above), then, in any such event, in lieu of the number of shares of Common Stock
which the holders would otherwise have been entitled to receive each holder of such Preferred Stock shall
have the right thereafter to convert such shares of Preferred Stock into a number of shares of such other
class or classes of stock which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon
conversion of such Series of Preferred Stock immediately before that change would have been entitled to
receive in such reorganization or reclassification, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein with
respect to such other shares.

(h) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation at its expense shall
promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to
each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in
detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon the
written request at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such
holder a like certificate setting forth (1) such adjustments and readjustments, (11) the Conversion Price at
the time in effect and (iii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other
property which at the time would be received upon the conversion of Preferred Stock.

(i) Waiver of Adjustment of Conversion Price. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, any downward adjustment of the Conversion Price of any Series of Preferred Stock may be
waived by the consent or vote of the holders of at least fifty-one percent (51%) of the outstanding shares
of such Series either before or after the issuance causing the adjustment.

(j) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at all
times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock solely for the
purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock, such number of its shares of
Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding
shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common
Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock,
the Corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to
increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shail be
sufficient for such purpose.

5. Voting.

(a) Restricted Class Voting. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or as
required by law, the holders of Preferred Stock and the holders of Common Stock shall vote together and
not as separate classes.

(b) No Series Voting. Other than as provided herein or required by law, there shall
be no Series voting.

(c) Preferred Stock. Each holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to the number
of votes equal to the number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Preferred Stock held by
such holder could be converted as of the record date. The holders of shares of the Preferred Stock shall
be entitled to vote on all matters on which the Common Stock shall be entitled to vote. Holders of
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to notice of any stockholders’ meeting in accordance with the Bylaws of
the Corporation. Fractional votes shall not, however, be permitted and any fractional voting rights
resulting from the above formula (after aggregating all shares into which shares of Preferred Stock held
by each holder could be converted), shall be disregarded.

(d) Election of Directors. The Board of Directors shall consist of five authorized
members. So long as at least 150,000 shares (as appropriately adjusted for Recapitalizations) of Preferred
Stock remain outstanding, the holders of Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, shall be entitled to
elect two (2) members of the Corporation’s Board of Directors (such directors, the “Preferred
Directors”) at each meeting or pursuant to each consent of the Corporation’s stockholders for the election
of directors. The holders of Common Stock, voting as a separate class, shall be entitled to elect one
member of the Corporation’s Board of Directors at each meeting or pursuant to each consent of the
Corporation’s stockholders for the election of directors (such directors, the “Common Director’). Any
additional members of the Corporation’s Board of Directors shall be elected by the holders of Common
Stock and Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class, If a vacancy on the Board of Directors is to
be filled by the Board of Directors, only directors elected by the same class or classes of stockholders as
those who would be entitled to vote to fill such vacancy shall vote to fill such vacancy.

(e) Adjustment in Authorized Common Stock. The number of authorized shares of
Common Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares of Common Stock
then outstanding) by an affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock of the Corporation.

(f) Common Stock. Each holder of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to one
vote for each share thereof held.

6. Redemption.

(a) At any time after the fifth anniversary of the Original Issue Date, and at the
election of the holders of at least fifty-one percent (51%) of the then outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred, this Corporation shall redeem, out of funds legally available therefor, all (but not less than all)
outstanding shares of Series A Preferred which have not been converted into Common Stock pursuant to
Section 4 hereof, in three (3) equal annual installments (each a “Redemption Date”). The Corporation
shall redeem the shares of Series A Preferred by paying in cash an amount per share equal to the Original
Issue Price for such Series A Preferred, plus an amount equal to all declared and unpaid dividends thereon
(the “Redemption Price”). The number of shares of Series A Preferred that the Corporation shall be
required under this Section 6 to redeem on any one (1) Redemption Date shall be equal to the amount
determined by dividing: (a)the aggregate number of shares of Series A Preferred outstanding
immediately prior to the Redemption Date by (b) the number of remaining Redemption Dates (including

sv-fs1\14000v06 -12-
the Redemption Date to which such calculation applies). If the funds legally available for redemption of
the Series A Preferred shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full respective
Redemption Prices, the Corporation shall effect such redemption pro rata among the holders of the
Series A Preferred so that each holder of Series A Preferred shall receive a redemption payment equal to a
fraction of the aggregate amount available for redemption, the numerator of which is the number of shares
of Series A Preferred held by such holder with each number multiplied by the Redemption Price of each
share of Series A Preferred held by such holder, and the denominator of which is the number of shares of
Series A Preferred outstanding multiplied by the Redemption Price of each such outstanding share of
Series A Preferred.

(b) Any redemption effected pursuant to Section 6(a) shall be made on a pro rata
basis among the holders of the Series A Preferred in proportion to the shares of Series A Preferred then
held by them.

(c) At least fifteen (15), but no more than thirty (30) days prior to each Redemption
Date, written notice shall be mailed, first class postage prepaid, to each holder of record (at the close of
business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given) of the Preferred Stock to be
redeemed, at the address last shown on the records of the Corporation for such holder, notifying such
holder of the redemption to be effected, specifying the number of shares to be redeemed from such
holder, the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price, the place at which payment may be obtained and
calling upon such holder to surrender to the Corporation, in the manner and at the place designated, the
holder’s certificate or certificates representing the shares to be redeemed (the “Redemption Notice”).
Except as provided herein, on or after the Redemption Date each holder of Preferred Stock to be
redeemed shall surrender to this Corporation the certificate or certificates representing such shares, in the
manner and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice, and thereupon the Redemption Price of
such shares shall be payable to the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or
certificates as the owner thereof and each surrendered certificate shall be cancelled. In the event less than
all the shares represented by any such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued
representing the unredeemed shares.

(d) From and after the applicable Redemption Date, unless there shall have been a
default in payment of the Redemption Price, all rights of the holders of shares of Preferred Stock
designated for redemption in the Redemption Notice as holders of Preferred Stock (except the right to
receive the Redemption Price upon surrender of their certificate or certificates) shall cease with respect to
the shares designated for redemption on such date, and such shares shall not thereafter be transferred on
the books of the Corporation or be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose whatsoever. If the funds of
the Corporation legally available for redemption of shares of Preferred Stock on any Redemption Date are
insufficient to redeem the total number of shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such date, those
funds which are legally available will be used to redeem the maximum possible number of such shares
ratably among the holders of such shares to be redeemed based upon their holdings of Preferred Stock.
The unpaid amount of any past due Redemption Amount shall accrue interest at a rate of one (1) percent
per month until paid. The shares of Preferred Stock not redeemed shall remain outstanding and entitled to
all the rights and preferences provided herein. At any time thereafter when additional funds of the
Corporation are legally available for the redemption of shares of Preferred Stock such funds will
immediately be used to redeem the balance of the shares which the Corporation has become obliged to
redeem on any Redemption Date, but which it has not redeemed.

(e) On or prior to each Redemption Date, the Corporation may deposit the
Redemption Price of all shares of Preferred Stock designated for redemption in the Redemption Notice
and not yet redeemed with a bank or trust corporation having aggregate capital and surplus in excess of
$100,000,000, as a trust fund for the benefit of the respective holders of the shares designated for

sv-fst\14000v06 -13-
redemption and not yet redeemed, with irrevocable instructions and authority to the bank or trust
corporation to pay the Redemption Price for such shares to their respective holders on or after the
Redemption Date upon receipt of notification from the Corporation that such holder has surrendered a
share certificate to the Corporation pursuant to Section 6(c) above. As of the Redemption Date, the
deposit shall constitute full payment of the shares to their holders, and from and after the Redemption
Date the shares so called for redemption shall be redeemed and shall be deemed to be no longer
outstanding, and the holders thereof shall cease to be stockholders with respect to such shares and shall
have no rights with respect thereto except the right to receive from the bank or trust corporation payment
of the Redemption Price of the shares, without interest, upon surrender of their certificates therefor. Such
instructions shall also provide that any moneys deposited by the Corporation pursuant to this Section 6(e)
for the redemption of shares thereafter converted into shares of the Corporation’s Common Stock
pursuant to Section 4 hereof prior to the Redemption Date shall be returned to the Corporation forthwith
upon such conversion. The balance of any moneys deposited by the Corporation pursuant to this
Section 6(e) remaining unclaimed at the expiration of two (2) years following the Redemption Date shall
thereafter be returned to the Corporation upon its request expressed in a resolution of its Board of
Directors.

7. Amendments and Changes. As long as 150,000 shares of the Preferred Stock shall be

least fifty-one percent (51%) of the then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock:
