The relative rights, preferences, privileges, limitations and restrictions granted to or
imposed on the respective classes and series of the shares of capital stock or the holders thereof
are as follows:

4.1 Dividends. The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
receive dividends, when, as and if declared by a majority of the Corporation’s Board of
Directors, out of any assets legally available therefor, prior and in preference to any declaration
or payment of any dividend on the Corporation’s Common Stock or any other class or series of
stock (payable other than in Common Stock or other securities or rights convertible into, or
entitling the holder thereof to receive directly or indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock
(“Common Stock Equivalents”)) at the rate of $63.892 per share (as adjusted for any stock
dividend, stock split or combination with respect to such share)-per-annum. The right to receive
dividends on shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall not be cumulative, and no right to such
dividends shall accrue to holders of Series A Preferred Stock by reason-of the fact that dividends
on such shares are not declared or paid in any year. Upon conversion of any share of Series A
Preferred Stock pursuant to subsection (A) or (B) of Section 4.3, all dividends declared but
unpaid on such share at the time of conversion shall be paid in cash or shares of Common Stock
at the option of a majority of the Corporation’s Board of Directors at the then fair market value
as determined in good faith by a majority of the Corporation’s Board of Directors. Except as
permitted in this Section 4.1, no dividends shall be declared or paid, and no distribution shall be
made, on any shares of Common Stock or any other class or series of stock (other than a
dividend payable solely in shares of Common Stock) unless (A) a dividend in an amount equal to
the dividend described in the first sentence of this Section 4.1, together with any dividends
previously declared but unpaid, is paid or set aside for payment on each outstanding share of
Series A Preferred Stock and (B) any additional dividends declared or paid in any year are
declared or paid among the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and Common Stock then
outstanding based on the number of shares of Common Stock held by each such holder
(assuming full conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock).

4.2 Liquidation Preference.

(A) Preferred Stock Preference. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation, either voluntary or involuntary, the holders of each share of
Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any distribution of
any of the Corporation’s assets or funds to the holders of the Corporation’s Common Stock or
any other capital stock of the Corporation ranking-junior-to Series A Preferred Stock by
reason of their ownership thereof, an amount equalie $1197975 ber share (as adjusted for any
stock dividend, stock split or combination with respett.to_such-share after the date upon which
this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (this “Restated Certificate”) is filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the “Filing Date”)) (the “Liquidation Price”) plus
an additional amount equal to any dividends declared but unpaid on each such share. If, upon
such liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the assets and funds distributed are insufficient to
permit the payment to each holder of Series A Preferred Stock of the full aforesaid preferential
amount, the entire assets and funds legally available for distribution shall be distributed ratably
among the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock based on the number of shares of Series A
Preferred Stock held by each such holder.

NY:1063210v5 -2-
(B) Remaining Assets. Upon the completion of the distribution required by
subsection (A) of this Section 4.2, the Corporation’s remaining assets-or-finds- available for
distribution to stockholders shall be distributed ratably io the holders of Series A Preferred Stock
and Common Stock based on the number of shares of Common Stock héld-by-each such holder
(assuming full conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock).

(C) (1) Unless otherwise determined by the holders of at least two-thirds
(2/3) of the Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding, for the purposes of this Section 4.2, a
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation shall be deemed to include (X) the
acquisition of the Corporation by another entity by means of any transaction or series of related
transactions (including, without limitation, any merger, consolidation or other form of
reorganization in which outstanding shares of the Corporation are exchanged for securities or
other consideration issued, or caused to be issued, by the acquiring entity or its subsidiary) (each,
a “Merger Transaction”) that results in the transfer or acquisition of at least a majority of the
Corporation’s voting power, (Y) a Merger Transaction, unless the Corporation’s stockholders of
record as constituted immediately prior to such Merger Transaction will, immediately after such
Merger Transaction hold at least a majority of the voting power of the surviving or acquiring
entity in the same relative proportions, or (Z) a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Corporation or the exclusive license of all or substantially all of the Corporation’s intellectual
property by means of any transaction or series of related transactions (collectively, a ‘Deemed
Liquidation”).

(2) If any assets of the Corporation distributed to stockholders in
connection with any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation are other than
cash, then the value of such assets shall be their fair market value as mutually determined in
good faith by a majority of the Corporation’s Board of Directors and the holders of at least two-
thirds of the shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding; provided, however, any publicly-traded
securities shall be valued as follows:

(a) If the securities are then traded on a national securities
exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market (or a similar national quotation system), then the value of
the securities shall be deemed to be to the average of the closing prices of the securities on such
exchange or system over the ten (10) trading day period ending five (5) trading days prior to the
distribution; and

(b) If the securities are actively traded over-the-counter, then
the value of the securities shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid prices of the

securities over the ten (10) trading day period ending five (5) trading days prior to the
distribution.

(3) In the event the requirements of this subsection (C) are not
complied with, the Corporation shall forthwith either:

(a) Cause such closing to be postponed until such time as the
requirements of this Section 4.2 have been complied with, or

NY:1063210v5 -3-
(b) Cancel such transaction, in which event the rmghts,
preferences, privileges and restrictions of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall revert
to and be the same as such rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions existing immediately
prior to the date of the first notice referred to in subsection (C)(4).

(4) The Corporation shall give each holder of record of Series A
Preferred Stock written notice of a transaction described in subsection (C)(1) not later than
twenty (20) days prior to the stockholders’ meeting called to approve such transaction, or twenty
(20) days prior to the closing of such transaction, whichever is earlier, and shall also notify such
holders in writing of the final approval of such transaction. The first of such notices shall
describe the material terms and conditions of the impending transaction and the provisions of this
Section 4.2, and the Corporation shall thereafter give such holders prompt notice of any material
changes. The transaction shall in no event take place sooner than twenty (20) days after the
Corporation has given the first notice provided for herein or sooner than ten (10) days after the
Corporation has given notice of any material changes provided for herein; provided, however,
that such periods may be shortened upon the written consent of the holders of at least two-thirds
(2/3) of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding.

4.3 Conversion. The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock have conversion rights
as follows:

(A) Right to Convert. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be
convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such
share, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is
determined by dividing $798.65, the “Original Issue Price” for the Series A Preferred Stock by
the Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred Stock, determined as hereinafter provided, in
effect at the time of the conversion (the “Conversion Rate’). The initial “Conversion Price” per
share for the Series A Preferred Stock shall be $798.65. Such initial Conversion Price shall be
subject to adjustment as provided in subsection (D) of this Section 4.3.

(B) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall
automatically be converted into fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock at its then
effective Conversion Rate upon the earlier to occur of (i) immediately prior to the closing of a
firm commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement on
Form S-1 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), covering the offer
and sale of Common Stock to the public for the account of the Corporation or (ii) the date upon
which the holders of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred
Stock elect to convert their shares of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4.3.

(C) Mechanics of Conversion.

(1) Before any holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
convert the same into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the certificate or
certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for
such Series A Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the Corporation at such office that
such holder elects to convert the same and shall state therein the name or names in which such
holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued. The

NY:10632!10v5 -4.
Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such
holder of Series A Preferred Stock, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of
Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid. Such conversion shall be
deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of surrender of
the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to
receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all
purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date;
provided, however, that in the event of an automatic conversion pursuant to Section 4.3(B)
hereof, the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically
without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates
representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent; provided
further, however, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such automatic conversion unless the certificates
evidencing such shares of Series A Preferred Stock are either delivered to the Corporation or its
transfer agent as provided above.

(2) If the conversion is in connection with an underwritten offering of
securities pursuant to the Securities Act, the conversion may, at the option of any holder
tendering shares of Series A Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing
with the underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering, in which event the
person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock
shall not be deemed to have converted such Series A Preferred Stock until immediately prior to
the closing of such sale of securities.

(D) Adjustment of Conversion Price. Unless otherwise determined by the
holders of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding, the
Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to
time as follows:

(1) (a) If the Corporation-shalligsue,_after the Filing Date, any
Additional Stock (as defined in subsection ()2)) without considerati6nr or-for-a-consideratton ,
per share Jess than the Conversion Price in effect_immediately prior to the issuance of-such
Additional Stock, the Conversion Price in effect immediately peor 1 Cah Such issuance of
Additional Stock shall forthwith (except as otherwise provided in this subsection (D)) be
adjusted to a price equal to (calculated to the nearest cent) the product obtained by multiply

_~the.Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance of Additional Secty f

fraction, thé numerator of which is equal to the sum of (x) the total number of shares of Commi
Stock.outStanding (including any shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to
subsection (D)(1)(e)(i) or (ii) of this Section 4.3) immediately prior to such issuance of
Additional Stock plus (y) the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate
consideration received by this Corporation for such issuance of Additional Stock would purchase
at the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance of Additional Stock, and the
denominator of which is equal to the sum of (x) the total number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding (including any shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to subsection
(D)(1)(e)(i) or (ii) of this Section 4.3) immediately prior to such issuance of Additional Stock
plus (y) the number of shares of Additional Stock issued.

NY:1063210v5 -5-
(b) No adjustment in the Conversion Price need be made if
such adjustment would result in a change in the Conversion Price of less than $0.01. Any
adjustment of less than $0.01 that is not made shall be carried forward and shall be made at the
time of and together with any subsequent adjustment that, on a cumulative basis, amounts to an
adjustment of $0.01 or more in the Conversion Price. Except to the limited extent provided for
in subsections (D)(1)(e)(iii) or (iv), no adjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this
subsection (D)(1) shall have the effect of increasing such Conversion Price above the Conversion
Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment.

(c) In the case of the issuance of Additional Stock for cash, the
consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting any
discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the Corporation for any
underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

(d) In the case of the issuance of Additional Stock for a
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be
deemed to be the fair value thereof as determined in good faith by a majority of the
Corporation’s Board of Directors (including each of the Preferred Directors (as such term is
defined in Section 4.5(C)) irrespective of any accounting treatment.

(e) In the case of the issuance (whether before, on or after the
Filing Date) of (i) options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common Stock, (ii) securities by
their terms convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock or (iii) options to purchase or
rights to subscribe for securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for Common
Stock, the following provisions shall apply for all purposes of subsections (D)(1) and (2):

(i) The aggregate maximum number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable upon exercise (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to
exercisability, including without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account
potential antidilution adjustments) of such options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common
Stock shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such options or rights were issued and for
a consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in subsections
(D)(1)(c) and (D)(1)(d)), if any, received by the Corporation upon the issuance of such options or
rights plus the minimum exercise price provided in such options or rights (without taking into
account potential antidilution adjustments) for the Common Stock covered thereby.

(ii) The aggregate maximum number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of or in exchange (assuming the satisfaction of any
conditions to convertibility or exchangeability, including without limitation, the passage of time,
but without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) for any such convertible or
exchangeable securities or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for
such convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof shall
be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or such options or rights
were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration, if any, received by the
Corporation for any such securities and related options or rights (excluding any cash received on
account of accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the minimum additional consideration, if
any, to be received by the Corporation (without taking into account potential antidilution

NY:1063210v5 -6-
adjustments) upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or the exercise of any related
options or rights (the consideration in each case to be determined in the manner provided in
subsections (D)(1)(c) and (D)(1)(d)).

(iii) ‘In the event of any change in the number of shares
of Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon exercise
of such options or rights or upon conversion of or exchange for such convertible or exchangeable
securities, including, but not limited to, a change resulting from the antidilution provisions
thereof, the Conversion Price, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such
options, rights or securities, shall be recomputed to reflect such change, but no further
adjustment shall be made for the actual issuance of Common Stock or any payment of such

consideration upon the exercise of any such options or rights or the conversion or exchange of
such securities.

(iv) Upon the expiration of any such options or rights,
the termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options or
rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Conversion Price, to the extent
in any way affected by or computed using such options, rights or securities or options or rights
related to such securities, shall be recomputed to reflect the issuance of only the number of
shares of Common Stock (and convertible or exchangeable securities that remain in effect)
actually issued upon the exercise of such options or rights, upon the conversion or exchange of
such securities or upon the exercise of the options or rights related to such securities.

(v) | The number of shares of Common Stock deemed
issued and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to subsections (D)(1)(e){i) and (ii)
shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or expiration of the type
described in either subsection (D)(1)(e)(iii) or (iv).

(2) ‘Additional Stock” shall mean any shares of Common Stock
issued (or deemed to have been issued pursuant to subsection (D)(1)(e) of this Section 4.3) by
the Corporation after the Filing Date other than:

(a) Shares of Common Stock issued or issuable upon
conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, or as dividends or distributions on the Series A
Preferred Stock; or

(b) Shares of Common Stock issued to the Corporation’s
employees, officers, directors, consultants, advisors or services providers pursuant to and in
accordance with Company’s Performance Recognition Plan,

(3) Subdivision, etc. In the event the Corporation should at any time
or from time to time after the Filing Date, fix a record date for the effectuation of a split or
subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or the determination of holders of
Common Stock entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of
Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents without payment of any consideration by such
holder for the additional shares of Common Stock or the Common Stock Equivalents (including
the additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof), then, as of

NY:1063210v5 -7-
such record date (or the date of such dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no record date
is fixed), the Conversion Price shall be proportionately decreased.

(4) Combination. If the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding at any time after the Filing Date is decreased by a combination of the outstanding
shares of Common Stock, then, on the effective date of such combination, the Conversion Price
shall be proportionately increased.

(E) Other Distributions. In the event the Corporation shall declare a
distnbution payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by the
Corporation or other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred
to in subsection (D3) of this Section 4.3, then, in each such case for the purpose of this
subsection (E), the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a proportionate share
of any such distribution as though they were the holders of the number of shares of Common
Stock of the Corporation into which their respective shares of Series A Preferred Stock are
convertible as of the record date fixed for the determination of the holders of Common Stock of
the Corporation entitled to receive such distribution.

(F)  Recapitalizations. If, at any time or from time to time after the Filing
Date, there shall be a recapitalization of the Corporation’s Common Stock (other than (x) a
subdivision or combination provided for in subsections (D)(3) or (D)(4) of this Section 4.3 or (y)
a Deemed Liquidation as defined in Section 4.2(C)) provision shall be made so that the holders
of Series A Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of Series A
Preferred Stock the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the Corporation
or otherwise, to which a holder of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of Series A
Preferred Stock would have been entitled on such recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate
adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 4.3 with respect to
the rights of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock after the recapitalization to the end that
the provisions of this Section 4.3 (including adjustment of the Conversion Price then in effect
and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock) shall be
applicable after that event as nearly equivalent as prior to that event as may be practicable.

(G) NoImpairment. The Corporation will not, by amendment of its Certificate
of Incorporation or through any reorganization, recapitalization, transfer of assets, consolidation,
merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to
avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder
by the Corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the
provisions of this Section 4.3 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or
appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holders of the Series A Preferred
Stock set forth in this Section 4.3 against impairment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any action
taken with the requisite stockholder consent pursuant to the terms of the Certificate of
Incorporation or the DGCL shall not be deemed to be an impairment.

(H) Certificate as to Adjustment. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Conversion Rate pursuant to this Section 4.3, the Corporation, at its expense,
shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and
prepare and furnish to each holder of Series A Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such

NY:1063210v5 -8-
adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or
readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon written request at any time of any holder of
Serics A Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting
forth (i) all such adjustments and readjustments, (ii) the Conversion Rate at the time in effect,
and (iii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property that at
the time would be received upon the conversion of such holder’s shares of Series A Preferred
Stock.

(I) Notices of Record Date. In the event of any taking by the Corporation of a
record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof
who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend) or other distribution, any
right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of stock of any class or any other
securities or property or to receive any other right, the Corporation shall mail to each holder of
Series A Preferred Stock at least fifteen (15) business days prior to such record date, a notice
specifying the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend or
distnbution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right.

(J) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at
all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock
solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock such
number of its shares of Common Stock as shal! from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number
of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take
such corporate action as may, based upon advice of its counsel, be necessary to increase its
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient
for such purpose, including, without limitation, engaging its best efforts to obtain the requisite
stockholder approval for any necessary amendment to this Restated Certificate.

4.4 Redemption.

(A) Right to Redemption. Upon receipt of a written request from the holders
of not less than a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock (the
“Redemption Request”), at any time after fifth (5"") anniversary of the date on which the
Corporation first issues shares of its Series A Preferred Stock (the “Series A Original Issue
Date”’) the Corporation shall redeem all of the Preferred Stock then outstanding in three (3) equal
annual installments, (each installment or payment date, a “Redemption Date”). The Corporation
shall on each such Redemption Date redeem up to the maximum amount the Corporation may
lawfully redeem out of funds legally available therefore. The “Redemption Price” shal] mean an
amount per share equal to the lesser of (i) the Original Issue Price plus an additional amount
equal to any dividends declared but unpaid on each such share or (ii) the then current fair market
value of such share.

(B) Redemption Procedure. Within fifteen (15) days of the receipt by the
Corporation of the Redemption Request, the Corporation shall mail, first class postage prepaid,
written notice (the “Notice of Redemption”) to each holder of record (at the close of business on
the business day preceding the day on which notice is given) of Series A Preferred Stock, at the

NY:1063210v5 -9-
address last shown on the records of the Corporation for such holder or given by the holder to the
Corporation, for the purpose of notifying such holder of the redemption to be effected. The
Notice of Redemption shall specify the Redemption Date which shall be between fifteen (15) and
thirty (30) days after the mailing of the Notice of Redemption on which the Series A Preferred
Stock then outstanding shall be redeemed and the place at which payment shall be made, which
shall be the principal offices of the Corporation or such other place as shall be mutually
agreeable to the Corporation and holders of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the shares of Series A
Preferred Stock then outstanding. The Notice of Redemption shall call upon each holder. of
Series A Preferred Stock to either (i) surrender to the Corporation, in the manner and at the place
designated, such holder’s certificate or certificates representing the shares to be redeemed or
(ii) convert such Series A Preferred Stock into Common Stock prior to the Redemption Date in
accordance with the provisions of Section 4.3 above. Subject to Section 4.4(C), on the
Redemption Date, the Corporation shall pay the Redemption Price in cash or by check to the
order of the person whose name appears on the certificate or certificates of the Series A Preferred
Stock that (i) shall not have been converted pursuant to Section 4.3 hereof and (ii) shall have
been surrendered to the Corporation in the manner and at the place designated in the Notice of
Redemption and thereupon each surrendered certificate shall be canceled.

(C) Effect of Redemption. From and after each Redemption Date, unless there
shall have been a default in payment of the Redemption Price, all rights of the holders of the
shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed on a Redemption Date (except the right to
receive their respective Redemption Price without interest upon surrender of their certificate or
certificates) shall cease with respect to such shares, and such shares shall not thereafter be
transferred on the books of the Corporation or be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose
whatsoever. If the funds of the Corporation legally available for redemption on any Redemption
Date are insufficient to redeem the total number of shares requested to be redeemed on such date,
those funds which are legally available will be used to redeem the maximum possible number of
such shares ratably among the holders of such shares to be redeemed based upon their holdings
of Preferred Stock. The shares not redeemed shall remain outstanding and be entitled to all the
rights and preferences provided herein. At any time thereafter when additional funds of the
Corporation are legally available for the redemption of shares not redeemed, such funds will
immediately be set aside for the redemption of the balance of the shares which the Corporation
has become obligated to redeem on any Redemption Date but which it has not redeemed.

(D) Redemption Default. In addition to the provisions of Section 4.4(C), if
this Corporation fails to redeem the total number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock required
to be redeemed on any Redemption Date, or if the funds of this Corporation legally available for
redemption of Series A Preferred Stock on any Redemption Date are insufficient to redeem the
total number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock required to be redeemed on such date, then
the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors will, at the request of the holders of at
least two-thirds (2/3) of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding, be increased by
one member, and the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock will have the special right,
voting separately as a single class or series (with each share being entitled to one vote), and to
the exclusion of all other classes or series of this Corporation’s voting stock, to elect an
individual to fill such newly created directorship, to fill any vacancy of such directorship and to
remove any individual elected to such directorship. The newly created directorship will
constitute a separate class of directors, and the director elected by the holders of Series A

NY:1063210v5 -10-
Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4.4(D) will be entitled to cast a number of votes on each
matter considered by the Board of Directors equal to the sum of the number of votes entitled to
be cast by all of the other then serving directors plus one (1). This special right of the holders of
Series A Preferred Stock to elect a member of the Board of Directors pursuant to this Section
4.4(D) may be exercised at a special meeting called pursuant to this Section 4.4(D), at any
annual or any other special meeting of the stockholders and, to the extent and in the manner
permitted by applicable law, pursuant to a written consent in lieu of a meeting of the
stockholders. This special right of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall terminate

when all shares of the Series A Preferred Stock have been redeemed and paid in full by the
Corporation.

45 Voting.

(A) General. Each holder of outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of whole shares of Common Stock
into which the shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by such holder are then convertible (as
