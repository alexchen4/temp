The preferences, voting powers, qualifications and special or relative rights or privileges
of the Common Stock and the Preferred Stock are as follows:

A. COMMON STOCK

1. General. The voting, dividend and liquidation rights of the holders of the
Common Stock are subject to and qualified by the nghts, powers and preferences of the holders
of the Preferred Stock set forth herein and as may be designated by resolution of the Board of
Directors with respect to any series of Preferred Stock as authorized herein.

2. Voting. Except as otherwise required by law or this Certificate of Incorporation,
the holders of Common Stock will be entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be voted by
the stockholders of the Corporation. The number of authorized shares of Common Stock may be
increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the
affirmative vote of the holders of shares of stock of the Corporation representing a majority of
the votes represented by all outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote,
irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the General Corporation Law.

B. PREFERRED STOCK
1. Dividends.

The holders of shares of Series B Preferred shall be entitled to receive cumulative
dividends in preference to holders of Series A Preferred and Common Stock, if and when
declared by the Board of Directors from funds that are legally available therefor, at the rate of
$.125232 per share per annum, which dividends shall accrue daily in arrears, whether or not such
dividends are declared by the Board of Directors (which amount shall be subject to equitable
adjustment whenever there shall occur a stock split, stock dividend, distribution, combination of
shares, reclassification of shares, recapitalization or other similar event). Such dividends shall be
paid in cash if and when determined by the Board of Directors, but in any event (i) upon
liquidation or redemption of the Series B Preferred as set forth in Subsection 2(a) and Section 6
below or (ii) upon a Deemed Liquidation Event as set forth in Subsection 2(c). The Corporation
shall not declare, pay or set aside any dividends on any shares of capital stock of the Corporation
(other than dividends on shares of Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock or
dividends on shares of Series A Preferred payable in shares of Series A Preferred) unless the
holders of Series B Preferred then outstanding shall first receive a dividend on each outstanding
share of Series B Preferred in an amount at least equal to the amount described in the preceding
sentence (the “Series B Dividend”). The Corporation shall not declare, pay or set aside any
dividends on any other shares of capital stock of the Corporation (other than the Series B
Dividend and other than dividends on shares of Common Stock payable in shares of Common
Stock) unless the holders of the Preferred Stock then outstanding shall first receive, or
simultaneously receive, a dividend on each outstanding share of each series of Preferred Stock in
an amount at least equal to that dividend per share of the applicable series of Preferred Stock as
would equal the product of (1) the dividend payable on each share of such class or series
determined, if applicable, as if all such shares of such class or series had been converted into
Common Stock and (2) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of a
share of the applicable series of Preferred Stock, in each case calculated on the record date for
determination of holders entitled to receive such dividend. Notwithstanding the forgoing,
payment of any dividend on capital stock of the Corporation is subject to Subsection 3(c)(iii).

2. Liquidation, Dissolution or _Winding-Up; Certain Mergers, Consolidations and
Asset Sales.

(a) Preferential Payments to Holders of Preferred Stock. In the event of any voluntary or

involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation (including a Deemed
Liquidation Event as defined below), the holders of shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding
shall be entitled to be paid out of the assets available for distribution to its stockholders, and
before any payment shall be made to the holders of Common Stock or any other class or series of
stock, by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount per share equal to the original purchase
price per share (such amount, as so adjusted from time to time, being hereinafter referred to as
the “Original Issue Price’) for each share of Preferred Stock as follows: (i) $1.3216 per share
with respect to the Series A Preferred and (ii) $1.5654 per share with respect to the Series B
Preferred, in each case subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend,
stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization affecting such shares, plus, in each case,
any dividends accrued or declared but unpaid thereon. If upon any such liquidation, dissolution
or winding-up of the Corporation the assets or surplus funds available for distribution to its
stockholders shall be insufficient to pay the holders of shares of Preferred Stock their full
preferential amount, the holders of shares of Preferred Stock shall share ratably in any
distribution of the assets available for distribution on a pari passu basis in proportion to the
respective amounts which would otherwise be payable in respect of the shares held by them upon
such distribution if all amounts payable on or with respect to such shares were paid in full.

(b) Distribution of Remaining Assets. In the event of any voluntary or involuntary
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation (including a Deemed Liquidation
Event), after the payment of all preferential amounts required to be paid to the holders of shares
of Preferred Stock, the remaining assets available for distribution to the Corporation's
stockholders shall be distributed among the holders of the shares of Preferred Stock, Common
Stock and any other series of capital stock entitled pursuant to the terms of this Certificate of
Incorporation to participate with the Common Stock in the distribution of such remaining assets,
pro rata based on the number of shares held by each such holder, treating for this purpose all
such securities as if they had been converted to Common Stock pursuant to the terms of this
Certificate of Incorporation immediately prior to such dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of
the Corporation. The aggregate amount which a holder of a share of Series A Preferred is
entitled to receive under Subsections 2(a) and 2(b) is hereinafter referred to as the “Series A
Liquidation Amount” and the aggregate amount which a holder of a share of Series B Preferred
is entitled to receive under Subsections 2(a) and 2(b) is hereinafter referred to as the “Series B
Liquidation Amount.”
(c) Deemed Liquidation Events.

(i) The following events shall be deemed to be a liquidation of the
Corporation for purposes of this Section 2, unless the holders of at least 80% of the Preferred
Stock then outstanding voting as a single class on an as converted basis (the “Required
Holders’) elect otherwise by written notice given to the Corporation at least 10 business days
prior to the effective date of any such event (any such event, unless such an election is made, is
referred to herein as a “Deemed Liquidation Event”):

(A) | amerger or consolidation in which
(1) the Corporation is a constituent party or

(IT) asubsidiary of the Corporation is a constituent party
and the Corporation issues shares of its capital stock
pursuant to such merger or consolidation,

except any such merger or consolidation involving the Corporation or a subsidiary in which the
shares of capital stock of the Corporation outstanding immediately prior to such merger or
consolidation continue to represent, or are converted or exchanged for shares of capital stock
which represent, immediately following such merger or consolidation, at least a majority, by
voting power, of the capital stock of (1) the surviving or resulting corporation or (2) if the
surviving or resulting corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary of another corporation
immediately following such merger or consolidation, the parent corporation of such surviving or
resulting corporation (provided that, for the purpose of this Subsection 2(c)(i), all shares of
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Options (as defined below) outstanding immediately
prior to such merger or consolidation or upon conversion of Convertible Securities (as defined
below) outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation shall be deemed to be
outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation and, if applicable, converted or
exchanged in such merger or consolidation on the same terms as the actual outstanding shares of
Common Stock are converted or exchanged); or

(B) _ the sale, lease, license, transfer or other disposition, in a
single transaction or series of related transactions, by the Corporation or any subsidiary of the
Corporation of all or substantially all the assets of the Corporation and its subsidiaries taken as a
whole, except where such sale, lease, license, transfer or other disposition is to a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Corporation.

(ii) The Corporation shall not have the power to effect any transaction
constituting a Deemed Liquidation Event pursuant to Subsection 2(c)(i)(A)(I) above unless the
agreement or plan of merger or consolidation provides that the consideration payable to the
stockholders of the Corporation shall be allocated among the holders of capital stock of the
Corporation in accordance with Subsections 2(a) and 2(b) above.

(iii) In the event of a Deemed Liquidation Event pursuant to Subsection
2(c)(i(A)(T)_or_2(c)(i)(B) above, if the Corporation does not effect a dissolution of the

Event, then (A) the Corporation shall deliver a written notice to each holder of Preferred Stock
no later than the 90" day after the Deemed Liquidation Event advising such holders of their right
(and the requirements to be met to secure such right) pursuant to the terms of the following
clause (B) to require the redemption of such shares of Preferred Stock, and (B) the Corporation
shall, unless otherwise requested in writing by the Required Holders, use the consideration
received by the Corporation for such Deemed Liquidation Event (net of any retained liabilities
associated with the assets sold or technology licensed, as determined in good faith by the Board
of Directors of the Corporation) (the “Net Proceeds’), to the extent legally available therefor, to
redeem, on the 120" day after such Deemed Liquidation Event, all outstanding shares of Series
A Preferred at a price per share equal to the Series A Liquidation Amount and all outstanding
shares of Series B Preferred at a price per share equal to the Series B Liquidation Amount. In the
event of a redemption pursuant to the preceding sentence, if the Net Proceeds are not sufficient
to redeem all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, or if the Corporation does not have sufficient
lawfully available funds to effect such redemption, the Corporation shall redeem a pro rata
portion of each holder’s shares of Preferred Stock to the fullest extent of such Net Proceeds or
such lawfully available funds, as the case may be, and, where such redemption is limited by the
amount of lawfully available funds, the Corporation shall redeem the remaining shares to have
been redeemed as soon as practicable after the Corporation has funds legally available therefor.
The provisions of Subsections 6(b) through 6(f) below shall apply, with such necessary changes
in the details thereof as are necessitated by the context, to the redemption of Preferred Stock
pursuant to this Subsection 2(c)(iii). Prior to the distribution or redemption provided for in this
Subsection 2(c)(iii), the Corporation shall not expend or dissipate the consideration received for
such Deemed Liquidation Event, except to discharge expenses incurred in connection with such
Deemed Liquidation Event or in the ordinary course of business.

stock of the Corporation upon any such Deemed Liquidation Event shall be the cash or the value

acquiring person, firm or other entity. The value of such property, rights or securities shall be
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

3. Voting.

action or consideration at any meeting of stockholders of the Corporation (or by written consent
of stockholders in lieu of meeting), each holder of outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be

a special meeting of such stockholders duly called for that purpose or pursuant to a written
consent of stockholders. At any meeting held for the purpose of electing a director, the presence
in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the class or series
entitled to elect such director shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of electing such director.
A vacancy in any directorship filled by the holders of any class or series shall be filled only by
vote or written consent in lieu of a meeting of the holders of such class or series or by any
remaining director or directors elected by the holders of such class or series pursuant to this

the vote or written consent of the holders of a greater number of shares of the Corporation is
required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, and in addition to any other vote required

4, Optional Conversion.

The holders of Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as follows (the “Conversion
Rights”):
(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at
the option of the holder thereof, at any time and from time to time, and without the payment of
additional consideration by the holder thereof, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable
shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Original Issue Price applicable to such
share by the Conversion Price (as defined below) applicable to such share as in effect at the time
of conversion. The “Conversion Price” of any series of Preferred Stock shall initially be equal
to the Original Issue Price for such series. The initial Conversion Price of each series of
Preferred Stock, and the rate at which shares of each series of Preferred Stock may be converted
into shares of Common Stock, shall be subject to adjustment as provided below.

In the event of a notice of redemption of any shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to
Section 6 hereof, the Conversion Rights of the shares designated for redemption shall terminate
at the close of business on the last full day preceding the date fixed for redemption, unless the
redemption price is not fully paid on such redemption date, in which case the Conversion Rights
for such shares shall continue until such price is paid in full. In the event of a liquidation,
dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation or a Deemed Liquidation Event, the Conversion
Rights shall terminate at the close of business on the last full day preceding the date fixed for the
payment of any such amounts distributable in such event to the holders of Preferred Stock.

(b) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued
upon conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would
otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair
market value of a share of Common Stock as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors
of the Corporation. Whether or not fractional shares would be issuable upon such conversion
shall be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock the holder is at
the time converting into Common Stock and the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion.

(i) In order for a holder of Preferred Stock to voluntarily convert
shares of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the
certificate or certificates for such shares of Preferred Stock (or, if such registered holder alleges
that such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement
reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that
may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such
certificate), at the office of the transfer agent for the Preferred Stock (or at the principal office of
the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent), together with written notice
that such holder elects to convert all or any number of the shares of Preferred Stock represented
by such certificate or certificates and, if applicable, any event on which such conversion is
contingent. Such notice shall state such holder’s name or the names of the nominees in which
such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued. If
required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shal] be endorsed or
accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the
Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or his, her or its attomey duly authorized in
writing. The close of business on the date of receipt by the transfer agent (or by the Corporation
if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent) of such certificates (or lost certificate
affidavit and agreement) and notice shall be the time of conversion (the “Conversion Time’),
and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the shares represented by such
certificate shall be deemed to be outstanding of record as of such date. The Corporation shall, as
soon as practicable after the Conversion Time, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of
Preferred Stock, or to his, her or its nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of
shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled, together with cash in lieu of any
fraction of a share and payment of any dividends declared but unpaid on the shares of Preferred
Stock converted.

(ii) The Corporation shall] at all times when Preferred Stock shall be
outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued stock, for the purpose
of effecting the conversion of Preferred Stock, such number of its duly authorized shares of
Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding
Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common
Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of Preferred
Stock, the Corporation shall take such corporate action as may be necessary to increase its
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient
for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite
stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation. Before
taking any action which would cause an adjustment reducing the Conversion Price of any series
of Preferred Stock below the then par value of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of Preferred Stock, the Corporation wil! take any corporate action which may, in the
opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Corporation may validly and legally issue
fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion Price.

(iii) | All shares of Preferred Stock which shall have been surrendered
for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights with
respect to such shares, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and to vote, shall
immediately cease and terminate at the Conversion Time, except only the right of the holders
thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor and to receive payment of any
dividends declared but unpaid thereon. Any shares of Preferred Stock so converted shall be
retired and cancelled and shal! not be reissued as shares of such series, and the Corporation
(without the need for stockholder action) may from time to time take such appropriate action as
may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Preferred Stock accordingly.

(iv) | Upon any such conversion, no adjustment to the Conversion Price
shall be made for any declared but unpaid dividends on any series of Preferred Stock surrendered
for conversion or on the Common Stock delivered upon conversion.

(v) | The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and other similar taxes
that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon
conversion of shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4. The Corporation shall not,
however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in
the issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in which the
shares of Preferred Stock so converted were registered, and no such issuance or delivery shall be
made unless and until the person or entity requesting such issuance has paid to the Corporation
the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax
has been paid.

(d) Adjustments to Conversion Price for Diluting Issues.

(1) Special Definitions. For purposes of this Article Fourth, the
following definitions shall apply:

(A) “Option” shall mean rights, options or warrants to
subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire Common Stock or Convertible Securities.

10
after the Series B Orginal Issue Date; provided that
any Options for such shares that expire or terminate
unexercised or any restricted stock repurchased by

number unless and until such shares are regranted as
new stock grants (or as new Options) pursuant to
the terms of such plan; or

(V) shares of Common Stock (a) issued or issuable
solely in consideration for the acquisition (whether
by merger or otherwise) by the Corporation or any
subsidiary of all or substantially all of the capital

(b) and (c) above is approved by a Majority
Directors Vote;

(VI up to 99,525 shares of Common Stock issued or
issuable upon the exercise or conversion of warrants
outstanding on the Series B Original Issue Date.

(ii) | No Adjustment_of Conversion Price. No adjustment in the
Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock shall be made as the result of the issuance or
deemed issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock if prior to such issuance or deemed
issuance, the Corporation receives written notice from the Required Holders agreeing that no
such adjustment shall be made as the result of the issuance or deemed issuance of such
Additional Shares of Common Stock.

(iii) Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock.

(A) Ifthe Corporation at any time or from time to time after the
Series B Original Issue Date shall issue any Options or Convertible Securities (excluding
Options or Convertible Securities which, upon exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, would
entitle the holder thereof to receive Exempted Securities pursuant to Subsection 4(d)(i)(D)(D),
(iD, (I) or (V)) or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of
securities entitled to receive any such Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum
number of shares of Common Stock (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto, assuming the

11
satisfaction of any conditions to exercisability, convertibility or exchangeability but without
regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable
upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities and Options therefor,
the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to be Additional
Shares of Common Stock issued as of the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shall
have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date.

(B) If the terms of any Option or Convertible Security, the
issuance of which resulted in an adjustment to the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred
Stock pursuant to the terms of Subsection 4(d)(iv) below, are revised (either automatically
pursuant to the provisions contained therein or as a result of an amendment to such terms) to
provide for either (1) any increase or decrease in the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any such Option or Convertible Secunty
or (2) any increase or decrease in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon such
exercise, conversion or exchange, then, effective upon such increase or decrease becoming
effective, the Conversion Price or Prices computed upon the original issue of such Option or
Convertible Security (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto) shall be
readjusted to such Conversion Price or Prices as would have obtained had such revised terms
been in effect upon the original date of issuance of such Option or Convertible Security.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no readjustment pursuant to this clause (B) shall have the effect
of increasing the Conversion Price with respect to any series of Preferred Stock to an amount
which exceeds the lower of (i) the applicable Conversion Price on the original adjustment date,
or (ii) the applicable Conversion Price that would have resulted from any issuances of Additional
Shares of Common Stock between the original adjustment date and such readjustment date.

(C) If the terms of any Option or Convertible Security
(excluding Options or Convertible Securities which, upon exercise, conversion or exchange
thereof, would entitle the holder thereof to receive Exempted Securities pursuant to Subsection
4(d)()(D)(D, (1), (1) or (V)), the issuance of which did not result in an adjustment to the
Conversion Price pursuant to the terms of Subsection 4(d)(iv) below (either because the
consideration per share (determined pursuant to Subsection 4(d)(v) hereof) of the Additional
Shares of Common Stock subject thereto was equal to or greater than the Conversion Price then
in effect with respect to any series of Preferred Stock, or because such Option or Convertible
Security was issued before the Series B Original Issue Date), are revised after the Series B
Onginal Issue Date (either automatically pursuant to the provisions contained therein or as a
result of an amendment to such terms) to provide for either (1) any increase or decrease in the
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any
such Option or Convertible Security or (2) any increase or decrease in the consideration payable
to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion or exchange, then such Option or Convertible
Security, as so amended, and the Additional Shares of Common Stock subject thereto
(determined in the manner provided in Subsection 4(d)(iii)(A) above) shall be deemed to have
been issued effective upon such increase or decrease becoming effective.

(D) Upon the expiration or termination of any unexercised
Option or unconverted or unexchanged Convertible Security which resulted (either upon its
original issuance or upon a revision of its terms) in an adjustment to the Conversion Price of any
series of Preferred Stock pursuant to the terms of Subsection 4(d)(iv) below, the Conversion

12
Price of such series shall be readjusted to such Conversion Price as would have obtained had
such Option or Convertible Security never been issued.

(iv) | Adjustment_of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional
Shares of Common Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Series B

Original Issue Date issue Additional Shares of Common Stock (including Additional Shares of
Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to Subsection 4(d)(iii)), without consideration or
for a consideration per share less than the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock in
effect immediately prior to such issue, then the Conversion Price of such series shal] be reduced,
concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent)
determined in accordance with the following formula:

CP, =CP,; * (A+B)+(A+C)
For purposes of the foregoing formula, the following definitions shall apply:

(A) “CP,” shall mean the Conversion Price in effect
immediately after such issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock;

(B) “CP,” shall mean the Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock;

(C) “A” shall mean the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding (including shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock) immediately prior to such issue of Additional Shares of Common
Stock;

(D) “B” shall mean the number of shares of Common Stock
that would have been issued if such Additional Shares of Common Stock had been issued at a
price per share equal to CP, (determined by dividing the aggregate consideration received by the
Corporation in respect of such issue by CP); and

(E)  “C” shall mean the number of such Additional Shares of
Common Stock issued in such transaction.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this
Subsection 4(d), the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional
Shares of Common Stock shall be computed as follows:

(A) Cashand Property: Such consideration shall:

(D insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
ageregate amount of cash received by the
Corporation, excluding amounts paid or payable for
accrued interest;

(II) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair market value thereof at the

13
determined by dividing

(vi)

(iI)

time of such issue, as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors of the Corporation; and

in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock
are issued together with other shares or securities or
other assets of the Corporation for consideration
which covers both, be the proportion of such
consideration so received, computed as provided in
clauses (I) and (Il) above, as determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

(B) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per

share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been
issued pursuant to Subsection 4(d)(iii), relating to Options and Convertible Securities, shall be

()

(I)

the total amount, if any, received or receivable by
the Corporation as consideration for the issue of
such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the
minimum aggregate amount of additional
consideration (as set forth in the instruments
relating thereto, without regard to any provision
contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of
such consideration) payable to the Corporation upon
the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the
case of Options for Convertible Securities, the
exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities
and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, by

the maximum number of shares of Common Stock
(as set forth in the instruments relating thereto,
without regard to any provision contained therein
for a subsequent adjustment of such number)
issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities.

Multiple Closing Dates. In the event the Corporation shall issue on

more than one date Additional Shares of Common Stock that are a part of one transaction or a
series of related transactions and that would result in an adjustment to the Conversion Price of
any series of Preferred Stock pursuant to the terms of Subsection 4(d)(iv) above, and such
issuances occur within a period of no more than 30 days from the first such issuance to the final
such issuance, then, upon the final such issuance, the applicable Conversion Price shall be
readjusted to give effect to all such issuances as if they occurred on the date of the first such

14
issuance (and without giving effect to any additional adjustments as a result of any such
subsequent issuances within such period).

(e) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If the Corporation shall at

any time or from time to time after the Series B Original Issue Date effect a subdivision of the
outstanding Common Stock without a comparable subdivision of Preferred Stock or combine the
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock without a comparable combination of the Common Stock,
the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately before that
subdivision or combination shall be proportionately decreased so that the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be increased in
proportion to such increase in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. If
the Corporation shall at any time or from time to time after the Series B Original Issue Date
combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock without a comparable combination of the
Preferred Stock or effect a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock without a
comparable subdivision of the Common Stock, the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred
Stock in effect immediately before the combination or subdivision shall be proportionately
increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of
such series shal] be decreased in proportion to such decrease in the aggregate number of shares
of Common Stock outstanding. Any adjustment under this subsection shall become effective at
the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective.

(f) Adjustment _for Certain Dividends and Distributions. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Series B Original Issue Date shall make or

issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive,
a dividend or other distribution payable on the Common Stock in additional shares of Common
Stock, then and in each such event the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock in
effect immediately before such event shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance or, in the
event such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, by
multiplying the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock then in effect by a fraction:

(1) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of
business on such record date, and

(2) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of
business on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of
such dividend or distnbution;

provided, however, that if such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend is not fully
paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the Conversion Price of
each series of Preferred Stock shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on
such record date and thereafter the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock shall be
adjusted pursuant to this subsection as of the time of actual payment of such dividends or
distributions; and provided further, however, that no such adjustment shall be made if the holders
of Preferred Stock simultaneously receive a dividend or other distribution of shares of Common
Stock in a number equal to the number of shares of Common Stock they would have received if

15
all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock on the date of
such event.

(g) Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. In the event the

Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Series B Original Issue Date shall make or
issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive,
a dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the Corporation (other than a distribution
of shares of Common Stock in respect of outstanding shares of Common Stock) or in other
property and the provisions of Section 1 do not otherwise preclude such dividend or distribution,
then and in each such event the holders of Preferred Stock shall receive, simultaneously with the
distribution to the holders of Common Stock, a dividend or other distribution of such securities
or other property in an amount equal to the amount of such securities or other property as they
would have received if all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock had been converted into
Common Stock on the date of such event.

(h) Adjustment for Merger or Reorganization, etc. Subject to the provisions
of Subsection 2(c), if there shall occur any reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,

consolidation or merger involving the Corporation in which the Common Stock (but not
Preferred Stock) is converted into or exchanged for securities, cash or other property (other than
a transaction covered by Subsection (e), (f) or (g) of this Section 4), then, following any such
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger, each share of Preferred
Stock shall thereafter be convertible in lieu of the Common Stock into which it was convertible
prior to such event into the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property which a holder
of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation issuable upon conversion of one
share of Preferred Stock immediately prior to such reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, consolidation or merger would have been entitled to receive pursuant to such
transaction; and, in such case, appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith by the Board
of Directors of the Corporation) shall be made in the application of the provisions in this
Section 4 with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the holders of Preferred Stock, to
the end that the provisions set forth in this Section 4 (including provisions with respect to
changes in and other adjustments of the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock) shall
thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any securities or other
property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock.

(i) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4,
the Corporation at its expense shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable but in any event not
later than 10 days thereafter, compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the
terms hereof and furnish to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such
adjustment or readjustment (including the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property
into which the Preferred Stock is convertible) and showing in detail the facts upon which such
adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the written request at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock (but in any
event not later than 10 days thereafter), furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a
certificate setting forth (i) the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock then in effect
and held by such holder, and (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount. if any,
of other securities, cash or property which then would be received upon the conversion of
Preferred Stock.

(j) Notice of Record Date. In the event:

(i) the Corporation shall take a record of the holders of its Common
Stock (or other stock or securities at the time issuable upon conversion of Preferred Stock) for
the purpose of entitling or enabling them to receive any dividend or other distribution, or to
receive any right to subscribe for or purchase any shares of stock of any class or any other
securities, or to receive any other right;

(ii) of any capital reorganization of the Corporation, any
reclassification of the Common Stock of the Corporation, or any Deemed Liquidation Event; or

(ii) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-
up of the Corporation,

then, and in each such case, the Corporation will give or cause to be given to the holders of
Preferred Stock a notice specifying, as the case may be, (i) the record date for such dividend,
distribution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right, or (ii)
the effective date on which such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer,
dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is proposed to take place, and the time, if any is to be
fixed, as of which the holders of record of Common Stock (or such other stock or securities at
the time issuable upon the conversion of Preferred Stock) shall be entitled to exchange their
shares of Common Stock (or such other stock or securities) for securities or other property
deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer,
dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, and the amount per share and character of such exchange
applicable to Preferred Stock and the Common Stock. Such notice shall be given at least 15
business days prior to the record date or effective date for the event specified in such notice.

5. Mandatory Conversion.

(a) Upon the earlier of (A) the closing of the sale of shares of Common Stock
to the public at a price of at least $7.827 per share (subject to appropriate adjustment for stock
splits, stock dividends, combinations and other similar recapitalizations affecting such shares), in
a firm-commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, resulting in at least $25,000,000 of proceeds, net
of the underwriting discount and commissions, to the Corporation or (B) a date specified by vote
or written consent of the Required Holders (the date of such closing or such vote or written
consent is referred to herein as the “Mandatory Conversion Date”), (i) all outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock, at the then
effective conversion rate and (ii) such shares may not be reissued by the Corporation as shares of
such series.

(b) All holders of record of shares of Preferred Stock shall be given written
notice of the Mandatory Conversion Date and the place designated for mandatory conversion of
all such shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 5. Such notice need not be given in
advance of the occurrence of the Mandatory Conversion Date. Upon receipt of such notice, each

17
holder of shares of Preferred Stock shall surrender his, her or its certificate or certificates for al]
such shares to the Corporation at the place designated in such notice, and shall thereafter receive
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to this Section 5. On the Mandatory Conversion Date, all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock
shall be deemed to have been converted into shares of Common Stock, which shall be deemed to
be outstanding of record, and all rights with respect to Preferred Stock so converted, including
the rights, if any, to receive notices and vote (other than as a holder of Common Stock), will
terminate, except only the rights of the holders thereof, upon surrender of their certificate or
certificates therefor, to receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which
such Preferred Stock has been converted, and payment of any declared but unpaid dividends
thereon. If so required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be
endorsed or accompanied by written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to
the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or by his, her or its attorney duly
authorized in writing. As soon as practicable after the Mandatory Conversion Date and the
surrender of the certificate or certificates for Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall cause to be
issued and delivered to such holder, or on his, her or its written order, a certificate or certificates
for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable on such conversion in accordance with
the provisions hereof and cash as provided in Subsection 4(b) in respect of any fraction of a
share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion.

(c) Subject to Subsection 5(b) above, all certificates evidencing shares of
Preferred Stock which are required to be surrendered for conversion in accordance with the
provisions hereof shall, from and after the Mandatory Conversion Date, be deemed to have been
retired and cancelled and the shares of Preferred Stock represented thereby converted into
Common Stock for all purposes, notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to
surrender such certificates on or prior to such date. Such converted Preferred Stock may not be
reissued as shares of such series, and the Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate action
(without the need for stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number
of shares of Preferred Stock accordingly.

6. Redemption.

(a) Redemption. Shares of Preferred Stock shall be redeemed by the
Corporation out of funds lawfully available therefor at a price equal to the Original Issue Price
applicable to such shares, together with any dividends accrued or declared but unpaid thereon
(the “Redemption Price”), in three annual installments commencing 60 days after receipt by the
Corporation at any time on or after the fifth anniversary of the Series B Original Issue Date from
the Required Holders of written notice requesting redemption of all shares of Preferred Stock
(the date of each such installment being referred to as a “Redemption Date”). On each
Redemption Date, the Corporation shall redeem, on a pro rata basis in accordance with the
number of shares of Preferred Stock owned by each holder, that number of outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock determined by dividing (i) the total number of shares of Preferred Stock
outstanding immediately por to such Redemption Date by (ii) the number of remaining
Redemption Dates (including the Redemption Date to which such calculation applies). If the
Corporation does not have sufficient funds legally available to redeem on any Redemption Date
all shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such Redemption Date, the Corporation shall
redeem a pro rata portion of each holder’s redeemable shares out of funds legally available

18
therefor and shall redeem the remaining shares as soon as practicable after the Corporation has
funds legally available therefor.

(b) Redemption Notice. Written notice of the mandatory redemption (the
“Redemption Notice’) shall be given to each holder of record of Preferred Stock not less than
40 days prior to each Redemption Date. Each Redemption Notice shall state:

(I) the number of shares of Preferred Stock held by the
holder that the Corporation shall redeem on the
Redemption Date specified in the Redemption
Notice;

(II) the Redemption Date and the Redemption Price;

(III) the date upon which the holder’s nght to convert
such shares terminates (as determined in accordance

with Subsection 4(a)); and

(IV) _ that the holder is to surrender to the Corporation, in
the manner and at the place designated, his, her or
its certificate or certificates representing the shares
of Preferred Stock to be redeemed.

(c) Surrender_of Certificates; Payment. On or before the applicable
Redemption Date, each holder of shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such Redemption

Date, unless such holder has exercised his, her or its right to convert such shares as provided in
Section 4 hereof, shall surrender the certificate or certificates representing such shares to the
Corporation, in the manner and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice, and thereupon
the Redemption Price for such shares shall be payable to the order of the person whose name
appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof. In the event fewer than all of the
shares of Preferred Stock represented by a certificate are redeemed, a new certificate
representing the unredeemed shares of Preferred Stock shal! promptly be issued to such holder.

(d) Rights Subsequent to Redemption. If the Redemption Notice shall have

been duly given, and if on the applicable Redemption Date the Redemption Price payable upon
redemption of the shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such Redemption Date is paid or
tendered for payment or deposited with an independent payment agent so as to be available
therefor, then notwithstanding that the certificates evidencing any of the shares of Preferred
Stock so called for redemption shall not have been surrendered, dividends with respect to such
shares of Preferred Stock shall cease to accrue after such Redemption Date and all rights with
respect to such shares shal] forthwith after the Redemption Date terminate, except only the right
of the holders to receive the Redemption Price without interest upon surrender of their
certificates therefor.

(e) Redeemed or Otherwise Acquired Shares. Any shares of Preferred Stock

which are redeemed or otherwise acquired by the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries shall be
automatically and immediately canceled and retired and shall not be reissued, sold or transferred.

19
Neither the Corporation nor any of its subsidiaries may exercise any voting or other rights
granted to the holders of Preferred Stock following redemption.

(p Failure to Redeem. If the Corporation for any reason fails to redeem any
of the shares of Preferred Stock in accordance with this Section 6 on or prior to the redemption
dates determined in accordance with this Section 6, then the Corporation shall become obligated
to pay, quarterly and in arrears, in addition to the Redemption Price, interest on the unpaid
balance of such price, which shall accrue at a rate equal to the lesser of (i) fifteen percent (15%)
per annum or (ii) the maximum interest rate allowable under applicable law, until such price is
paid in full. If such failure shall continue for more than 90 days and the Preferred Directors do
not constitute a majority of the number of directors constituting the whole Board of Directors of
the Corporation, then, upon receipt of written notice from the Required Holders, the total number
of directors shall be increased to accommodate, and the holders of Preferred Stock shall be
entitled, voting exclusively and as a single class, to elect, such number of additional directors as
is necessary to give the holders of Preferred Stock the right to elect a majority of the directors
constituting the whole Board of Directors of the Corporation.

7. Waiver. Any of the rights, powers, preferences and other terms of Preferred Stock set
forth herein may be waived by the affirmative consent or vote of the Required Holders.

8. Notices. Any notice to be given to the Corporation or a holder of its capital stock
hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed effectively given: (a) upon personal delivery
to the party to be notified, (b) when sent by electronic communication in compliance with the
provisions of the General Corporation Law or (c) when mailed, postage prepaid. All
communications to the Corporation shall be sent to the Corporation’s principal place of business,
and all communications to any holder of the Corporation’s capital stock shall be sent to such
holder’s most recent address as appears in the Corporation’s records.

have been, a director or officer of the Corporation and was or is a party or is threatened to be
made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director
or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director,

20
officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, against expenses (including attomeys’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement incurred in connection with any such action, suit or proceeding, to the maximum
extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as the same exists or
may hereafter be amended. The foregoing right of indemnification shall in no way be exclusive
of any other nights of indemnification to which any such director or officer may be entitled,
under any by-law, agreement, vote of directors or stockholders or otherwise. No amendment to
or repeal of the provisions of this Article SIXTH shall deprive a director or officer of the benefit
hereof with respect to any act or failure to act occurring prior to such amendment or repeal. In
furtherance of and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Corporation shall advance expenses,
including attorneys’ fees, incurred by an officer or director of the Corporation in defending any
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding in advance of the final
disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of
such director or officer to repay such advances if it shall be ultimately determined that he is not
entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation
shall not be required to indemnify or advance expenses to any person in connection with any
action, suit, proceeding, claim or counterclaim initiated by or on behalf of such person.

SEVENTH: Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed between this
Corporation and its creditors or any class of them or between this Corporation and its
stockholders or any class of them, any court of equitable jurisdiction within the State of
Delaware may, on the application in a summary way of this Corporation or of any creditor or
stockholder thereof or on the application of any receiver or receivers appointed for this
Corporation under Section 291 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code or on the application of trustees
in dissolution or of any receiver or receivers appointed for this Corporation under Section 279 of
Title 8 of the Delaware Code order a meeting of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the
stockholders or class of stockholders of this Corporation, as the case may be, to be summoned in
such manner as said court directs. If a majority in number representing three-fourths in value of
the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of this
Corporation, as the case may be, agree to any compromise or arrangement and to any
reorganization of this Corporation as a consequence of such compromise or arrangement, the
said compromise or arrangement and the said reorganization shall, if sanctioned by the court to
which the said application has been made, be binding on all the creditors or class of creditors,
and/or on all] the stockholders or class of stockholders, of this Corporation, as the case may be,
and also on this Corporation.

EIGHTH: No director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the
Corporation or to any of its stockholders for monetary damages arising out of such director’s
breach of fiduciary duty as a director of the Corporation, except to the extent that the elimination
or limitation of such liability is not permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of
