candidates have been placed in nomination prior to the voting and (ii) the stockholder has given
notice at the meeting, prior to the voting, of such stockholder’s intention to cumulate such
stockholder’s votes. If any stockholder has given proper notice to cumulate votes, all
stockholders may cumulate their votes for any candidates who have been properly placed in
nomination. Under cumulative voting, the candidates receiving the highest number of votes, up
to the number of directors to be elected, are elected.

(v) Removal. During such time or times that the Company is
subject to Section 2115(b) of the CGCL, one or more directors may be removed from office at
any time without cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the
outstanding shares entitled to vote for that director as provided above; provided, however, that
unless the entire Board is removed, no individual director may be removed when the votes cast
against such director’s removal, or not consenting in writing to such removal, would be sufficient
to elect that director if voted cumulatively at an election which the same total number of votes
were cast (or, if such action is taken by written consent, all shares entitled to vote were voted)
and the entire number of directors authorized at the time of such director’s most recent election
were then being elected.

reorganization or (B) any transaction or series of related transactions (whether by merger,
consolidation, stock exchange or otherwise) in which fifty percent (50%) or more of the
Company’s voting power is transferred; provided that an Acquisition shall not include (x) any
consolidation or merger effected exclusively to change the domicile of the Company, (y) any
consolidation or merger with a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company for the primary
purpose of creating a holding company that will be owned substantially in the same proportions

9.

1044160 v3/HN

Stock Market (“Nasdaq”), the value shall be based on a formula approved by the Board and
derived from the closing prices of the securities on such exchange or Nasdaq over a specified
time period;

(B) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall
be based on a formula approved by the Board and derived from the closing bid or sales prices
(whichever is applicable) of such securities over a specified time period; and

the fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board.

(ii) | The method of valuation of securities subject to investment
letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of
4 stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount
from the market value determined as specified above in Section 4(c)(i) to reflect the approximate
fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board.

applicable “Series Preferred Conversion Price,” calculated as provided in Section S{c).

series of Series Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock shall initially be the Original Issue Price
of such series of Series Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock (the “Conversion Price” or for all
series of Series Preferred and the Series E-1 Preferred Stock, the “Series Preferred Conversion
Price”). Such initial Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be adjusted from time to time in
accordance with this Section 5. All references to the Series Preferred Conversion Price herein
shall mean the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price as so adjusted.

(d) Mechanics of Conversion. Each holder of Series Preferred or Series
E-1 Preferred Stock who desires to convert the same into shares of Common Stock pursuant to
this Section 5 shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of
the Company or any transfer agent for the Series Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock, as
applicable, and shall give written notice to the Company at such office that such holder elects to
convert the same. Such notice shall! state the number of shares of Series Preferred or Series E-1
Preferred Stock being converted. Thereupon, the Company shall promptly issue and deliver at
such office to such holder a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock
to which such holder is entitled and shall promptly pay (i) in cash or, to the extent sufficient
funds are not then legally available therefor, in Common Stock (at the Common Stock’s fair
market value determined by the Board as of the date of such conversion), any declared and
unpaid dividends on the shares of Series Preferred or Series E-] Preferred Stock being converted
and (ii) in cash (at the Common Stock’s fair market value determined by the Board as of the date
of conversion) the value of any fractional share of Common Stock otherwise issuable to any
holder of Series Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock. Such conversion shall be deemed to
have been made at the close of business on the date of such surrender of the certificates
representing the shares of Series Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock to be converted, and the
person entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be
treated for all purposes as the record holder of such shares of Common Stock on such date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the conversion is in connection with an underwritten offering
of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the conversion may,
at the option of any holder tendering Series Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock for
conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of securities
pursuant to such offering, in which event the persons entitled to receive the Common Stock upon
conversion of the Series Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have
converted such Series Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock, as applicable until immediately
prior to the closing of such sale of securities.

(ce) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. !f at any time or
from time to time after the date that the first share of Series E-] Preferred Stock is issued (the
“Original Issue Date”) the Company effects a subdivision of the outstanding Common Stock
without a corresponding subdivision of any series of Series Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred
Stock, the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price in effect immediately before that

11.

1044160 v3/HIN
subdivision shall be proportionately decreased. Conversely, if at any time or from time to time
after the Original Issue Date the Company combines the outstanding shares of Common Stock
into a smaller number of shares without a corresponding combination of any series of Series
Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock, the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price in
effect immediately before the combination shall be proportionately increased. Any adjustment
under this Section 5(e) shall become effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision
or combination becomes effective.

(f) Adjustment for Common Stock Dividends and Distributions. If at
any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date the Company pays to holders of
Common Stock a dividend or other distribution in additional shares of Common Stock without a
corresponding dividend or other distribution to holders of Series Preferred or Series E-1]
Preferred Stock, each Series Preferred Conversion Price that is then in effect shall be decreased
as of the time of such issuance, as provided below:

(i) Each Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be adjusted by
multiplying each Series Preferred Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction equal to:

(A) _ the numerator of which is the total number of shares
of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance, and

(B) the denominator of which is the total number of
shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance
plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or
distribution;

(ii) If the Company fixes a record date to determine which
holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution, the
applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be fixed as of the close of business on such
record date and the number of shares of Common Stock shall be calculated immediately prior to
the close of business on such record date; and

(iii) If such record date is fixed and such dividend is not fully
paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, each Series Preferred
Conversion Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record date
and thereafter each Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this Section
5(f) to reflect the actual payment of such dividend or distribution.

(iv) In the event the Company shall declare a distribution
payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by the Company or other
persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred to in Section 4(e)
above to holders of Common Stock without a corresponding distribution to holders of Series
Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock, then, in each such case for the purpose of this Section
4(f), the holders of the Series Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock, as applicable, shall be
entitled to a proportionate share of any such distribution as though they were the holders of the
number of shares of Common Stock of this Company into which their shares of Series Preferred

1044160 v3/LIN
or Series E-1 Preferred Stock are convertible as of the record date fixed for the determination of
the holders of Common Stock of this Company entitled to receive such distribution.

(g) Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange, Substitution,
Reorganization, Merger or Consolidation. If at any time or from time to time after the
Original [ssue Date, the Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Series Preferred or
Series E-1 Preferred Stock is changed into the same or a different number of shares of any class
or classes of stock, whether by recapitalization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or
otherwise (other than an Acquisition or Asset Transfer as defined in Section 4 or a subdivision or
combination of shares or stock dividend or a reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale of
assets provided for elsewhere in this Section 5), in any such event each holder of Series Preferred
or Series E-1 Preferred Stock shall then have the right but shall have no obligation to convert
such stock into the kind and amount of stock and other securities and property receivable upon
such recapitalization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or other change by holders of the
maximum number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series Preferred or
Series E-1 Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately prior to such recapitalization,
reclassification, merger, consolidation or change, all subject to further adjustment as provided
herein or with respect to such other securities or property by the terms thereof. In any such case,
appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 5 with
respect to the rights of the holders of Series Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock after the
capital reorganization to the end that the provisions of this Section 5 (including adjustment of the
applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price then in effect and the number of shares issuable
upon conversion of such Series Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock, as applicable) shall be
applicable after that event and be as nearly equivalent as practicable.

(h) Sale of Shares Below Series D Preferred Conversion Price, Series
C Preferred Conversion Price, or Series E Preferred Conversion Price, as applicable.

(i) If at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue
Date, the Company issues or sells, or is deemed by the express provisions of this Section 5(h) to
have issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock (as defined below) other than as
provided in Section 5(f) or 5(g) above, for an Effective Price (as defined below) Jess than (x) in
the case of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock, the Series E Preferred
Stock, and the Series E-1 Preferred Stock, the then effective Conversion Price for the Series E
Preferred Stock, (y) in the case of the Series D Preferred Stock, the then effective Conversion
Price for the Series D Preferred Stock, or (z) in the case of the Series C Preferred Stock, the then
effective Conversion Price for the Series C Preferred Stock, respectively (the Conversion Prices
so referenced in (x), (y), and (z) being the “Applicable Anti-Dilution Reference Price”), then and
in each such case (each, a “Qualifying Additional Issuance”) the then existing Series Preferred
Conversion Price for a series of Series Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock shall be reduced,
as applicable, as of the opening of business on the date of such issue or sale, to a price
determined by multiplying the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such issuance or sale by a fraction equal to:

(A) _ the numerator of which shall be (A) the number of
shares of Common Stock deemed outstanding (as determined below) immediately prior to such
issue or sale, plus (B) the number of shares of Common Stock which the Aggregate

13.

1044] 66 v3/1IN
Consideration (as defined below) received or deemed received by the Company for the total
number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued would purchase at the Applicable
Anti-Dilution Reference Price, and

(B) the denominator of which shall be the number of
shares of Common Stock deemed outstanding (as determined below) immediately prior to such
issue or sale plus the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued.

For the purposes of the preceding sentence, the number of shares of Common Stock
deemed to be outstanding as of a given date shall be the sum of (A) the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding, (B) the number of shares of Common Stock into which the then
outstanding shares of Series Preferred and Series E-1 Preferred Stock could be converted if fully
converted on the day immediately preceding the given date, and (C) the number of shares of
Common Stock which are issuable upon the exercise or conversion of all other rights, options
and convertible securities outstanding on the day immediately preceding the given date.

(ii) | No adjustment shall be made to any Series Preferred
Conversion Price in an amount less than one cent per share. Any adjustment otherwise required
by this Section 5(h) that is not required to be made due to the preceding sentence shall be
included in any subsequent adjustment to such Series Preferred Conversion Price.

(iii) | For the purpose of making any adjustment required under
this Section 5(b), the aggregate consideration received by the Company for any issue or sale of
securities (the “Aggregate Consideration”) shall be defined as: (A) to the extent it consists of
cash, be computed at the net amount of cash received by the Company after deduction of any
underwriting or similar commissions, compensation or concessions paid or allowed by the
Company in connection with such issue or sale but without deduction of any expenses payable
by the Company, (B) to the extent it consists of property other than cash, be computed at the fair
value of that property as determined in good faith by the Board irrespective of any accounting
treatment, and (C) if Additional Shares of Common Stock, Convertible Securities (as defined
below) or rights or options to purchase either Additional Shares of Common Stock or
Convertible Securities are issued or sold together with other stock or securities or other assets of
the Company for a consideration which covers both, be computed as the portion of the
consideration so received that may be reasonably determined in good faith by the Board to be
allocable to such Additional Shares of Common Stock, Convertible Securities or rights or
options.

(iv) For the purpose of the adjustment required under this
Section 5(h), if the Company issues or sells (x) Preferred Stock or other stock, options, warrants,
purchase rights or other securities convertible or exchangeable into, Additional Shares of
Common Stock (such convertible or exchangeable stock or securities being herein referred to as
“Convertible Securities”) or (y) rights or options for the purchase of Additional Shares of
Common Stock or Convertible Securities and if the Effective Price of such Additional Shares of
Common Stock is less than any Series Preferred Conversion Price, in each case the Company
shall be deemed to have issued at the time of the issuance of such rights or options or
Convertible Securities the maximum number of Additional Shares of Common Stock issuable
upon exercise or conversion or exchange thereof and to have received as consideration for the

14.

1044160 v3/HN
issuance of such shares an amount equal to the total amount of the consideration, if any, received
by the Company for the issuance of such rights or options or Convertible Securities plus:

(A) in the case of such rights or options, the minimum
amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon the exercise of such rights or
options; and

(B) in the case of Convertible Securities, the minimum
amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon the conversion or exchange
thereof (other than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible
Securities); provided that if the minimum amounts of such consideration cannot be ascertained,
but are a function of antidilution or similar protective clauses, the Company shall be deemed to
have received the minimum amounts of consideration without reference to such clauses.

(C) If the minimum amount of consideration payable to
the Company upon the exercise or conversion of rights, options or Convertible Securities is
reduced over time or on the occurrence or non-occurrence of specified events other than by
reason of antidilution adjustments, the Effective Price shall be recalculated using the figure to
which such minimum amount of consideration is reduced; provided further, that if the minimum
amount of consideration payable to the Company upon the exercise or conversion or exchange of
such rights, options or Convertible Securities is subsequently increased, the Effective Price shall
be again recalculated using the increased minimum amount of consideration payable to the
Company upon the exercise or conversion or exchange of such rights, options or Convertible
Securities.

(D) No further adjustment of any Series Preferred
Conversion Price, as adjusted upon the issuance of such rights, options or Convertible Securities,
shall be made as a result of the actual issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock or the
exercise of any such rights or options or the conversion of any such Convertible Securities. If
any such rights or options or the conversion privilege represented by any such Convertible
Securities shall expire without having been exercised, the applicable Series Preferred Conversion
Price as adjusted upon the issuance of such rights, options or Convertible Securities shall be
readjusted to the Series Preferred Conversion Price which would have been in effect had an
adjustment been made on the basis that the only Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued
were the Additional Shares of Common Stock, if any, actually issued or sold on the exercise of
such rights or options or rights of conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, and
such Additional Shares of Common Stock, if any, were issued or sold for the consideration
actually received by the Company upon such exercise, plus the consideration, if any, actually
received by the Company for the granting of all such rights or options, whether or not exercised,
plus the consideration received for issuing or selling the Convertible Securities actually
converted or exchanged, plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the Company (other
than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities) on the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, provided that such readjustment shall not
apply to prior conversions of Series Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock.

(v) For the purpose of making any adjustment to the
Conversion Price of the Series Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock required under this

15.

1044160 v3/HIN
Section 5(h), “Additional Shares of Common Stock” shall mean all shares of Common Stock
issued by the Company or deemed to be issued pursuant to this Section 5(h) (including shares of
Common Stock subsequently reacquired or retired by the Company), other than:

(A) shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of
any series of Series Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock;

(B) up to 5,283,108 shares issued after March 1, 2012
(as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like with
respect to such shares after the filing date hereof) of Common Stock and/or options or other
Common Stock purchase rights and the Common Stock issued pursuant to such options or other
rights (the “Option Pool”) (as such Option Pool may be increased from time to time by approval
of the Board of Directors and the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of
the outstanding shares of Series Preferred Stock if required by Section 2(b) hereof) issued to
employees, officers or directors of, or consultants or advisors to the Company or any subsidiary,
pursuant to the Company’s 2003 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), or any additional shares of
Common Stock issued to employees, officers or directors of, or consultants or advisors to the
Company or any subsidiary, pursuant to stock purchase or stock option plans or other
arrangements that are unanimously approved by the Board of Directors; provided, however, that
such amount shall be increased to reflect any shares of Common Stock (i) which are not issued
due to the expiration or termination of an option, right or agreement to acquire such stock, and
which have reverted to and are again issuable under the Plan (“Unexercised Options”) or (ii)
reacquired by the Company from employees, directors or consultants at cost (or the lesser of cost
or fair market value) pursuant to agreements which permit the Company to repurchase such
shares upon termination of services to the Company;

(C) shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to the
exercise of Convertible Securities outstanding as of the Original Issue Date;

(D) shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities
issued for consideration other than cash pursuant to a merger, consolidation, acquisition,

(E) shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities

or debt financing from a bank or similar financial institution approved by the Board and provided
that the issuance of such shares is primarily for purposes other than the raising of additional
capital through an equity financing;

(F) shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities
issued by the Company pursuant to a registration statement filed under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, if upon the closing of such offering all of the outstanding shares of Series
Preferred and Series E-1 Preferred Stock have been converted to Common Stock either (i) at the
election of the holders of such Preferred Stock as provided in Section S(a) hereof, or (11) pursuant
to the provisions for the automatic conversion of such Series Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred
Stock as provided in Section 5(k) hereof;

1044160 v3/HN
(G) any Common Stock or Convertible Securities issued
in connection with strategic transactions involving the Company and other entities, including
(i) joint ventures, manufacturing, marketing or distribution arrangements or (ii) technology
transfer or development arrangements; provided that the issuance of shares therein has been
approved by the Company’s Board and provided that the issuance of such shares is primarily for
purposes other than the raising of additional capital through an equity financing; and

(Ht) for purposes of the adjustment required by Section
5(h)(i) only, any Common Stock or Convertible Securities issued in any transaction in which
exemption from the adjustment required pursuant to Section 5(h)(@) hereof is approved by the
holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the outstanding Series Preferred.

References to Common Stock in the subsections of this clause (v) above shall
mean all shares of Common Stock issued by the Company or deemed to be issued pursuant to
this Section 5(h). The “Effective Price” of Additional Shares of Common Stock shall mean the
quotient determined by dividing the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock issued
or sold, or deemed to have been issued or sold by the Company under this Section S(h), into the
Aggregate Consideration received, or deemed to have been received by the Company for such
issue under this Section 5(h), for such Additional Shares of Common Stock.

In the event that the Company issues or sells, or is deemed to have issued or sold,
Additional Shares of Common Stock in a Qualifying Additional Issuance (the “First Additional
Issuance”), then in the event that the Company issues or sells, or is deemed to have issued or
sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock in a Qualifying Additional Issuance other than the
First Additional Issuance pursuant to the same instruments as the First Additional Issuance (a
“Subsequent Additional Issuance”), then and in each such case upon a Subsequent Additional
Issuance the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be reduced to the Series
Preferred Conversion Price that would have been in effect had the First Additional Issuance and
each Subsequent Additional Issuance all occurred on the closing date of the First Additional
Issuance.

(i) Certificate of Adjustment. In each case of an adjustment or
readjustment of any Series Preferred Conversion Price for the number of shares of Common
Stock or other securities issuable upon conversion of any series of Series Preferred or Series E-]
Preferred Stock, if such Series Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock is then convertible
pursuant to this Section 5, the Company, at its expense, shall compute such adjustment or
readjustment in accordance with the provisions hereof and prepare a certificate showing such
adjustment or readjustment, and shall mail such certificate, by first class mail, postage prepaid, to
each registered holder of such series of Series Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock at the
holder’s address as shown in the Company’s books. The certificate shall set forth such
adjustment or readjustment, showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or
readjustment is based, including a statement of (i) the consideration received or deemed to be

(j) Notices of Record Date. Upon (i) any taking by the Company of a
record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof
who are entitled to receive any dividend or other distribution, or (ii) any Acquisition (as defined
in Section4) or other capital reorganization of the Company, any reclassification or
recapitalization of the capital stock of the Company, any merger or consolidation of the
Company with or into any other corporation, or any Asset T ransfer (as defined in Section 4), or
any voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company, the
Company shall mail to each holder of Series Preferred and Series E-1 Preferred Stock at Jeast ten

dividend or distribution and a description of such dividend or distribution, (B) the date on which
any such Acquisition, reorganization, reclassification, transfer, consolidation, merger, Asset
Transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to become effective, and (C) the date,
if any, that is to be fixed as to when the holders of record of Common Stock (or other securities)
shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock (or other securities) for securities or
other property deliverable upon such Acquisition, reorganization, reclassification, transfer,
consolidation, merger, Asset Transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up.

(k) Automatic Conversion.

(i) Each share of Series Preferred and Series F-1 Preferred
Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock, based on the then-effective
applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price, (A) (1) in the case of the Series D Preferred Stock
and Junior Preferred, at any time upon the affirmative clection of the holders of at least sixty-six
and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the then outstanding shares of the Series D Preferred Stock
and Junior Preferred, voting together on an as-if-converted basis, (2) in the case of the Series E
Preferred Stock, at any time upon the affirmative election of the holders of a majority of the then
outstanding shares of the Series E Preferred Stock, and (3) in the case of the Series E-] Preferred
Stock, at any time upon the affirmative election of the holders of a majority of the then
outstanding shares of the Series E-1 Preferred Stock, or (B) immediately upon the closing of a
firmly underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, covering the offer and sale of Common Stock for the
account of the Company in which: (1) the per share price is at least three times (3x) the Original
Issue Price of the Series E Preferred Stock (as adjusted for stock splits, dividends,
recapitalizations and the like after the filing date hereof); (2) the aggregate net cash proceeds to
the Company (after underwriting discounts, commissions and fees) are at Jeast $30,000,000; and
(3) the Company’s Common Stock is traded on a recognized major stock exchange or the
Nasdaq Stock Market. Upon such automatic conversion, any declared and unpaid dividends
shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of Section 5(d).

(ii) Upon the occurrence of cither of the events specified in
Section 5(k)(i) above, the outstanding shares of Series Preferred and Series E-1 Preferred Stock
shall be converted automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and
whether or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Company or its
transfer agent; provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to issue certificates
evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion unless the certificates

18.

1044160 v3/HN
evidencing such shares of Series Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock are either delivered to
the Company or its transfer agent as provided below, or the holder notifies the Company or its
transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an
agreement satisfactory to the Company to indemnify the Company from any loss incurred by it
in connection with such certificates. Upon the occurrence of such automatic conversion of the
Series Preferred and Series E-1 Preferred Stock, the holders of Series Preferred and Series E-1
Preferred Stock shall surrender the certificates representing such shares at the office of the
Company or any transfer agent for the Series Preferred or Series E-t Preferred Stock.
Thereupon, there shall be issued and delivered to such holder promptly at such office and in its
name as shown on such surrendered certificate or certificates, a certificate or certificates for the
number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Series Preferred or Series E-1
Preferred Stock surrendered were convertible on the date on which such automatic conversion
occurred, and any declared and unpaid dividends shall be paid in accordance with the provisions
of Section 5(d).

(l) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be
issued upon conversion of Series Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock. All shares of Common
Stock (including fractions thereof) issuable upon conversion of more than one share of Series
Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock by a holder thereof shall be aggregated for purposes of
determining whether the conversion would result in the issuance of any fractional share. If, after
the aforementioned aggregation, the conversion would result in the issuance of any fractional
share, the Company shall, in lieu of issuing any fractional share, pay cash equal to the product of
such fraction multiplied by the Common Stock’s fair market value (as determined by the Board)
on the date of conversion.

(m)Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Company
shal} at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common
Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Series Preferred and
Series E-1 Preferred Stock, such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to
time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of the Series Preferred and
Series E-1 Preferred Stock. If at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of
Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of
the Series Preferred and Series E-1 Preferred Stock, the Company will take such corporate action
as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares
of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.

(n) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Section 5 shall
be in writing and shall be deemed effectively given: (i) upon personal delivery to the party to be
notified, (ii) when sent by confirmed electronic mail or facsimile if sent during normal business
hours of the recipient; if not, then on the next business day, (iii) five (5) days after having been
sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or (iv) one (1) day
after deposit with a nationally recognized overnight courier, specifying next day delivery, with
verification of receipt. All notices shall be addressed to each holder of record at the address of
such holder appearing on the books of the Company.

(0) Payment of Taxes. The Company will pay all taxes (other than taxes
based upon income) and other governmental charges that may be imposed with respect to the

19.

1044160 v3/1IN
issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of shares of Series Preferred or
Series E-1 Preferred Stock, excluding any tax or other charge imposed in connection with any
transfer involved in the issue and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that
in which the shares of Series Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock so converted were
registered.

6. No REISSUANCE OF SERIES PREFERRED.

No shares or shares of Series Preferred or Series E-1 Preferred Stock acquired by
the Company by reason of redemption, purchase, conversion or otherwise shall be reissued.

V.

A. The liability of the directors of the Company for monetary damages shall be
eliminated to the fullest extent under applicable law. If the Delaware General Corporation Law

action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a
director of the Company shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the
DGCL as so amended.

B. The Company is authorized to provide indemnification of agents (as defined in
Section 317 of the CGCL and, as the case may be, other applicable) for breach of duty to the
Company and its stockholders through bylaw provisions or through agreements with the agents,
or through stockholder resolutions, or otherwise, in excess of the indemnification and
advancement otherwise permitted by Section 317 of the CGCL and Section 145 of the DGCL,
subject, at any time or times that the Company is subject to Section 2115(b) of the CGCL, to the
limits on such excess indemnification set forth in Section 204 of the CGCL.

Cc. Any repeal or modification of this Article V shall only be prospective and shall
not affect the rights under this Article V in effect at the time of the alleged occurrence of any
action or omission to act giving rise to liability.

VI.

For the management of the business and for the conduct of the aftairs of the Company,
and in further definition, limitation and regulation of the powers of the Company, of its directors
and of its stockholders or any class thereof, as the case may be, it is further provided that:

A. The management of the business and the conduct of the affairs of the Company
shall be vested in its Board. The number of directors which shall constitute the whole Board
shall be fixed by the Board in the manner provided in the Bylaws, subject to any restrictions
which may be set forth in this Restated Certificate.

B. Subject to Section D.2(b) of Article [V, the Board of Directors is expressly
empowered to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Company. The stockholders shal] also
have the power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Company; provided however, that,
in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the Company required by
law or by this Certificate of Incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a

20.

1044160 v3/IIN
majority of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the
Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class,
shall be required to adopt, amend or repeal any provision of the Bylaws of the Company.

Cc. The directors of the Company need not be elected by written ballot unless the
Bylaws so provide.

Vu.

In the event that a director of the Company who is also a partner or employee of an entity
that is a holder of Series Preferred and that is in the business of investing and reinvesting in other
entities (each, a “Fund”) acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter in such person’s
capacity as a partner or employee of the Fund and that may be a corporate opportunity for both
the Company and such Fund (a “Corporate Opportunity”), then the Company, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, renounces any interest or expectancy of the Company in, or in being
offered an opportunity to participate in, the Corporate Opportunity; provided, however, that such
director acts in good faith and such Corporate Opportunity was not offered to such person in his
or her capacity as a director of the Company.
