Rights”):

option of the holder thereof, at any time and from time to time, and without the payment of
additional consideration by the holder thereof, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable
shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing $0.50 (subject to appropriate adjustment
for stock splits, stock dividends, combinations and other similar recapitalizations affecting such
shares) by the Series A Conversion Price (as defined below) in effect at the time of conversion.
The “Series A Conversion Price” is currently $0.172856. Such Series A Conversion Price, and

-8-

USI DOCS $639303¥4
the rate at which shares of Series A Preferred Stock may be converted into shares of Common
Stock, shall be subject to adjustment as provided below.

(ii) | Each share of Series B Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the
option of the holder thereof, at any time and from time to time, and without the payment of
additional consideration by the holder thereof, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable
shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Series B Original Purchase Price by
the Series B Conversion Price (as defined below) in effect at the time of conversion. The “Series
B Conversion Price” shall initially be equal to the Series B Original Purchase Price. Such initial
Series B Conversion Price, and the rate at which shares of Series B Preferred Stock may be
converted into shares of Common Stock, shall be subject to adjustment as provided below.

(iii) In the event of a notice of redemption of any shares of Series A
Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 6 hereof, the Conversion Rights
of the shares designated for redemption shall terminate at the close of business on the last full
day preceding the date fixed for redemption, unless the redemption price is not paid on such
redemption date, in which case the Conversion Rights for such shares shall continue until such
price is paid in full. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation,
the Conversion Rights shall terminate at the close of business on the last full day preceding the
date fixed for the payment of any such amounts distributable on such event to the holders of
Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, as the case may be. In the event of such a
redemption or liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the Corporation shall provide to each
holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, as the case may be,
notice of such redemption or liquidation, dissolution or winding up, which notice shall (i) be sent
at least 15 days prior to the termination of the Conversion Rights and (ii) state the amount per
share of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, as the case may be, that will be
paid or distributed on such redemption or liquidation, dissolution or winding up, as the case may
be.

(b) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon
conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional
shares to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to
such fraction multiplied by the then effective Series A Conversion Price or Series B Conversion
Price, as the case may be.

(b) Mechanics of Conversion.

(i) In order for a holder of Preferred Stock to convert shares of
Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the certificate or
certificates for such shares of Preferred Stock, at the office of the transfer agent for the Preferred
Stock (or at the principal office of the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer
agent), together with written notice that such holder elects to convert all or any number of the
shares of the Preferred Stock represented by such certificate or certificates. Such notice shall
state such holder’s name or the names of the nominees in which such holder wishes the
certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued. If required by the
Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by a

-9-

USI DOCS 56393034
written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly
executed by the registered holder or his or its attorney duly authorized in writing. The date of
receipt of such certificates and notice by the transfer agent (or by the Corporation if the
Corporation serves as its own transfer agent) shall be the conversion date (“Conversion Date”),
and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the shares represented by such
certificate shall be deemed to be outstanding of record as of such date. The Corporation shall, as
soon as practicable after the Conversion Date, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of
Preferred Stock, or to his or its nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of
Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled, together with cash in lieu of any fraction
of a share.

(ii) | The Corporation shall at all times when the Preferred Stock shall
be outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued stock, for the
purpose of effecting the conversion of the Preferred Stock, such number of its duly authorized
shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all
outstanding Preferred Stock. Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment
reducing the Series A Conversion Price or Series B Conversion Price below the then par value of
the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the applicable series of Preferred
Stock, the Corporation will take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be
necessary in order that the Corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock at such adjusted Series A Conversion Price or Series B
Conversion Price, as the case may be.

(iit) | Upon any such conversion, no adjustment to the Series A
Conversion Price or Series B Conversion Price, as the case may be, shall be made for any
accrued but unpaid or declared but unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock or Series B
Preferred Stock, as the case may be, surrendered for conversion or on the Common Stock
delivered upon conversion.

(iv) All shares of Preferred Stock which shall have been surrendered
for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding, and all rights
with respect to such shares, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and to vote, shall
immediately cease and terminate on the Conversion Date, except only the right of the holders
thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor and payment of any dividends
declared but unpaid thereon. Any shares of Preferred Stock so converted shall be retired and
cancelled and shall not be reissued, and the Corporation (without the need for stockholder action)
may from time to time take such appropriate action as may be necessary to reduce the authorized
number of shares of such series of Preferred Stock accordingly.

(v) | The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and other similar taxes
that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon
conversion of shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4. The Corporation shall not,
however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in
the issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in which the
shares of Preferred Stock so converted were registered, and no such issuance or delivery shall be
made unless and until the person or entity requesting such issuance has paid to the Corporation

such Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities and Options therefor, the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to be Additional Shares of Common
Stock issued as of the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as

original issuance or upon a revision of its terms) in an adjustment to the Series A Conversion
Price or Series B Conversion Price pursuant to the terms of Subsection 4(c)(iv) below, the
Series A Conversion Price and/or Series B Conversion Price, as the case may be, shall be
readjusted to such Series A Conversion Price or Series B Conversion Price, as the case may be,

based. The Corporation shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the written request at
any time of any holder of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, furnish or cause
to be furnished to such holder a certificate setting forth (i) the Series A Conversion Price and the
Series B Conversion Price then in effect, and (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the
amount, if any, of other securities, cash or property which then would be received upon the
conversion of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock.

(i) Notice of Record Date. In the event:

(i) the Corporation shall take a record of the holders of its Common
Stock (or other stock or securities at the time issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred
Stock or Series B Preferred Stock) for the purpose of entitling or enabling them to receive any
dividend or other distribution, or to receive any right to subscribe for or purchase any shares of
stock of any class or any other securities, or to receive any other right; or

(ii) ‘of any capital reorganization of the Corporation, any
reclassification of the Common Stock of the Corporation, any consolidation or merger of the
Corporation with or into another corporation (other than a consolidation or merger in which the
Corporation is the surviving entity and its Common Stock is not converted into or exchanged for
any other securities or property), or any transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Corporation; or

(iii) | of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-
up of the Corporation,

then, and in each such case, the Corporation will send or cause to be sent to the holders of
the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock a notice specifying, as the case may
be, (i) the record date for such dividend, distribution or right, and the amount and character of
such dividend, distribution or right, or (ii) the effective date on which such reorganization,
reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is to take
place, and the time, if any is to be fixed, as of which the holders of record of Common Stock (or
such other stock or securities at the time issuable upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred
Stock or Series B Preferred Stock) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock
(or such other stock or securities) for securities or other property deliverable upon such
reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or
winding-up. Such notice shall be sent at Jeast 10 days prior to the record date or effective date
for the event specified in such notice.

amended, resulting in at least $40,000,000 of gross proceeds to the Corporation (a “Qualifying
Public Offering”) or (B) a date agreed to in writing by the holders of a majority of the then
outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock (each, a “Series A Mandatory Conversion Date”),
(i) all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into shares
of Common Stock, at the then effective conversion rate and (ii) such shares may not be reissued
by the Corporation as Series A Preferred Stock. Upon the earlier of (A) the closing of a
Qualifying Public Offering or (B) a date agreed to in writing by the holders of at least the
Applicable B Preferred Percentage of the then outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock
(each, a “Series B Mandatory Conversion Date” and, together with a Series A Mandatory
Conversion Date, a “Mandatory Conversion Date”), (i) all outstanding shares of Series B
Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock, at the then
effective conversion rate and (ii) such shares may not be reissued by the Corporation as Series B

Section 2.2 of the Stock Purchase Agreement and (B) a holder of Series B Preferred Stock as of
the Series B Original Issue Date (a “Preferred Holder’) has the right and the obligation, pursuant
to Sections 2.1 and 2.2 of the Stock Purchase Agreement, to purchase a certain number of
Additional Series B Shares (the “Required Shares’) at such Subsequent Closing, and (C) such
Preferred Holder does not purchase, together with its Affiliated Parties (as defined in and
allowed by Section 1.2 of the Stock Purchase Agreement) its Required Shares (other than as a
result of the failure of the Corporation to comply with the terms of the Stock Purchase
Agreement) (such holder being referred to herein as a “Non-Participating Holder’) in violation
of Section 2.2 of the Stock Purchase Agreement, then all shares of Series B Preferred Stock held
by a Non-Participating Holder shall automatically and without further action on the part of such
holder be converted concurrently with the consummation of the Mandatory Subsequent Closing
(the “Special Mandatory Conversion Date”) into shares of Common Stock, at the then effective
conversion rate.

(c) All holders of record of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be given
written notice of the Series A Mandatory Conversion Date and the place designated for
mandatory conversion of all such shares of Series A Mandatory Conversion Date and the place
designated for mandatory conversion of all such shares of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to
this Section 5; and all holders of record of shares of Series B Preferred Stock, or, in the case of
Section 5(b), all Non-Participating Holders, shall be given written notice of the Series B
Mandatory Conversion Date or Special Mandatory Conversion Date, as the case may be, and the
place designated for mandatory conversion of all such shares of Series B Preferred Stock subject
to conversion pursuant to this Section 5. Such notice need not be given in advance of the
occurrence of such Mandatory Conversion Date or, if applicable, the Special Mandatory
Conversion Date. Such notice shall be sent by first class or registered mail, postage prepaid, or
given by electronic communication in compliance with the provisions of the Delaware General
Corporation Law, to each record holder of Series A Preferred Stock and/or Series B Preferred
Stock, as the case may be or, in the case of Section 5(b), all Non-Participating Holders. Upon

Date, unless such holder has exercised his right to convert such shares as provided in Section 4
hereof, shall surrender the certificate or certificates representing such shares to the Corporation,

with respect to such shares shall forthwith after the Redemption Date terminate, except only the
right of the holders to receive the Redemption Price without interest upon surrender of their

other rights granted to the holders of Preferred Stock.

7. Waiver. Any of the rights of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock set forth

shares of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding except where the consent or vote of the
holders of a greater number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock is required to take action under
any provision contained herein, in which case, such greater number of shares of Series A
Preferred Stock shall also be required to waive such rights. Any of the rights of the holders of
Series B Preferred Stock set forth herein may be waived by the affirmative consent or vote of the
holders of at least the Applicable B Preferred Percentage of the shares of Series B Preferred
Stock then outstanding except where the consent or vote of the holders of a greater number of
shares of Series B Preferred Stock is required to take action under any provision contained
herein, in which case, such greater number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall also be
required to waive such rights.

Corporation shall not be entitled, without the consent of Indemnitee, to assume the defense of
any claim brought by or in the right of the Corporation or as to which counsel for Indemnitee
shall have reasonably made the conclusion provided for in clause (ii) above. The Corporation
shall not be required to indemnify Indemnitee under this Article SEVENTH for any amounts
paid in settlement of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation effected without its written
consent. The Corporation shall not settle any action, suit, proceeding or investigation in any
manner which would impose any penalty or limitation on Indemnitee without Indemnitee’s
written consent. Neither the Corporation nor Indemnitee will unreasonably withhold or delay its
consent to any proposed settlement.

5. Advance of Expenses. Subject to the provisions of Section 6 of this Article
SEVENTH, in the event that the Corporation does not assume the defense pursuant to Section 4
of this Article SEVENTH of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation of which the
Corporation receives notice under this Article, any expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred
by or on behalf of an Indemnitee in defending an action, suit, proceeding or investigation or any
appeal therefrom shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such
matter; provided, however, that the payment of such expenses incurred by or on behalf of
Indemnitee in advance of the final disposition of such matter shall be made only upon receipt of
an undertaking by or on behalf of Indemnitee to repay all amounts so advanced in the event that
it shall ultimately be determined that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the
Corporation as authorized in this Article; and further provided that no such advancement of
expenses shall be made under this Article SEVENTH if it is determined (in the manner described
in Section 6) that (i) Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably
believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, or (ii) with respect to
any criminal action or proceeding, Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct
was unlawful. Such undertaking shall be accepted without reference to the financial ability of
Indemnitee to make such repayment.

6. Procedure for Indemnification. In order to obtain indemnification or
advancement of expenses pursuant to Section 1, 2, 3 or 5 of this Article SEVENTH, an
Indemnitee shall submit to the Corporation a written request. Any such advancement of
expenses shall be made promptly, and in any event within 30 days after receipt by the
Corporation of the written request of Indemnitee, unless the Corporation determines within such
30-day period that Indemnitee did not meet the applicable standard of conduct set forth in
Section 1, 2 or 5 of this Article SEVENTH, as the case may be. Any such indemnification,
unless ordered by a court, shall be made with respect to requests under Section | or 2 only as
authorized in the specific case upon a determination by the Corporation that the indemnification
of Indemnitee is proper because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth
in Section 1 or 2, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made in each instance (a) by a
majority vote of the directors of the Corporation consisting of persons who are not at that time
parties to the action, suit or proceeding in question (“disinterested directors”), whether or not a
quorum, (b) by a committee of disinterested directors designated by majority vote of
disinterested directors, whether or not a quorum, (c) if there are no disinterested directors, or if
the disinterested directors so direct, by independent legal counsel (who may, to the extent
permitted by law, be regular legal counsel to the Corporation) in a written opinion, or (d) by the
stockholders of the Corporation.

- 26 -

USIDOCS 5639303v4
7. Remedies. The right to indemnification or advancement of expenses as granted
by this Article shall be enforceable by Indemnitee in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Neither the failure of the Corporation to have made a determination prior to the commencement
of such action that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met
the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Corporation pursuant to
Section 6 of this Article SEVENTH that Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of
conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met the
applicable standard of conduct. Indemnitee’s expenses (including attorneys’ fees) reasonably
incurred in connection with successfully establishing Indemnitee’s right to indemnification, in
whole or in part, in any such proceeding shall also be indemnified by the Corporation.

8. Limitations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article, except as
set forth in Section 7 of this Article SEVENTH, the Corporation shall not indemnify an
Indemnitee pursuant to this Article SEVENTH in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof)
initiated by such Indemnitee unless the initiation thereof was approved by the Board of Directors
of the Corporation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article, the Corporation
shall not indemnify an Indemnitee to the extent such Indemnitee is reimbursed from the proceeds
of insurance, and in the event the Corporation makes any indemnification payments to an
Indemnitee and such Indemnitee is subsequently reimbursed from the proceeds of insurance,
Indemnitee shall promptly refund such indemnification payments to the Corporation to the extent
of such insurance reimbursement.

9. Subsequent Amendment. No amendment, termination or repeal of this Article or
of the relevant provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or any other
applicable laws shall affect or diminish in any way the rights of any Indemnitee to
indemnification under the provisions hereof with respect to any action, suit, proceeding or
investigation arising out of or relating to any actions, transactions or facts occurring prior to the
final adoption of such amendment, termination or repeal.

10. Other Rights. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by this
Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnitee seeking
indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any law (common or
statutory), agreement or vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to
action in Indemnitee’s official capacity and as to action in any other capacity while holding
office for the Corporation, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director
or officer, and shall inure to the benefit of the estate, heirs, executors and administrators of
Indemnitee. Nothing contained in this Article shall be deemed to prohibit, and the Corporation is
specifically authorized to enter into, agreements with officers and directors providing
indemnification rights and procedures different from those set forth in this Article. In addition,
the Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by its Board of Directors, grant
indemnification rights to other employees or agents of the Corporation or other persons serving
the Corporation and such rights may be equivalent to, or greater or less than, those set forth in
this Article.

11. Partial Indemnification. If an Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this
Article to indemnification by the Corporation for some or a portion of the expenses (including
