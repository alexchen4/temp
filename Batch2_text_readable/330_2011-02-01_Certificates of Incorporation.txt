available therefor, prior and in preference to any declaration or payment of any dividend on the
Common Stock of the Company, at the rate of (a) $0.0412 per annum for each share of Series A
Preferred, (b) $0.0688 per annum for each share of Series B Preferred, (c) $0.0191 per annum for

shall accrue to holders of Preferred Stock unless declared by the Board of Directors. No dividends
or other distributions shall be made with respect to the Common Stock, other than dividends payable

Preferred Stock is paid.

2. Liquidation Preference.

(a) The Series C Preferred. In the event of any Liquidation (defined below) of this
Corporation, either voluntary or involuntary, the holders of Series C Preferred shall be entitled to
receive, prior and in preference to any distribution of any of the assets or surplus funds of the
Corporation to the holders of the Series B-2 Preferred, Series B Preferred, Series A Preferred, and
the Common Stock, an amount equal to $0.1839 per share for each share of Series C Preferred then
held by them (as adjusted for any stock dividends, stock splits, recapitalizations, combinations,
consolidations, or the like) plus an amount equal to any declared but unpaid dividends on the
Series C Preferred (the “Series C Preference”). If upon a Liquidation, the assets shall be insufficient
to pay the holders of the Series C Preferred the full Series C Preference, the holders of the Series C
Preferred shall share ratably in any distribution of assets according to the respective amounts which
would be payable in respect of the shares held by them upon such distribution if all amounts payable
on or with respect to said shares were paid in full.

(b) The Junior Preferred. Subject to the rights of the Series C Preferred as set forth in
clause (a) above, in the event of any Liquidation (defined below) of this Corporation, either
voluntary or involuntary, the holders of Series B-2 Preferred, the Series B Preferred and the Series A
Preferred (collectively, the “Junior Preferred”) shall be entitled to receive, prior and in preference to
any distribution of any of the assets or surplus funds of the Corporation to the holders of the

per share for each share of Series A Preferred then held by them (each as adjusted for any stock
dividends, stock splits, recapitalizations, combinations, consolidations, or the like) plus an amount
equal to any declared but unpaid dividends on such shares (the “Junior Preferred Preference”). If
upon a Liquidation, the assets shall be insufficient to pay the holders of the Junior Preferred the full
Junior Preferred Preference, the holders of the Junior Preferred shall share ratably in any distribution
of assets according to the respective amounts which would be payable in respect of the shares held

by them upon such distribution if all amounts payable on or with respect to said shares were paid in
full.

(c) Preferred Stock and Common Stock. Upon the completion of the distributions
required by Sections 2(a) and (b) above, the remaining assets of the Corporation available for
distribution to stockholders shall be distributed among the holders of the Preferred Stock and the
holders of the Common Stock, pro rata based on the number of shares of Common Stock (on an as
converted basis) held by each.

(d) “Liquidation” shall mean (A) a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of this
Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary; (B) a sale, lease, license or other transfer of all or
substantially all of this Corporation’s assets or the exclusive license or lease of substantially all of its
intellectual property; (C)a sale, transfer or exchange of 50% or more of this Corporation’s
outstanding stock in one transaction or a series of related transactions, which, if issued at the same
time, would constitute a transfer of 50% or more of the outstanding voting power of this Corporation
or (D) a consolidation, merger or reorganization of this Corporation with or into any other entity if
this Corporation’s shareholders do not control a majority of the outstanding voting securities of such
consolidated, merged or reorganized entity; provided, however, that any event described in (A), (B),
(C) or (D) above shall not be deemed to be a Liquidation under this Section 2 in the event that the
holders of at least two-thirds of the Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, determine that such
action should not be deemed a Liquidation.

(e) Any securities to be delivered to the holders of Preferred Stock pursuant to
Section 2(a), (b) or (c) above shall be valued as follows:

(i) Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar restrictions
on free marketability:

(1) If traded on a securities exchange the value shall be deemed to be
the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange over the 30-day period ending
three (3) days prior to the closing;

(2) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be deemed to be
the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever are applicable) over the 30-day period
ending three (3) days prior to the closing; and

(3) If there is no active public market, the value shall be the fair
market value thereof, as determined by the Corporation.

(ii) The method of valuation of securities subject to investment letter or
other restrictions on free marketability shall be to make an appropriate discount from the market
value determined as above in subsections 2(e)(i){1), (2) or (3) to reflect the approximate fair market
value thereof, as mutually determined by the Corporation and (1) the holders of a majority of the
voting power of all then outstanding shares of the Series C Preferred, in the case of securities to be
delivered solely to the holders of Series C Preferred, and (2) the holders of a majority of the voting
power of all then outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred and Series B-2
Preferred, voting as a separate class, in the case of securities to be delivered to such holders of
Preferred Stock.

(f) In the event the requirements of Section2 are not complied with, the
Corporation shall forthwith either:

(i) — cause the closing of the applicable transaction to be postponed until
such time as the requirements of this Section 2 have been complied with, or

(ii) | cancel such transaction, in which event the rights, preferences and
privileges of the holders of the Preferred Stock shall revert to and be the same as such rights,
preferences and privileges existing immediately prior to the date of the first notice referred to in

_ Section 3(h) hereof.

(g) As authorized by Section 402.5(c) of the California Corporations Code, the
provisions of Sections 502 and 503 of the California Corporations Code shall not apply with respect

consultants of the Corporation or its subsidiaries upon termination of their employment or services
pursuant to agreement providing for the right of said repurchase.

3. Conversion.

The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as follows (the
“Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the
option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share at the office of the
Corporation or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be
convertible into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is
determined by dividing the Conversion Price (as defined with respect to each series of the Preferred
Stock in Section 3(b) and as may be adjusted pursuant to the operation of Section 3(d)(ii)) per share
then in effect for that series of Preferred Stock into the per share Conversion Value (as hereinafter
defined with respect to each series of Preferred Stock),

The Conversion Price per share of Series C Preferred shall be initially $0.1839, and
the per share Conversion Value of Series C Preferred shall be $0.1839. The Conversion Price per
share of Series B-2 Preferred shall be initially $0.2391, and the per share Conversion Value of
Series B-2 Preferred shall be $0.2391. The Conversion Price per share of Series B Preferred shall be
initially $0.8597, and the per share Conversion Value of Series B Preferred shall be $0.8597. The
Conversion Price per share of Series A Preferred shall be initially $0.515, and the per share
Conversion Value of Series A Preferred shall be $0.515. The Conversion Price of each series of
Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided below. The number of
shares of Common Stock to which a share of Preferred Stock is convertible is hereinafter referred to
as the Conversion Rate of such share.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be
converted into shares of Common Stock at the then effective Conversion Rate for the respective
series of Preferred Stock upon the earlier of (A) the date specified by written consent or agreement
of the holders of at least two-thirds of the then-outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock voting as a
separate class, or (B) the closing of a firm commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, covering the offer and
sale of Common Stock for the account of the Corporation with an offering price to the public of not
less than $4.00 (subject to arithmetic adjustment in the event of any stock splits, stock dividends,
combinations of shares or other such events relating to the Common Stock after the date hereof) and
an aggregate offering price of not less than $25,000,000. In the event of the automatic conversion of
the Preferred Stock upon a public offering as aforesaid, the person(s) entitled to receive the Common
Stock issuable upon such conversion of the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted
such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of the sale of securities in such public
offering.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be
issued upon conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder
would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to the fair value of such fraction.
Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into full shares of
Common Stock and to receive certificates therefor, he sha!l surrender the certificate or certificates
therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for the Preferred
Stock, and shall give written notice to the Corporation at such office that he elects to convert the
same. In the event of an automatic conversion pursuant to Section 3(b), the outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically without any further action by the holders of such
shares and whether or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation
or its transfer agent; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue
certificates with respect to shares of Common Stock issuable upon such automatic conversion unless
the certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are either delivered to the Corporation or
its transfer agent as provided above, or the holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that
such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the
‘Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such
certificates. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after such delivery, or such agreement and
indemnification in the case of a lost certificate, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of
Preferred Stock, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which
such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid and a check payable to the holder in the amount of any cash
amounts payable as the result of a conversion into fractional shares of Common Stock. Such
conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date
of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted; in the case of automatic
conversion pursuant to subsection 3{b)(A), on the date requisite consent or agreement of the
minimum required percentage of holders shall have been obtained; or, in the case of automatic
conversion pursuant to subsection 3(b)(B), immediately prior to the closing of the public offering.
The person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such
conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of
Common Stock on such date. ,

(1) Adjustment _of Series C Conversion Price. In the event this
Corporation shall issue Additional Shares of Common Stock after the Original Issue Date of the

Series C Preferred without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the then current
Conversion Price of the Series C Preferred, then in such event, the then current Conversion Price of
the Series C Preferred shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price determined by
multiplying the then current Conversion Price of the Series C Preferred by a fraction, the numerator
of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such
issue plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration received by the
Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued would purchase
at such then current Conversion Price of the Series C Preferred; and the denominator of which shall
be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the
number of such Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued; and provided further that, for the

Corporation shall issue Additional Shares of Common Stock after the Original Issue Date of the

Series B-2 Preferred without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the then current
Conversion Price of the Series B-2 Preferred, then in such event, the then current Conversion Price
of the Series B-2 Preferred shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price determined by
multiplying the then current Conversion Price of the Series B-2 Preferred by a fraction, the
numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior
to such issue plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration
received by the Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued
would purchase at such then current Conversion Price of the Series B-2 Preferred; and the
denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to such issue plus the number of such Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued; and
provided further that, for the purposes of this Section 3(d)(ii), all shares of Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of outstanding Preferred Stock and the exercise and/or conversion of any other
outstanding Convertible Securities and all outstanding Options shall be deemed to be outstanding.

consideration or for a consideration per share less than the then current Conversion Price of the
Series B Preferred, then in such event, the then current Conversion Price of the Series B Preferred
shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price determined by multiplying the then current
Conversion Price of the Series B Preferred by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number
of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of shares of
Common Stock which the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for the total number
of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued would purchase at such then current Conversion
Price of the Series B Preferred; and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of such Additional
Shares of Common Stock so issued; and provided further that, for the purposes of this
Section 3(d)(ii), all shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of outstanding Preferred
Stock and the exercise and/or conversion of any other outstanding Convertible Securities and all

Corporation shall issue Additional Shares of Common Stock after the after the Original Issue Date

without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the then current Conversion Price of
the Series A Preferred, then in such event, the then current Conversion Price of the Series A
Preferred shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price determined by multiplying the
then current Conversion Price of the Series A Preferred by a fraction, the numerator of which shall
be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the
number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation
for the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued would purchase at such then
current Conversion Price of the Series A Preferred; and the denominator of which shall be the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of
such Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued; and provided further that, for the purposes of
this Section 3(d)(ii), all shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of outstanding Preferred
Stock and the exercise and/or conversion of any other outstanding Convertible Securities and all
outstanding Options shall be deemed to be outstanding.

consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional Shares of Common Stock
shal! be computed as follows:

(1) Cash and Property: Such consideration shall:
(A) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the aggregate
amount of cash received by the Corporation excluding amounts paid or payable for accrued interest
or accrued dividends;

(B) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith by the Board
of Directors; and

(C) in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock are issued
in conjunction with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for consideration
which covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in
clauses (A) and (B) above, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(2) Options and Convertible Securities. In the case of issuance of
options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common Stock, or securities by their terms convertible
into or exchangeable for Common Stock, the following provisions shall apply for all purposes of
Section 3(d):

(A)The aggregate maximum number of shares of Common
Stock deliverable upon exercise of such options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common
Stock shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such options or rights were issued and for a
consideration per share equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in
subparagraph 3(d)(iii)(1)), if any, received by the Corporation upon the issuance of each such option
or right plus the exercise price provided in each such option or right for the Common Stock or
Preferred Stock covered thereby.

(B) The aggregate maximum number of shares of Common
Stock deliverable upon conversion or in exchange for such convertible or exchangeable securities or
upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or exchangeable
securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof shall be deemed to have been issued at the
time such securities were issued or such options or rights were issued and for a consideration per
share equal to the consideration, if any, received by the Corporation for each share or unit of any
such securities and related options or rights (excluding any cash received on account of accrued
interest or accrued dividends), plus the .additional consideration, if any, to be received by the
Corporation upon the conversion or exchange of each share or unit of such securities or the exercise
of any related options or rights (the consideration in each case to be determined in the manner
provided in subparagraph 3(d)(iii)(1)).

(C)In the event of any change in the number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon exercise of such
options or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such convertible or exchangeable
securities, including, but not limited to, a change resulting from the antidilution provisions thereof,
the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or
computed using such options, rights or securities, shall be recomputed to reflect such change, but no
further adjustment shall be made for the actual issuance of Common Stock or any payment of such
consideration upon the exercise of any such options or rights or the conversion or exchange of such
securities.

(D)Upon the expiration of any such options or rights, the
termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options or rights
related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Conversion Price of each series of
Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, rights or
securities, shall be recomputed to reflect the issuance of only the number of shares of Common
Stock (and convertible or exchangeable securities which remain in effect) actually issued upon the
conversion or exchange of such securities or upon the exercise of the options or rights related to such
securities.

(E) The number of shares of Common Stock deemed issued
and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to subparagraphs 3(d)(iii)(2)(A) and (B) shall
be appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or expiration of the type described in
either subparagraph 3(d){iii)(2)(C) or (D).

(iv) Adjustments for Subdivisions, Combinations or Stock Dividends of
Common Stock. In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided (by stock

split, or otherwise), at any time after the Original Issue Date into a greater number of shares of
Common Stock, or the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date
shall declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in Common Stock, the Conversion
Price then in effect for each series of Preferred Stock shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of
such subdivision or stock dividend, be proportionately decreased based on the ratio of (i) the number
of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such subdivision or -stock dividend to
(ii) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such subdivision or
stock dividend. In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined or
consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, the
Conversion Price then in effect for each series of Preferred Stock shall, concurrently with the
effectiveness of such combination or consolidation, be proportionately increased on the same basis.

(v) Adjustments for Other Distributions. In the event the Corporation at
any time or from time to time makes, or fixes a record date for the determination of holders of
Common Stock entitled to receive any distribution payable in (i) securities of the Corporation (other
than shares of Common Stock and other than as otherwise adjusted in this Section 3 or as otherwise
provided in Section 1), or (ii) evidences of indebtedness issued by the Corporation or other persons,
or (iii) assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred to in
subparagraph 3(d){iii)(2), then and in each such event provision shall be made so that the holders of
the Preferred Stock shall receive upon conversion thereof, in addition to the number of shares of
Common Stock receivable thereupon, the amount of such distribution which they would have
received had their Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event and
had they thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to and including the date of
conversion, retained such securities receivable by them as aforesaid during such period, subject to all
other adjustments called for during such period under this Section 3 with respect to the rights of the
holders of the Preferred Stock.
(vi) Adjustments for Recapitalization, Reclassification, Exchange and
Substitution. If at any time or from time to time the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the

Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of any other class or
classes of stock, whether by recapitalization, capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise
(other than a subdivision, combination of shares or merger or sale of assets transaction provided for
above or in Section 2(c)), the Conversion Rate then in effect for each series of Preferred Stock shall,
concurrently with the effectiveness of such recapitalization, reorganization or reclassification, be
proportionately adjusted such that the respective series of Preferred Stock shall be convertible into,
in lieu of the number of shares of Common Stock which the holders thereof would otherwise have
been entitled to receive, a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock equivalent to the
number of shares of Common Stock that would have been subject to receipt by the holders upon
conversion of such series of Preferred Stock immediately before that change. In addition, to the
extent applicable in any reorganization or recapitalization, provision shall be made so that the
holders of the Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of the Preferred
Stock the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the Corporation or otherwise,
to which a holder of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled on such
reorganization or recapitalization.

(e) No Impairment. The Corporation will not, without the appropriate vote of the
shareholders under the General Corporation Law or Section 6 of this Article V, the Corporation will
not, by amendment of its Articles of Incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets,
consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or
seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed
hereunder by the Corporation but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the
provisions of this Section 3 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in
order to protect the Conversion Rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock against impairment.

(f) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Conversion Price or the Conversion Rate of any series of Preferred Stock
pursuant to this Section 3, the Corporation at its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or
readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to each holder of such series of
Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the
facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon the written
request at any time of any holder of a series of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to
such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and readjustments, (ii) the Conversion
Price and the Conversion Rate at the time in effect and applicable to such series, and (iii) the number
of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be
received upon the conversion of such series.

(g) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at all
times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock solely
for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock such number of its
shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock, in addition to such other remedies as shall be available to the holder of
such Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of
counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such
number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes.

(h) Notices of Record Date. In the event that the Corporation shall propose at any
time:

(i) to declare any dividend or distribution upon its Common Stock,
whether in cash, property, stock or other securities, whether or not a regular cash dividend and
whether or not out of earnings or earned surplus;

(ii) to offer for subscription pro rata to the holders of any class or series of
its stock any additional shares of stock of any class or series or other rights;

(iii) to effect any reclassification or recapitalization of its capital stock
outstanding involving a change in the outstanding capital stock; or

the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled thereto and the amount and character of such
dividend, distribution or right); and

(2) in the case of the matters referred to in (iii) and (iv) above, at least
20 days’ prior written notice of the date when the same shall take place (and specifying the date on
which the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to exchange their Common Stock for securities
or other property deliverable upon the occurrence of such event or the record date for the
determination of such holders if such record date is earlier).

Each such written notice shall be delivered personally or given by first class mail, postage
prepaid, addressed to the holders of each series of Preferred Stock at the address for each such holder
as shown on the books of this Corporation.

4. Redemption.

(a) Redemption of Preferred Stock. The Corporation shall not have the right to
call or redeem at any time all or any shares of the Preferred Stock. The holders of the Preferred
Stock shall have redemption rights as follows (the “Redemption Rights”):

(i) At any time after January 1, 2016, upon the election of the holders of
at least two-thirds of the then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock (the “Redemption Request”),
the Corporation shail redeem all issued, outstanding and unconverted shares of Preferred Stock at the
applicable Redemption Price (as defined below) as provided herein from any source of funds legally

12
available therefor. Subject to the election of the holders of the Preferred Stock provided above, the
Corporation shall redeem all shares of Preferred Stock outstanding as of the date of such election
upon payment of the Redemption Price for the shares so redeemed no later than 45 days after the
receipt of a Redemption Request (the “Redemption Date’). If the funds of the Corporation legally
available for redemption of the Preferred Stock on the Redemption Date are insufficient to redeem
the total number of outstanding shares of Preferred Stock on the Redemption Date, those funds
which are legally available will be used to redeem the maximum number of shares of the Preferred
Stock ratably among the holders of the Preferred Stock. If, and only if, no funds or insufficient
funds are available to the Corporation at the Redemption Date to meet the Corporation’s redemption
obligations pursuant to this Section 4(a)(i), then the Corporation’s obligations to redeem shares of
the Preferred Stock shall continue and at any time thereafter when additional funds of the
Corporation are legally available for the redemption of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation, within
ten (10) business days of the availability of such funds, shall use such funds to redeem the balance of
the shares which the Corporation has become obligated to redeem on the Redemption Date but
which it has not redeemed. The shares of the Preferred Stock that have not been redeemed shall
continue to be entitled to the dividend, conversion and other rights, preferences, privileges and
restrictions applicable to each series of Preferred Stock.

(ii) The redemption price for each share of the Series C Preferred
repurchased (the “Series C Redemption Price”) shall be equal to $0.1839 for each such share to be
redeemed (as adjusted for any stock dividends, stocks splits, recapitalizations, combinations,
consolidations, or the like, with respect to the Series C Preferred). The redemption price for each
share of the Series B-2 Preferred repurchased (the “Series B-2 Redemption Price’) shall be equal to
$0.2391 for each such share to be redeemed (as adjusted for any stock dividends, stocks splits,
recapitalizations, combinations, consolidations, or the like, with respect to the Series B-2 Preferred).
The redemption price for each share of the Series B Preferred repurchased (the “Series B
Redemption Price”) shall be equal to $0.8597 for each such share to be redeemed (as adjusted for
any stock dividends, stocks splits, recapitalizations, combinations, consolidations, or the like, with
respect to the Series B Preferred). The redemption price for each share of the Series A Preferred
repurchased (the “Series A Redemption Price”) shall be equal to $0.515 for each such share to be
redeemed (as adjusted for any stock dividends, stocks splits, recapitalizations, combinations,
consolidations, or the like, with respect to the Series A Preferred).

(iii) Within ten (10) business days of the Corporation’s receipt of a
Redemption Request, the Corporation will mail written notice to each holder of record of shares of
each series of Preferred Stock, at the address for such holder as it appears on the stock transfer books
of the Corporation, notifying such holder of the redemption, specifying the Redemption Date upon
which the Corporation shall satisfy the Redemption Request, the applicable Redemption Price, the
place at which payment may be obtained and the date on which such holder’s conversion rights as to
such shares terminate, and calling upon such holder to surrender to the Corporation, in the manner
and at the place designated, its certificate or certificates representing the shares to be redeemed (the
“Redemption Notice”). On or after the Redemption Date, each holder of shares to be redeemed shall
surrender to the Corporation the certificate or certificates representing such shares to be redeemed, in
the manner and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice, and thereupon the Redemption
Price of such shares shall be payable to the order of the person whose name appears on such
certificate or certificates as the owner thereof. In the event that less than all of the shares represented

13
by any such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed
shares.

(iv) From and after the Redemption Date, unless there shall have been a
default in payment of the Redemption Price, all rights of the holders of the shares thereupon
redeemed, as holders of shares of Preferred Stock (except the right to receive the Redemption Price
upon surrender of their certificate or certificates), shall cease with respect to such shares, and such
shares shall not thereafter be transferred on the books of this Corporation or be deemed to be
outstanding for any purpose whatsoever. The shares not redeemed shall remain outstanding and
entitled to all the rights and preferences provided herein.

(v) If there has been a default in the payment of the Redemption Price,
then during the period from the Redemption Date through the date on which such shares of Preferred
Stock are redeemed, the Redemption Price of such shares not redeemed will bear interest at a per-
annum rate equal to the lower of 8% or the highest rate permitted by law.

5. Noting Rights.

(a) Vote Other Than for Directors. Holders of each series of Preferred Stock shall
have full voting rights and powers equal to the voting rights and powers of the holders of Common
Stock, and shall vote together with the holders of Common Stock and not as a separate class except
as otherwise required by law, or provided herein. Except as otherwise required by law or by
Section 6 hereof, the holder of each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding shall have one
vote and the holder of each share of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to the number of votes equal to
the number of shares of Common Stock into which such share of Preferred Stock could be converted
at the record date for determination of the shareholders entitled to vote on such matters, or, if no
such record date is established, at the date such vote is taken or any written consent of shareholders
is solicited, such votes to be counted together with all other shares of stock of the Corporation
having general voting power and not separately as a class. Fractional votes by the holders of
Preferred Stock shall not, however, be permitted and any fractional voting rights shall (after
aggregating all shares into which shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder could be converted)
be rounded to the nearest whole number. Holders of Common Stock and Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to notice of any shareholders’ meeting in accordance with the Bylaws of the Corporation.

(b) Voting for Directors. The Board of Directors shall consist of seven (7)
members. At any time as any shares of Series B-2 Preferred or Series B Preferred remain
outstanding, the holders of the shares of Series B-2 Preferred and Series B Preferred, voting together
as a separate class, shall be entitled to elect one (1) director (the “Series B Director”). At any time as
any shares of Series A Preferred remain outstanding, the holders of the shares of Series A Preferred,
voting separately as a series, shall be entitled to elect two (2) directors (the “Series A Directors”).
The holders of Common Stock, voting as a separate class, shall be entitled to elect two (2) directors
(the “Common Directors”). The holders of the Preferred Stock and Common Stock, voting together
as a separate class, shall be entitled to elect two (2) directors (the “Mutual Directors”). A vacancy
on the Board of Directors occurring because of the death, resignation or removal of a Series B
Director shall be filled by the vote or written consent of the holders of the Series B Preferred and
Series B-2 Preferred, voting together as a separate class. A vacancy occurring because of the death,
resignation or removal of the Series A Director shall be filled by the vote or written consent of the
holders of the Series A Preferred, voting separately as a series. A vacancy on the Board of Directors
occurring because of the death, resignation or removal of a director elected by the holders of
Common Stock voting as a separate class shall be filled by the vote or written consent of the holders
of the Common Stock. A vacancy on the Board of Directors occurring because of the death,
resignation or removal of a Mutual Director shall be filled by the vote or written consent of the
holders of the Preferred Stock and Common Stock, voting together as a separate class. The Series B
Director, a Series A Director, a Common Director, or a Mutual Director may be removed from the
Board of Directors with or without cause by the vote or consent of the holders of the outstanding
class or series with voting power entitled to elfect him in accordance with this Section 5(b) and the
California Corporations Code.

(c) Voting for Directors in the Event of Default under Section 4. In the event that
the Corporation is in default of its obligations to redeem the Preferred Stock, the holders of a

majority of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to elect the Common Directors until such time as the
Company is no longer in default pursuant to Section 4. Thereafter, the Common Directors will be
elected as provided in Section 5(b) above.
