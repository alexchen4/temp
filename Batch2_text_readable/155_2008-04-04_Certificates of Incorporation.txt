1. General. The voting, dividend and liquidation rights of the holders of the
Common Stock are subject to and qualified by the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock as
may be designated by the Board of Directors upon any issuance of the Preferred Stock of any
series.

2. Voting. The holders of the Common Stock are entitled to one vote for
each share of Common Stock held at ali meetings of stockholders (and actions by written consent
of the stockholders in lieu of meetings) with respect to any and ail matters presented to the
stockholders of the Corporation for their action or consideration. There shall be no cumulative
voting.

3. Number of Shares. The number of authorized shares of Common Stock
may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by
the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote,
irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.

4, Dividends. Dividends may be declared and paid on the Common Stock
from funds lawfully available therefor if, as and when determined by the Board of Directors and
subject to any preferential dividend rights of any then outstanding Preferred Stock.

5. Liquidation. Upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary (a “Liquidation Event”), the holders of Common
Stock will be entitled to receive all assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its
stockholders, subject to any preferential rights of any then outstanding Preferred Stock.

B. PREFERRED STOCK.

1. Dividends. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive,
in preference to the holders of the Junior Stock (as defined in Section B.2(a) below), out of funds
legally available therefor, if, as and when declared by the Corporation’s Board of Directors, cash
dividends annually at a rate equal to the greater of (i) eight percent (8%) per annum multiplied
by the original purchase price per share paid to the Corporation by the initial holder of such
share, and (ii) the dividends payable on the Common Stock into which such shares of Preferred
Stock would have been converted, had such shares of Preferred Stock been converted into shares
of Common Stock on the record date for the dividend (the “Dividend Rate”). Such dividends
shall not be cumulative. Unless all declared dividends on the Preferred Stock shall have been

W02-WEST:2M11\400662340.4 -2-
paid or a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart, no dividend shall be paid or declared,
and no distribution shall be made, on any Junior Stock and no redemption of any Junior Stock
shall occur. Except as otherwise provided herein, if at any time the Corporation pays less than
the total amount of dividends then declared but unpaid with respect to the Preferred Stock, such
payment shall be distributed ratably among the holders of Preferred Stock in proportion to the
payment each such holder would receive if the full amount of such dividend were paid. Upon
any conversion of shares of Preferred Stock, al] rights to such preferential dividends (whether or
not declared) on such shares shal! terminate.

The original purchase price per share for each series of Preferred Stock for the purpose of
calculating dividends, and for all other purposes of this Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, is as follows (with all per share figures subject to appropriate adjustment in the
event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization affecting
such shares): $0.75 per share for the Series A Preferred Stock (the “Series A Original Purchase
Price”), $1.175 per share for the Series B Preferred Stock (the “Series B Original Purchase
Price”), $1.38 per share for the Series B-l Preferred Stock (the “Series B-1 Original Purchase
Price”), $3.066 per share for the Series C Preferred Stock (the “Series C Original Purchase
Price”), $7.3469 per share for the Series D Preferred Stock (the “Series D Original Purchase
Price”), $5.4002 per share for the Series E Preferred Stock (the “Series E Original Purchase
Price”) and a price per share for the Series F Preferred Stock equal to the Series F Share Price
(the “Series F Original Purchase Price”), as such amount is calculated pursuant to the Securities
Purchase Agreement dated December 29, 2006 between the Company and the original purchaser
of Series D Preferred Stock (as amended from time to time, the “Securities Purchase
Agreement’’).

The “Series D/E Average Price” is the weighted average of the Series D Original
Purchase Price and the Series E Original Purchase Price calculated using the following formula
(rounded to the nearest hundredth of a cent): (D x Y) + (E x Z)/ D+ E, where D equals the
number of outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock, Y equals the Series D Original
Purchase Price, E equals the number of outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock, and Z
equals the Series E Original Purchase Price. As of the date hereof, the Series D/E Average Price
is $6.7395. Such figure is subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend,
stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization affecting the shares of Series D
Preferred Stock and/or the Series E Preferred Stock.

The “Series D/E/F Average Price” is the weighted average of the Series D Original
Purchase Price, the Series E Original Purchase Price and the Series F Original Purchase Price
calculated using the following formula (rounded to the nearest hundredth of a cent): (D x X) + (E
x Y)+ (F x Z)/D+E+F, where D equals the number of outstanding shares of Series D
Preferred Stock, X equals the Series D Original Purchase Price, E equals the number of
outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock, Y equals the Series E Original Purchase Price, F
equals the number of outstanding shares of Series F Preferred Stock, and Z equals the Series F
Original Purchase Price.

distribution (the “Current Distribution”) is to be made, the total amount available for the Current
Distribution will be cumulated with all prior distributions made in connection with the
Liquidation Event, and a calculation of the amount distributable to each stockholder will be
made as if the total cumulative amount had been paid in a single initial distribution, assuming for
purposes of such calculation that each series of Preferred Stock elected to convert such series of
Preferred Stock to Common Stock in a manner that would yield such series of Preferred Stock
the largest distribution. The amount allocated to each stockholder in such calculation is called
the stockholder’s “Cumulative Distribution.” In the Current Distribution, each stockholder will

stockholder is added to all prior distributions to such stockholder in connection with the
Liquidation Event, such stockholder will have received its Cumulative Distribution.

outstanding capital stock of the Corporation to a single entity or group of related entities in one
transaction or a series of transactions or the sale of all or substantially all the assets of the

W02-WEST:2MI1\400662340.4 -~8-
Corporation, such merger, consolidation, stock sale or asset sale shall be deemed to be a
liquidation of the Corporation and all consideration payable to the stockholders of the
Corporation (in case of a merger, consolidation or stock sale) or all consideration payable to the
Corporation, together with all other available assets of the Corporation (in case of an asset sale),

B.2(a) through 2(h) of this Article Fourth, unless the holders of at least fifty percent (50%) of the
then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock so elect not to treat such event as a liquidation of the
Corporation by giving written notice thereof to the Corporation at least three (3) days before the
effective date of such event. The Corporation shall promptly provide to the holders of shares of
Preferred Stock such information concerning the terms of such merger, consolidation, stock sale
or asset sale and the value of the assets of the Corporation as may reasonably be requested by the
holders of Preferred Stock in order to assist them in determining whether to make such an
election. The Corporation shall use its best efforts to amend the agreement or plan of merger or
consolidation to adjust the rate at which the shares of capital stock of the Corporation are
converted into or exchanged for cash, new securities or other property to give effect to Sections
B.2(a) through 2(h) of this Article Fourth. The amount deemed distributed to the holders of
Preferred Stock upon any such merger or consolidation shall be the cash or the value of the
property, rights or securities distributed to such holders by the acquiring person, firm or other
entity. The value of such property, rights or other securities shall be determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors of the Corporation and the holders of a majority of the Preferred Stock,
provided that if the property is securities that are traded on a securities exchange, the Nasdaq
Stock Market or over-the-counter, the value of the securities shall be deemed to be the average of
the closing prices (with respect to securities listed on a securities exchange or the Nasdaq Stock
Market) or the closing bid and asked prices (with respect to securities listed over-the-counter) of
the securities on such exchange or over-the-counter over the ten (10) day period ending three (3)

Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series B-1 Preferred Stock, Series C
Preferred Stock and Common Stock outstanding at the time of the Series D Acquisition shall be
entitled to be paid out of the assets and funds of the Corporation available for distribution to its

this subsection shall have the following meanings:

“Series A Catch-up Amount” = Catch-up Amount x Al x A2
TAIC
“Series B Catch-up Amount” = Catch-up Amount x B1 x B2
TAIC
“Series B-1 Catch-up Amount” = Catch-up Amount x B-1-1 x B-1-2
TAIC

Purchase Agreement or Escrow Agreement shall be distributed to the parties who held Series A
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series B-1 Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock
and Common Stock at the time of the Series D Acquisition in accordance with subsections (e),
(f), (g), (h) and (i) below. For purposes of such subsections, the term “Initial Calculation” means
the per share amount determined by dividing the assets and funds available for distribution to
such stockholders of the Corporation by the total number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding at the time of the Series D Acquisition (other than Series D Preferred Stock, Series E
Preferred Stock, Series F Preferred Stock or Common Stock issued upon conversion thereof)
calculated in all cases assuming conversion of Preferred Stock to Common Stock. “Total
Distributable Amount” means the assets and funds available for distribution to the Corporation’s
stockholders in connection with a Series D Acquisition (and includes the Initial Payments, the
Catch-up Amount and any amount deposited with the Paying Agent under the Merger
Agreement, Stock Purchase Agreement or Escrow Agreement). For purposes of allocating

distributions under this subsection (d) and subsections (e), (f}, (g), (h) and (i) below: (1) each
holder of a Company Stock Option shall be treated as owning the number of shares of Common
Stock with respect to which the Company Stock Option may be exercised; (2) the amounts
allocated to each such holder per share shall be reduced by the amount by which the applicable
Per Share Strike Price exceeds the Per Share Common Stock Closing Payment in accordance
with Section 2.1(c) of the Merger Agreement or in accordance with the Stock Purchase
Agreement; and (3) the aggregate amounts by which the allocations to holders of Company
Stock Options are reduced pursuant to clause (2) shall be treated as additional deposits with the
Paying Agent.

(e) If the Initial Calculation is greater than or equal to two times the
Series C Original Purchase Price, the Total Distributable Amount shall be distributed among the
holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series B-1 Preferred
Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Common Stock and any other class or series of stock entitled to
participate in liquidation distributions with the holders of Common Stock, pro rata based on the

subsection shall have the following meanings:

“Series A Acquisition Distribution Amount “ =TDAx Al x A2
TAIC
“Series B Acquisition Distribution Amount “ =TDAx Bl x B2
TAIC
“Series B-1 Acquisition Distribution Amount“ =TDAx B-1-1 x B-1-2
TAIC
“Series C Acquisition Distribution Amount “ =TDA x C1 x C2
TAIC

Thereafter, the remaining assets and funds of the Corporation available for distribution to its
stockholders shall be distributed among the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series
B Preferred Stock, Series B-1 Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Common Stock and any
other class or series of stock entitled to participate in liquidation distributions with the holders of

W02-WEST:2MH\400662340.4 -1i-
Common Stock, pro rata based on the number of shares of Common Stock held by each such
holder (assuming conversion into Common Stock of all such shares of Preferred Stock).

(g) Lf the Initial Calculation is (1) greater than or equal to two times
the Series A Original Purchase Price and (2) less than two times the Series C Original Purchase
Price, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall receive the Series A Acquisition
Distribution Amount, the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock shall receive the Series B
Acquisition Distribution Amount, the holders of the Series B-1 Preferred Stock shall receive the
Series B-1 Acquisition Distribution Amount and the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock shall
receive the Series C Acquisition Distribution Amount up to a maximum amount per share equal
to the Original Purchase Price per share for each series of Preferred Stock, distributed ratably
among the holders of each series of Preferred Stock, such that each holder of a share of a
particular series of Preferred Stock receives the same percentage of the applicable Acquisition
Distribution Amount for each share of such series,

Thereafter, any remaining assets and funds of the Corporation available for distribution to
its stockholders shall be distributed:

(x) first, among the holders of shares of Series A
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series B-1 Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock,
Common Stock and any other class or series of stock entitled to participate in liquidation
distributions with the holders of Common Stock, pro rata based on the number of shares of
Common Stock held by each such holder (assuming conversion into Common Stock of all such
shares of Preferred Stock); provided, that such amount collectively distributed among the holders
of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series B-1] Preferred Stock and Series C
Preferred Stock (the “Remaining Acquisition Amount”) shall be allocated as follows: the holders
of the Series A Preferred Stock shall receive the Series A Remaining Acquisition Amount, the
holders of the Series B Preferred Stock shall receive the Series B Remaining Acquisition
Amount, the holders of the Series B-1 Preferred Stock shall receive the Series B-1 Remaining
Acquisition Amount and the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock shall receive the Series C
Remaining Acquisition Amount, up to a maximum amount per share (including all amounts
received by a holder of a share of Preferred Stock pursuant to this subsection (g)) equal to two
times the Original Purchase Price per share for each shares of Preferred Stock, distributed ratably
among the holders of each series of Preferred Stock, such that each holder of a share of a
particular series of Preferred Stock receives the same percentage of the applicable Remaining
Acquisition Amount for each share of such series. The terms above in this subsection shall have
the following meanings:

“Series A Remaining Acquisition = Remaining Acquisition Amount x Al x A2
Amount” TAIC.
“Series B Remaining Acquisition = Remaining Acquisition Amount = x BI x B2
Amount TAIC
“Series B-1 Remaining Acquisition = Remaining Acquisition Amount x  B-I-1 x B-l-2
Amount” TAIC

W02-WEST:2MH\400662340.4 -12-
“Series C Remaining Acquisition = Remaining Acquisition Amount x C1 xC2
Amount” TAIC ~

(y) next, any remaining assets and funds of the Corporation
available for distribution to its stockholders shall be distributed among the holders of shares of
Common Stock and any other class or series of stock (excluding the Series A Preferred Stock,
Series B Preferred Stock, Series B-1 Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock) entitled to
participate in liquidation distributions with the holders of Common Stock, pro rata based on the
number of shares of Common Stock held by each (assuming conversion into Common Stock of
all such shares of any other class or series of stock).

(h) If upon a Liquidation Event, the remaining assets of the
Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders shall be insufficient to pay to each of
the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series B-1 Preferred Stock and
Series C Preferred Stock an amount at least equal to the Original Purchase Price per share of
such Preferred Stock, then the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall receive the Series A
Acquisition Distribution Amount, the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock shall receive the
Series B Acquisition Distribution Amount, the holders of the Series B-1 Preferred Stock shall
receive the Series B-1 Acquisition Distribution Amount and the holders of the Series C Preferred
Stock shall receive the Series C Acquisition Distribution Amount, distributed ratably among the
holders of each series of Preferred Stock, such that each holder of a share of a particular sertes of
Preferred Stock receives the same percentage of the applicable Acquisition Distribution Amount
for cach share of such series.

(i) Recognizing the fact that the amount distributable to the holders of
Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series B-t Preferred Stock and Series C
Preferred Stock in connection with a Series D Acquisition is anticipated to be paid in
installments, prior to the time a Current Distribution of any installment is to be made, the total
amount available for the Current Distribution will be cumulated with all prior distributions made
in connection with the Series D Acquisition (including distributions relating to the Initial
Payments and the Catch-up Amount), and a calculation of the amount distributable to each
stockholder will be made as if the total cumulative amount had been paid in a single initial
distribution, assuming for purposes of such calculation that the Series A Preferred Stock, Series
B Preferred Stock, Series B-1 Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock elected to convert
such series of Preferred Stock to Common Stock in a manner that would yield such series of
Preferred Stock the largest distribution. In the Current Distribution, each such stockholder will
receive an amount such that when the portion of the Current Distribution distributed to such
stockholder is added to all prior distributions to such stockholder in connection with the Series D
Acquisition, such stockholder will have received its Cumulative Distribution.

4, Voting.

(a) General. Each holder of outstanding shares of Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of whole shares of Common Stock
into which the shares of Preferred Stock held by such holder are then convertible (as adjusted
from time to time pursuant to Section B.5 hereof), at each meeting of stockholders of the
Corporation (and actions by written consent of the stockholders in lieu of meetings) with respect
to any and all matters presented to the stockholders of the Corporation for their action or

W02-WEST:2MH1\400662340.4 -13-
consideration. There shall be no cumulative voting. Except as provided by law, by the
provisions of Section B.8 hereof or by the provisions establishing any other series of preferred
stock, holders of Preferred Stock and of any other outstanding series of preferred stock shall vote
together with the holders of Common Stock as a single class.

(b) Size of Board of Directors. Unless increased or decreased in
accordance with Section 8(b)(i) hereof, the Board of Directors shail consist of nine (9) members,
who shall be elected as follows: .

(i) The holders of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single
class, shall be entitled to elect five (5) members of the Board of Directors.

shall be entitled to elect two (2) members of the Board of Directors.

(iii) The holders of Common Stock and Preferred Stock, voting
together as a single class, shali be entitled to elect two (2) members of the Board of Directors.

5. Optional Conversion.

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be
convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time and from time to time, and without
the payment of additional consideration by the holder thereof, into such number of fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Original Purchase Price
for the applicable series of Preferred Stock by its Conversion Price (as defined below) in effect at
the time of conversion. The initial “Conversion Price” shall be the Series A Original Purchase
Price for the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series B Original Purchase Price for the Series B
Preferred Stock, the Series B-1 Original Purchase Price for the Series B-1 Preferred Stock, the
Series C Original Purchase Price for the Series C Preferred Stock, the Series D Original Purchase
Price for the Series D Preferred Stock, the Series E Original Purchase Price for the Series E
Preferred Stock and, if shares of Scries F Preferred Stock have been issued, the Series F Original
Purchase Price for the Series F Preferred Stock.

In the event of a notice of redemption of any shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to
Section B.7 hereof, the conversion rights of the shares designated for redemption shall terminate
at the close of business on the fifth (5™) full day preceding the date fixed for redemption, unless
the redemption price is not paid when due, in which case the conversion rights for such shares
shall continue until such price is paid in full. In the event of a liquidation of the Corporation, the
conversion rights shall terminate at the close of business on the first (1°) full day immediately
preceding the date fixed for the payment of any amounts distributable on liquidation to the
holders of Preferred Stock.

(b) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shal! be
issued upon conversion of the Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the
holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay to such holder an amount equal to
such fraction multiplied by the fair market value of the Common Stock as determined in good
faith by the Corporation’s Board of Directors.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion.

W02-WEST:2Mi1\400662340.4 -14-
(i) If a holder of Preferred Stock elects to convert shares of
Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock pursuant to subsection (a) above, such holder shall
surrender the certificate or certificates for such shares of Preferred Stock at the principal office of
the Corporation together with written notice that such holder elects to convert all or any number
of the shares of the Preferred Stock represented by such certificate or certificates. Such notice
shall state such holder’s name or the names of the nominees in which such holder wishes the
certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued and the effective date of the
conversion (the “Conversion Date”), which may be any date within the sixty (60) day period
following the date on which such notice is received by the Corporation. If required by the
Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by a
written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly
executed by the registered holder or such holder’s attorney duly authorized in writing. The
converting holder shall be deemed to be the record holder of the resulting shares of Common
Stock on the Conversion Date and the Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after the
Conversion Date (and in any event within fifteen (15) business days), issue and deliver at such
office of such holder of Preferred Stock, or to such holder’s nominees, a certificate or certificates
for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled, together with
payment in lieu of any fraction of a share pursuant to Section B.5(b) above.

(ii) The Corporation shall at all times when the Preferred Stock
shall be outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued stock, for the
purpose of effecting the conversion of the Preferred Stock, such number of its duly authorized
shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all
outstanding Preferred Stock. Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment
reducing the Conversion Price below the then par value of the shares of Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation will, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary
in order that the Corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion Price.

(iii) Upon any such conversion, no adjustment to the
Conversion Price shall be made for any declared or accrued but unpaid dividends on the
Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion or on the Common Stock delivered upon conversion.

(iv) On the Conversion Date, all shares of Preferred Stock
which shall have been surrendered for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed
to be outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares, including the rights, if any, to receive
notices and to vote, shall immediately cease and terminate, except only the right of the holders
thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor and payment of any dividends
declared but unpaid thereon. Any shares of Preferred Stock so converted shall be retired and
cancelled and shall not be reissued, and the Corporation (without the need for stockholder action)
may from thereafter take such appropriate action as may be necessary to reduce the authorized
Preferred Stock accordingly.

(v) The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and other taxes
(other than taxes based on income) that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of
shares of Common Stock upon conversion of shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section
B.5. The Corporation shall not, however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in

W02-WEST:2M11\400662340.4 -15-
respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a
name other than that in which the shares of Preferred Stock so converted were registered, and no
such issuance or delivery shall be made unless and until the person or entity requesting such
issuance has paid to the Corporation the amount of any such tax or has established, to the
satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax has been paid.

(d) Adjustment for Dilution. If at any time after the date of the filing
of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware (the “Filing Date”), the Corporation shall issue any shares of Common Stock, or
shall issue any Common Stock Equivalents (as hereinafter defined), for a consideration per share
less than the Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to the
issuance of such Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents, the Conversion Price of such
series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall be decreased to
the amount determined in accordance with the following formula:

Conversion Price = (P1 x Q1) + (P2 x 02

QI + Q2

For purposes of the foregoing formula:

P1 = Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance.

Ql = Number of shares of Common Stock deemed outstanding (in accordance with
subparagraph (vi) below) immediately prior to such issuance.

P2 = Average price per share received by the Corporation upon such issuance
(determined in accordance with subparagraphs (iii) and (vi) below).

Q2 = Number of shares of Common Stock issucd or sold, or deemed to have been

issued or sold (in accordance with subparagraph (vi) below) upon such issuance.

For purposes of any adjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section B.5(d), the
following provisions shall be applicable:

(i) “Common Stock Equivalents” means any stock or security
convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock, including the Preferred
Stock, and any right, warrant or option to acquire Common Stock or any such convertible,
exercisable or exchangeable security, provided, that the term Common Stock Equivalents shall
not include any rights, warrants or options to acquire Common Stock where the exercise or
“strike” price, or other amount payable in connection with the exercise or exchange of such
security, exceeds the fair market value of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such

exercise.

(ii) The per share consideration for the sale or issuance of
Common Stock shall be the price per share received by the Corporation before payment of
commissions, discounts and other expenses. The value of any non-cash consideration received
or receivable upon the sale or issuance of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents shall be
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

W02-WEST-2MI1\400662340.4 - 16-
(iii) In the case of the sale or issuance of Common Stock
Equivalents, the per share consideration shall be determined by dividing the maximum number
of shares of Common Stock issuable with respect to such Common Stock Equivalents into the
aggregate consideration received by the Corporation upon the sale or issuance of such Common
Stock Equivalents plus the minimum aggregate amount of any additional consideration
receivable by the Corporation upon the conversion or exercise of such Common Stock
Equivalents. For the purpose of calculation, such maximum number of shares shall be assumed
to be issued on the earlier of the payment date or record date for a distribution of such Common
Stock Equivalents.

(iv) If any Common Stock Equivalents included in adjustments
under this Section B.5(d) expire or terminate without the Common Stock to which they related
having been issued, the Conversion Price shaJ] be readjusted to eliminate the effect of the
assumed issuance of such Common Stock. If any Common Stock Equivalents by their terms
provide for subsequent increases in the additional consideration payable for the related Common
Stock or for subsequent decreases in the number of shares of Common Stock obtainable, then,
upon any such increase or decrease, the Conversion Price shall be appropriately readjusted to the
extent such Common Stock Equivalents have not then expired or been exercised or converted.
The aggregate increase in the Conversion Price caused by all such readjustments shall not exceed
the decrease in Conversion Price made upon the issuance of the Common Stock Equivalents to
which such readjustments relates. If any Common Stock Equivalents by their terms provide for
subsequent decreases in the additional consideration payable for the related Common Stock or
for subsequent increases in the number of shares of Common Stock obtainable, then, upon any
such decrease or increase, the Conversion Price shall be appropriately adjusted to the extent such
Common Stock Equivalents have not then expired or been exercised or converted.

(v) In case the Corporation shall declare a dividend or make
any other distribution upon any stock of the Corporation payable in Common Stock or Common
Stock Equivalents, such Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents shall be deemed to have
been issued or sold without consideration as of the earlier of the related record or payment date.

(vi) | ‘The number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any
point in time shali include all shares then issuable or to become issuable pursuant to any
Common Stock Equivalent then issued or to be issued.

(vii) The following issuances of Common Stock or Common
Stock Equivalents shall be excluded from the adjustment of the Conversion Price under this
Section B.5(d): (1) any dividend or distribution on any Preferred Stock; (2) any stock for which
adjustment of the Conversion Price is made pursuant to Sections B.5(c), B.5(), B.5(g) or B.5(h)
below; (3) securities offered by the Corporation to the public in a Qualified Public Offering (as
defined in Section B.6(a) below); (4) securities reissued to directors, employees, or consultants
following the Corporation’s acquisition of such securities pursuant to restricted stock
arrangements with individuals who have terminated their relationship with the Corporation or
shares subject to options granted to individuals who have terminated their relationship with the
Corporation which are not exercised; (5) shares of Common Stock, or securities convertible into
or exercisable for such shares, issued pursuant to an agreement solely to acquire or license
technology (including without limitation sponsored research) by the Corporation or to a
collaborative partner of the Corporation in connection with a corporate partnering transaction, if

W02-WEST:2MH\400662340,4 ~17-
such agreement is approved by the Board of Directors; (6) securities issucd pursuant to any right
or agreement to the extent to which an adjustment was previously made to the Conversion Price
established by this Section B.5 with respect to the initial sale or grant by the Corporation of such
right or agreement; (7) all securities issued or issuable pursuant to warrants or options
outstanding on the Filing Date; (8) shares of Common Stock (“Option Shares”’) issued or issuable
upon exercise of stock options (“Options”) granted to directors, officers, employees and
consultants of the Corporation, which are approved by the non-employee members of the Board
of Directors, under the Corporation’s Amended and Restated 2002 Incentive and Non-Incentive
Stock Option Plan (the “Plan”) approved by the Board of Directors and adopted by the
stockholders, whether previously existing or granted after the Filing Date, each of which Options
has a per share exercise price that is not less than the per share fair market value of the Common
Stock on the date of the Option grant, and which number of Option Shares does not exceed the
greater of (x) 6,960,000 or (y) such higher number approved by the Board of Directors, which
approval must include the affirmative vote or consent of all of the directors elected solely by the
holders of Preferred Stock; (9) securities issued in connection with any acquisition approved by
the holders of fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding Preferred Stock of the Corporation; (10)
shares of Serics E Preferred Stock or Series F Preferred Stock issued pursuant to Section 2 of the
Securities Purchase Agreement; and (11) Common Stock issued upon conversion of the
Preferred Stock.

(e) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If the Corporation
shall at any time or trom time to time after the Filing Date effect a subdivision of the outstanding

Common Stock, the Conversion Price then in effect immediately before that subdivision shall be
proportionately decreased. If the Corporation shall at any time or from time to time after the
Filing Date effect a subdivision of the Preferred Stock, the Conversion Price with respect to the
Preferred Stock then in effect immediately before that subdivision shall be proportionately
increased. If the Corporation shall at any time or from time to time after the Filing Date combine
the outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price then in effect immediately before
the combination shall be proportionately increased. If the Corporation shall at any time or from
time to time after the Filing Date combine the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, the
Conversion Price with respect to the Preferred Stock then in effect immediately before the
combination shall be proportionately decreased. Any adjustment under this paragraph shall
become effective at the close of busincss on the date the subdivision or combination becomes
effective.

(f) Adjustment for Certain Dividends and Distributions. In the event

the Corporation at any time, or from time to time after the Filing Date shall make or issue, or fix
a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or
other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock, then, and in each such event,
the Conversion Price for the Preferred Stock then in effcct shall be decreased as of the time of
such issuance or, in the event such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business
on such record date, by multiplying the Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction:

(1) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares
of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance
or the close of business on such record date, and

W02-WEST:2M1i\400662340.4 -18-
(2) the denominator of which shall be the total number of
shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such
issuance or the close of business on such record date plus the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution;

provided, however, if such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend is not fully paid
or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the Conversion Price for the
Preferred Stock shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record date
and thereafter the Conversion Price for the Preferred Stock shall be adjusted pursuant to this
paragraph as of the time of actual payment of such dividends or distributions; and provided
further, however, that no such adjustment shall be made if the holders of Preferred Stock
simultaneously receive a dividend or other distribution of shares of Common Stock in a number
equal to the number of shares of Common Stock as they would have received if all outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock on the date of such cvent.

(2g) Adjustments for Other Dividends Distributions. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Filing Date shall make or issue or fix a
record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or
other distribution payable in securities of the Corporation other than shares of Common Stock,
then, and in each such ¢cvent, provision shall be made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock
shall receive upon conversion thereof, in addition to the number of shares of Common Stock
receivable thereupon, the amount of securities of the Corporation that they would have received
had the Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event and had
they thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to, and including, the conversion
date, retained such securities receivable by them as aforesaid during such period, giving
application to all adjustments called for during such period under this paragraph with respect to
the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock; and provided further, however, that no such
adjustment shall be made if the holders of Preferred Stock simultaneously receive a dividend or
other distribution of such securities in an amount equal to the amount of such securities as they
would have received if all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock had been converted into
Common Stock on the date of such event.

(h) Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange or Substitution. If the

Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same
or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by capital
reorganization, reclassification, or othcrwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares
or stock dividend provided for above, or a reorganization, merger, consolidation, or sale of assets
provided for below), then, and in each such event, the holder of each such share of Preferred
Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such share into the kind and amount of shares of
stock and other securities and property receivable upon such reorganization, reclassification, or
other change by holders of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of
Preferred Stock might have been converted immediately prior to such reorganization,
reclassification or change, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein.

(i) No Impairment. The Corporation will not, by amendment of its
Certificate of Incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation,
merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to
avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder

W02-WEST:2MI1\400662340.4 -19-
by the Corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the
provisions of this Section B.5 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or
appropriate in order to protect the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock pursuant to this
Section B.5 against impairment.

qj) Certificate _as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each
adjustment or readjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section B.5, the Corporation
at its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the
terms hereof and furnish to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such
adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or
readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon the written request at any time (but not more
than twice in any twelve (12) month period) of any holder of shares representing at least five
percent (5%) of the authorized number of shares of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be
furnished to such holder a similar certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and readjustments,
(ii) the Conversion Price then in effect, and (iii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the
amount, if any, of other property which then would be received upon the conversion of Preferred
Stock.

6. Mandatory Conversion.

(a) All outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall automatically be
converted into shares of Common Stock at the then effective Conversion Price upon the earlier to
occur of (i) the closing (the “Mandatory Conversion Date”) of the sale by the Corporation of
shares of Common Stock in a firm commitment, underwritten public offering pursuant to an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities
Act”), through a firm acceptable to the Board of Directors of the Corporation resulting in at least
$25,000,000 of gross proceeds to the Corporation (before deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and offering expenses) and a pre-money valuation of at least $150,000,000 (a
“Qualified Public Offering”), or (ii) upon the affirmative election of the holders of at least a
majority of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class, in
connection with the closing of a firm commitment, underwritten public offering pursuant to an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act, covering the offer and sale of Common
Stock for the account of the Corporation which is not a Qualified Public Offering. For purposes
of the preceding sentence, pre-money valuation shall be calculated by multiplying (x) the per
share offering price of the Corporation’s shares in the public offering (before deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses), by (y} the total number of
shares of Common Stock of the Corporation outstanding immediately before the closing of the
public offering, assuming conversion of then outstanding Preferred Stock, and including all other
convertible securities and Common Stock issuable upon exercise of all then outstanding options,
rights, and warrants.

(b) All holders of record of shares of Preferred Stock will be given ten
(10) business days prior written notice of the Mandatory Conversion Date and the place
designated for mandatory conversion of all such shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this
Section B.6. Such notice shall be sent both by facsimile transmission (if a facsimile number has
been provided and is operational) and by first-class or registered mail, postage prepaid, to each
record holder of Preferred Stock at such holder’s facsimile number and address last shown on the
records of the Corporation for the Preferred Stock. Upon receipt of such notice, each holder of

W02-WEST:2MI11\400662340.4 -20 -
shares of Preferred Stock shall surrender his, her or its certificate or certificates for all such
shares to the Corporation at the place designated in such notice, and shall thereafter receive
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to this Section B.6. On the Mandatory Conversion Date, all rights with respect to the Preferred
Stock so converted, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and vote, will terminate,
except only the rights of the holders thereof, upon surrender of their certificate or certificates
therefor, to receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which such
Preferred Stock has been converted. If so required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered
for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by written instrument or instruments of
transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or by
such holder’s attorney duly authorized in writing. As soon as practicable after the Mandatory
Conversion Date and the surrender of the certificate or certificates for Preferred Stock, the
Corporation shall cause to be issued and delivered to such holder a certificate or certificates for
the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable on such conversion in accordance with the
provisions hereof and cash as provided in Section B.5(b) in respect of any fraction of a share of
Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion.

(c) All certificates evidencing shares of Preferred Stock which are
required to be surrendered for conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof shall, from
and afier the Mandatory Conversion Date, be deemed to have been retired and cancelled and the
shares of Preferred Stock represented thereby converted into Common Stock for all purposes,
notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender such certificates on or
prior to such date. The Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate action (without the
need for stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized Preferred Stock
accordingly.

7. Redemption Event.

(a) The Corporation will, subject to the conditions set forth below,
including the possible extension of such date in accordance with this Section B.7(a), on
December 31, 2010 and on each of the first and second anniversaries thereof (each such date
being referred to hereinafter as a “Redemption Date”), upon receipt of written request(s) (an
“Initial Redemption Request”) for redemption not Jess than thirty (30) days prior to the
applicable Redemption Date from holders of at least a simple majority of the shares of Series A
Preferred Stock, making demand as a separate class, from holders of at least a simple majority of
the combined shares of Series B Preferred Stock and Series B-1 Preferred Stock, calculated as a
single class and making demand as a separate class, from holders of at least a simple majority of
the shares of Series C Preferred Stock, making demand as a separate class or from holders of at
least a simple majority of the combined shares of Series D Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred
Stock and Series F Preferred Stock, calculated as a single class and making demand as a separate
class (such demanding holders of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series
B-1 Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, or Series D Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred
Stock and Series F Preferred Stock, the “Initial Requesting Holders”), redeem from each
Requesting Holder (as defined in Section B.7(c) below), at the price per share equal to the price
per share paid to the Corporation for such shares by the initial holders thereof, which in the case
of the Series A Preferred Stock is the Series A Original Purchase Price, in the case of the Series
B Preferred Stock is the Series B Original Purchase Price, in the case of the Series B-1 Preferred
Stock is the Series B-1 Original Purchase Price, in the case of the Series C Preferred Stock is the

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) in no event shall the holders of any series of Preferred Stock
be entitled to have such shares redeemed by the Corporation pursuant to this Section B.7(a),
unless the approval of the holders of Preferred Stock under section B.8(a) is obtained, and (y) in
the cvent that the initial Redemption Date set forth above would fall during the Option Period (as

Preferred Stock on any Redemption Date are insufficient to redeem all of the number of shares of
Preferred Stock required under Section B.7(a) to be redeemed on such date, those funds which

Stock held by the holders of each series an amount equal to the total amount available for
redemption multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount originally paid to the
Corporation by the holders of such series for the Preferred Stock of that series they are seeking to
have redeemed, and the denominator of which is the amount originally paid to the Corporation
for all shares of Preferred Stock for which redemption in sought, and (y) each holder of a share
of a particular series of Preferred Stock will receive the same percentage of the applicable
Redemption Price for each share of such series. At any time thereafter when additional funds of
the Corporation become legally available for the redemption of Preferred Stock, such funds will
be used, at the end of the next succeeding fiscal quarter, to redeem the balance of the shares
which the Corporation was theretofore obligated to redeem, ratably on the basis set forth in the
preceding sentence.

Redemption Request, specifying the time, manner and place of redemption and the Redemption

records of the transfer agent therefor (or the records of the Corporation, if it serves as its own
transfer agent), not less than twenty (20) days prior to the applicable Redemption Date. Each
holder of record of Preferred Stock may elect to become, together with each of the Initial
Requesting Holders, one of the “Requesting Holders” on such Redemption Date by so indicating
in a written notice mailed to the Corporation, by first-class or registered mail, postage prepaid, at
least ten (10) days prior to the applicable Redemption Date. The Corporation will not redeem
shares of Preferred Stock held by any Requesting Holder unless it redeems shares of Preferred
Stock held by all Requesting Holders, with the allocation of available funds made in accordance
with Section B.7(b) above if the funds are not sufficient to redeem ail shares. Each Requesting
Holder shall surrender to the Corporation on the applicable Redemption Date the certificate(s)
representing the shares to be redeemed on such date, in the manner and at the place designated in
the Redemption Notice. Thereupon, the Redemption Price shall be paid to the order of each such
Requesting Holder and each certificate surrendered for redemption shall be canceled. In case
less than all Preferred Stock represented by any certificate is redeemed in any redemption
pursuant to this Section B.7, a new certificate will be issued representing the unredeemed
Preferred Stock without cost to the holder thereof.

(d) Unless there shall have been a default in payment of the applicable
Redemption Price, no share of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to any dividends declared after its
Redemption Date, and on such Redemption Date all rights of the holder of such share as a
stockholder of the Corporation by reason of the ownership of such share will cease, except the
right to receive the applicable Redemption Price of such share, without interest, upon
presentation and surrender of the certificate representing such share, and such share will not from
and after such Redemption Date be deemed to be outstanding.
