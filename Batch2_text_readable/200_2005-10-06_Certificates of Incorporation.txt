A. COMMON STOCK

l. General. The voting, dividend and liquidation rights of the holders of the
Common Stock are subject to and qualified by the rights, powers and preferences of the holders
of the Preferred Stock set forth herein and as may be designated by resolution of the Board of
Directors with respect to any series of Preferred Stock as authorized herein.

2. Voting. Except as otherwise required by law or this Certificate of Incorporation,
the holders of Common Stock will be entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be voted by
the stockholders of the Corporation. The number of authorized shares of Common Stock may be
increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the
affirmative vote of the holders of shares of stock of the Corporation representing a majority of
the votes represented by all outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote,
urespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the General Corporation Law.

B. PREFERRED STOCK
1. Dividends.

The Corporation shall not declare, pay or set aside any dividends on any other shares of
capital stock of the Corporation (other than dividends on shares of Common Stock payable in
shares of Common Stock) unless the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding
shall first receive, or simultaneously receive, a dividend on each outstanding share of Series A
Preferred Stock in an amount at least equal to that dividend per share of Series A Preferred Stock
as would equal the product of (1) the dividend payable on each share of such class or series
determined, if applicable, as if all such shares of such class or series had been converted into
Common Stock and (2) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of a
share of Series A Preferred Stock, in each case calculated on the record date for determination of
holders entitled to receive such dividend. Notwithstanding the forgoing, payment of any
dividend on capital stock of the Corporation is subject to Subsection 3(c)(i1i).

2. Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding-Up: Certain Mergers, Consolidations and
Asset Sales.

(a) Preferential Payments to Holders of Series A Preferred Stock. In the event of any
voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation (including a
Deemed Liquidation Event as defined below), the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock
then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid out of the assets available for distribution to its
stockholders, and before any payment shall be made to the holders of Common Stock or any
other class or series of stock (such Common Stock and other stock being collectively referred to
as “Junior Stock”), by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount per share equal to $1.3216
per share (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split,
combination or other similar recapitalization affecting such shares) (such amount, as so adjusted
from time to time, being hereinafter referred to as the “Series A Original Issue Price”), plus any
dividends declared but unpaid thereon. If upon any such liquidation, dissolution or winding-up
of the Corporation the assets available for distribution to its stockholders shall be insufficient to
pay the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock the full amount to which they shall be

B3077587.8 2
entitled, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall share ratably in any distribution
of the assets available for distribution in proportion to the respective amounts which would
otherwise be payable in respect of the shares held by them upon such distribution if all amounts
payable on or with respect to such shares were paid in full.

(b) Distribution of Remaining Assets. In the event of any voluntary or involuntary
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation (including a Deemed Liquidation
Event), after the payment of all preferential amounts required to be paid to the holders of shares
of Series A Preferred Stock, the remaining assets available for distribution to the Corporation’s
stockholders shall be distributed among the holders of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock,
Common Stock and any other series of capital stock entitled pursuant to the terms of this
Certificate of Incorporation to participate with the Common Stock in the distribution of such
remaining assets, pro rata based on the number of shares held by each such holder, treating for
this purpose all such securities as if they had been converted to Common Stock pursuant to the
terms of this Certificate of Incorporation immediately prior to such dissolution, liquidation or
winding-up of the Corporation. The aggregate amount which a holder of a share of Series A
Preferred Stock is entitled to receive under Subsections 2(a) and 2(b) is hereinafter referred to as
the “Series A Liquidation Amount.”

(c) Deemed Liquidation Events.

(i) The following events shall be deemed to be a liquidation of the
Corporation for purposes of this Section 2, unless the holders of at least 70% of the Series A
Preferred Stock then outstanding consenting or voting as a separate class (the “Required
Holders”) elect otherwise by written notice given to the Corporation at least 10 business days
prior to the effective date of any such event (any such event, unless such an election is made, is
referred to herein as a “Deemed Liquidation Event”):

(A) a merger or consolidation in which
(1) the Corporation is a constituent party or

(I) a subsidiary of the Corporation is a constituent party
and the Corporation issues shares of its capital stock
pursuant to such merger or consolidation,

except any such merger or consolidation involving the Corporation or a subsidiary in which the
shares of capital stock of the Corporation outstanding immediately prior to such merger or
consolidation continue to represent, or are converted or exchanged for shares of capital stock
which represent, immediately following such merger or consolidation, at least a majority, by
voting power, of the capital stock of (1) the surviving or resulting corporation or (2) if the
surviving or resulting corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary of another corporation
immediately following such merger or consolidation, the parent corporation of such surviving or
resulting corporation (provided that, for the purpose of this Subsection 2(c){i), all shares of
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Options (as defined below) outstanding immediately
prior to such merger or consolidation or upon conversion of Convertible Securities (as defined
below) outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation shall be deemed to be

B3077587.8 3
outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation and, if applicable, converted or
exchanged in such merger or consolidation on the same terms as the actual outstanding shares of
Common Stock are converted or exchanged); or

(B) _ the sale, lease, license, transfer or other disposition, in a
single transaction or series of related transactions, by the Corporation or any subsidiary of the
Corporation of all or substantially all the assets of the Corporation and its subsidiaries taken as a
whole, except where such sale, lease, license, transfer or other disposition is to a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Corporation.

(ii) The Corporation shall not have the power to effect any transaction
constituting a Deemed Liquidation Event pursuant to Subsection 2(c)(i A) above unless the
agreement or plan of merger or consolidation provides that the consideration payable to the
stockholders of the Corporation shall be allocated among the holders of capital stock of the
Corporation in accordance with Subsections 2(a) and 2(b) above.

(iii) In the event of a Deemed Liquidation Event pursuant to Subsection
2(¢)(A)CD or 2(c)(i)(B) above, if the Corporation does not effect a dissolution of the
Corporation under the General Corporation Law within 90 days after such Deemed Liquidation
Event, then (A) the Corporation shall deliver a written notice to each holder of Series A
Preferred Stock no later than the 90" day after the Deemed Liquidation Event advising such
holders of their right (and the requirements to be met to secure such ri ght) pursuant to the terms
of the following clause (B) to require the redemption of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock,
and (B) the Corporation shall, unless otherwise requested in writing by the Required Holders, use
the consideration received by the Corporation for such Deemed Liquidation Event (net of any
retained liabilities associated with the assets sold or technology licensed, as determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation) (the “Net Proceeds’), to redeem, to the
extent legally available therefor, on the 120" day after such Deemed Liquidation Event (the
“Liquidation Redemption Date”), all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock at a price
per share equal to the Series A Liquidation Amount. In the event of a redemption pursuant to the
preceding sentence, if the Net Proceeds are not sufficient to redeem all outstanding shares of
Series A Preferred Stock, or if the Corporation does not have sufficient lawfully available funds
to effect such redemption, the Corporation shall redeem a pro rata portion of each holder’s shares
of Series A Preferred Stock to the fullest extent of such Net Proceeds or such lawfully available
funds, as the case may be, and, where such redemption is limited by the amount of lawfully
available funds, the Corporation shall redeem the remaining shares to have been redeemed as
soon as practicable after the Corporation has funds legally available therefor. The provisions of
Subsections 6(b) through 6(f) below shall apply, with such necessary changes in the details
thereof as are necessitated by the context, to the redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock
pursuant to this Subsection 2(c)(iii). Prior to the distribution or redemption provided for in this
Subsection 2(c)(iii), the Corporation shall not expend or dissipate the consideration received for
such Deemed Liquidation Event, except to discharge expenses incurred in connection with such
Deemed Liquidation Event or in the ordinary course of business.

(iv) The amount deemed paid or distributed to the holders of capital
stock of the Corporation upon any such Deemed Liquidation Event shall be the cash or the value
of the property, rights or securities paid or distributed to such holders by the Corporation or the

B3077587.8 4
acquiring person, firm or other entity. The value of such property, rights or securities shall be
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

3. Voting.

(a) On any matter presented to the stockholders of the Corporation for their
action or consideration at any meeting of stockholders of the Corporation (or by written consent
of stockholders in lieu of meeting), each holder of outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to cast the number of votes equal to the number of whole shares of Common
Stock into which the shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by such holder are convertible as of
the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote on such matter. Except as provided
by law or in this Certificate of Incorporation, holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall vote
together with the holders of Common Stock as a single class.

(b) The holders of record of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock,
exclusively and as a separate class, shall be entitled to elect two directors of the Corporation (the
“Series A Directors”), and the holders of record of the shares of Common Stock, exclusively
and voting together as a single class, shall be entitled to elect one director of the Corporation.
Any director elected as provided in the preceding sentence may be removed without cause by,
and only by, the affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of the class or series of stock
entitled to elect such director or directors, given either at a special meeting of such stockholders
duly called for that purpose or pursuant to a written consent of stockholders. At any meeting
held for the purpose of electing a director, the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of the class or series entitled to elect such director shall
constitute a quorum for the purpose of electing such director. A vacancy in any directorship
filled by the holders of any class or series shall be filled only by vote or written consent in lieu of
a meeting of the holders of such class or series or by any remaining director or directors elected
by the holders of such class or series pursuant to this Subsection 3(b).

(c) At any time when shares of Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding,
except where the vote or written consent of the holders of a greater number of shares of the
Corporation is required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, and in addition to any other
vote required by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, without the written consent or
affirmative vote of the Required Holders, given in writing or by vote at a meeting, consenting or
voting (as the case may be) separately as a class, the Corporation shall not, either directly or by
amendment, merger, consolidation or otherwise:

(i) liquidate, dissolve or wind-up the business and affairs of the
Corporation, effect any Deemed Liquidation Event or any other merger, consolidation,
recapitalization or reorganization, or consent to any of the foregoing;

(ii) amend, alter, repeal or waive any provision of the Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws of the Corporation;

(ili) purchase or redeem or pay or declare any dividend or make any

distribution on, any shares of stock other than the Series A Preferred Stock as expressly
authorized herein, or permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to take any such action, except for

B3077587.8 5
dividends or other distributions payable on the Common Stock solely in the form of additional
shares of Common Stock and other than securities repurchased from former employees, officers,
directors, consultants or other persons who performed services for the Corporation or any
subsidiary in connection with the cessation of such employment or service at the lower of the
original purchase price or the then-current fair market value thereof or other than as approved by
a majority vote of the Board of Directors, which majority includes the affirmative vote of both
Series A Directors (a “Majority Directors Vote”);

(iv) increase or decrease the authorized number of directors
constituting the Board of Directors;

(v) grant any exclusive license other than in the ordinary course of
business;

(vi) make any significant change in the nature of the Corporation’s
principal business or the proposed nature of the Corporation’s business or enter into new lines of
business or exit the current line of business;

(vii) acquire, directly or indirectly (including through a subsidiary), all
or substantially all of the properties, assets or stock of any other company or entity;

(viii) authorize, designate or issue any class of stock, or create or
authorize any obligation or security convertible into shares of any class or series of stock unless
the same ranks junior to the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to the distribution of assets on
the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation and with respect to the payment of
dividends and redemption rights;

(ix) assume, guarantee, endorse or otherwise become directly or
contingently liable on, or permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to assume, guarantee, endorse
or otherwise become directly or contingently liable on (including, without limitation, liability by
way of agreement, contingent or otherwise, to purchase, to provide funds for payment, to supply
funds to or otherwise invest in the debtor or otherwise to assure the creditor against loss) any
indebtedness of any other person, firm or other entity, except for guaranties by endorsement of
negotiable instruments for deposit or collection in the ordinary course of business;

(x) make any non-business-related loan or advance to any officer,
director, employee, consultant or any other Person, or any subsidiary or other corporation,
partnership, or other entity;

(xi) grant any security interest in the assets of the Corporation or any
subsidiary of the Corporation other than in the ordinary course of business or in connection with
equipment lease financing approved by a majority of the Board of Directors;

(xii) consummate any transaction with any director, officer or employee
of the Corporation or any “associate” (as defined in Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Exchange
Act) of any such person except transactions made in the ordinary course of business and pursuant
to reasonable requirements of the Corporation’s business and upon fair and reasonable terms that
are approved by a majority of the Board of Directors; or

B3077587.8 6
(xii) create any subsidiary.

4. Optional Conversion.

The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall have conversion ri ghts as follows (the
“Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be
convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time and from time to time, and without
the payment of additional consideration by the holder thereof, into such number of fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing $1.3216 by the Series A
Conversion Price (as defined below) in effect at the time of conversion. The “Series A
Conversion Price” shall initially be equal to the Series A Original Issue Price. Such initial
Series A Conversion Price, and the rate at which shares of Series A Preferred Stock may be
converted into shares of Common Stock, shall be subject to adjustment as provided below.

In the event of a notice of redemption of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant
to Section 6 hereof, the Conversion Rights of the shares desi gnated for redemption shall
terminate at the close of business on the last full day preceding the date fixed for redemption,
unless the redemption price is not fully paid on such redemption date, in which case the
Conversion Rights for such shares shall continue until such price is paid in full. In the event of a
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation or a Deemed Liquidation Event, the
Conversion Rights shall terminate at the close of business on the last full day preceding the date
fixed for the payment of any such amounts distributable in such event to the holders of Series A
Preferred Stock.

(b) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued
upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the
holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction
multiplied by the fair market value of a share of Common Stock as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors of the Corporation. Whether or not fractional shares would be issuable
upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Series A
Preferred Stock the holder is at the time converting into Common Stock and the aggregate
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion.

(i) In order for a holder of Series A Preferred Stock to voluntarily
convert shares of Series A Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall
surrender the certificate or certificates for such shares of Series A Preferred Stock (or, if such
registered holder alleges that such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate
affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation
against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft
or destruction of such certificate), at the office of the transfer agent for the Series A Preferred
Stock (or at the principal office of the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer
agent), together with written notice that such holder elects to convert all or any number of the
shares of the Series A Preferred Stock represented by such certificate or certificates and, if

B3077587.8 7
applicable, any event on which such conversion is contingent. Such notice shall state such
holder’s name or the names of the nominees in which such holder wishes the certificate or
certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued. If required by the Corporation, certificates
surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or
instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered
holder or his, her or its attorney duly authorized in writing. The close of business on the date of
receipt by the transfer agent (or by the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer
agent) of such certificates (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement) and notice shall be the time
of conversion (the “Conversion Time”), and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of the shares represented by such certificate shall be deemed to be outstanding of
record as of such date. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after the Conversion Time,
issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Series A Preferred Stock, or to his, her or its
nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such
holder shall be entitled, together with cash in lieu of any fraction of a share and payment of any
dividends declared but unpaid on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock converted.

(ii) The Corporation shall at all times when the Series A Preferred
Stock shall be outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued stock,
for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, such number of its
duly authorized shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding Series A Preferred Stock: and if at any time the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all then outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall take such
corporate action as may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common
Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including, without
limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary
amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation. Before taking any action which would cause an
adjustment reducing the Series A Conversion Price below the then par value of the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Corporation will
take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the
Corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock
at such adjusted Series A Conversion Price.

(iii) All shares of Series A Preferred Stock which shall have been
surrendered for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and
all rights with respect to such shares, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and to vote,
shall immediately cease and terminate at the Conversion Time, except only the right of the
holders thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor and to receive payment
of any dividends declared but unpaid thereon. Any shares of Series A Preferred Stock so
converted shall be retired and cancelled and shall not be reissued as shares of such series, and the
Corporation (without the need for stockholder action) may from time to time take such
appropriate action as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Series A
Preferred Stock accordingly.

(iv) | Upon any such conversion, no adjustment to the Series A
Conversion Price shall be made for any declared but unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred
Stock surrendered for conversion or on the Common Stock delivered upon conversion.

B3077587.8 8
(v) The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and other similar taxes
that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon
conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4. The Corporation
shall not, however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer
involved in the issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in
which the shares of Series A Preferred Stock so converted were registered, and no such issuance
or delivery shall be made unless and until the person or entity requesting such issuance has paid
to the Corporation the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the
Corporation, that such tax has been paid.

(d) Adjustments to Series A Conversion Price for Diluting Issues.

(i) Special Definitions. For purposes of this Article Fourth, the
following definitions shall apply:

(A) “Option” shall mean rights, options or warrants to
subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire Common Stock or Convertible Securities.

(B) “Series A Original Issue Date” shall mean the date on
which the first share of Series A Preferred Stock was issued.

(C) “Convertible Securities” shall mean any evidences of
indebtedness, shares or other securities directly or indirectly convertible into or exchangeable for
Common Stock, including the Series A Preferred Stock, but excluding Options.

(D) “Additional Shares of Common Stock” shall mean all
shares of Common Stock issued (or, pursuant to Subsection 4(d)(iii) below, deemed to be issued)
by the Corporation after the Series A Original Issue Date, other than the following (“Exempted

(IV) up to 5,986,769 shares of Common Stock (subject
to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock
dividend, stock split, combination or other similar
recapitalization affecting such shares) issued or
deemed issued to employees or directors of, or
consultants to, the Corporation or any of its

B3077587.8 9
subsidiaries pursuant to the Corporation’s 2005
Stock Incentive Plan or a plan, agreement or
arrangement (or amendment thereto) approved by a
Majority Directors Vote, whether issued before or
after the Series A Original Issue Date; provided that
any Options for such shares that expire or terminate
unexercised or any restricted stock repurchased by
the Corporation at the lesser of cost or fair market
value shall not be counted toward such maximum
number unless and until such shares are regranted as
new stock grants (or as new Options) pursuant to
the terms of such plan; or

(V) shares of Common Stock (a) issued or issuable
solely in consideration for the acquisition (whether
by merger or otherwise) by the Corporation or any
subsidiary of all or substantially all of the capital
stock or assets of any other corporation or entity, (b)
issued or issuable solely in consideration for, or in
connection with, the grant by or to the Corporation
of marketing rights, distribution rights, license
rights or similar rights to proprietary technology,
whether of the Corporation to any other entity or of
any other entity to the Corporation, or (c) issued or
issuable in connection with an equipment financing,
line of credit or other lending arrangement;
provided, however, the issuance of such shares,
Options or Convertible Securities pursuant to (a),
(b) and (c) above is approved by a Majority
Directors Vote.

(ii) | No Adjustment of Series A Conversion Price. No adjustment in
the Series A Conversion Price shall be made as the result of the issuance or deemed issuance of
Additional Shares of Common Stock if prior to such issuance or deemed issuance, the
Corporation receives written notice from the Required Holders agreeing that no such adjustment
shall be made as the result of the issuance or deemed issuance of such Additional Shares of
Common Stock.

(iii) | Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock.

(A) _ Ifthe Corporation at any time or from time to time after the
Series A Original Issue Date shall issue any Options or Convertible Securities (excluding
Options or Convertible Securities which, upon exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, would
entitle the holder thereof to receive Exempted Securities pursuant to Subsections 4(d)i)(D)(D),
(II), (ID) or (V)) or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of
securities entitled to receive any such Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum
number of shares of Common Stock (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto, assuming the

B3077587.8 10
satisfaction of any conditions to exercisability, convertibility or exchan geability but without
regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable
upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities and Options therefor,
the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to be Additional
Shares of Common Stock issued as of the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shall
have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date.

(B) If the terms of any Option or Convertible Security, the
issuance of which resulted in an adjustment to the Series A Conversion Price pursuant to the
terms of Subsection 4(d)(iv) below, are revised (either automatically pursuant to the provisions
contained therein or as a result of an amendment to such terms) to provide for either (1) any
increase or decrease in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise,
conversion or exchange of any such Option or Convertible Security or (2) any increase or
decrease in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion or
exchange, then, effective upon such increase or decrease becoming effective, the Series A
Conversion Price computed upon the original issue of such Option or Convertible Security (or
upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto) shall be readjusted to such Series A
Conversion Price as would have obtained had such revised terms been in effect upon the original
date of issuance of such Option or Convertible Security. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
readjustment pursuant to this clause (B) shall have the effect of increasing the Series A
Conversion Price to an amount which exceeds the lower of (i) the Series A Conversion Price on
the original adjustment date, or (ii) the Series A Conversion Price that would have resulted from
any issuances of Additional Shares of Common Stock between the original adjustment date and
such readjustment date.

(C) Ifthe terms of any Option or Convertible Security
(excluding Options or Convertible Securities which, upon exercise, conversion or exchange
thereof, would entitle the holder thereof to receive Exempted Securities pursuant to Subsections
4(d)G)(D)(1), (1), (IID or (V)), the issuance of which did not result in an adjustment to the Series
A Conversion Price pursuant to the terms of Subsection 4(d)(iv) below (either because the
consideration per share (determined pursuant to Subsection 4(d)(v) hereof) of the Additional
Shares of Common Stock subject thereto was equal to or greater than the Series A Conversion
Price then in effect, or because such Option or Convertible Security was issued before the Series
A Original Issue Date), are revised after the Series A Original Issue Date (either automatically
pursuant to the provisions contained therein or as a result of an amendment to such terms) to
provide for either (1) any increase or decrease in the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any such Option or Convertible Security
or (2) any increase or decrease in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon such
exercise, conversion or exchange, then such Option or Convertible Security, as so amended, and
the Additional Shares of Common Stock subject thereto (determined in the manner provided in
Subsection 4(d)(iii)(A) above) shall be deemed to have been issued effective upon such increase
or decrease becoming effective.

(D) Upon the expiration or termination of any unexercised
Option or unconverted or unexchanged Convertible Security which resulted (either upon its
original issuance or upon a revision of its terms) in an adjustment to the Series A Conversion
Price pursuant to the terms of Subsection 4(d)(iv) below, the Series A Conversion Price shall be

B3077587.8 I]
readjusted to such Series A Conversion Price as would have obtained had such Option or
Convertible Security never been issued.

(iv) | Adjustment of Series A Conversion Price Upon Issuance of
Additional Shares of Common Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the
Series A Original Issue Date issue Additional Shares of Common Stock (including Additional
Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to Subsection 4(d )(ii1)), without
consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Series A Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such issue, then the Series A Conversion Price shall be reduced,
concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent)
determined in accordance with the following formula:

CP, =CP, * (A+B) +(A+C)
For purposes of the foregoing formula, the following definitions shall apply:

(A) “CP,” shall mean the Series A Conversion Price in effect
immediately after such issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock:

(B) “CP,” shall mean the Series A Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock:

(C) “A” shall mean the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding and deemed outstanding immediately prior to such issue of Additional Shares of
Common Stock (treating for this purpose as all outstanding shares of Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of Options outstanding immediately prior to such issue or upon conversion of
Convertible Securities (including the Series A Preferred Stock) outstanding immediately prior to
such issue);

(D) “B” shall mean the number of shares of Common Stock
that would have been issued if such Additional Shares of Common Stock had been issued at a
price per share equal to CP, (determined by dividing the aggregate consideration received by the
Corporation in respect of such issue by CP;); and

(E)  “C” shall mean the number of such Additional Shares of
Common Stock issued in such transaction.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this
Subsection 4(d), the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional
Shares of Common Stock shall be computed as follows:

(A) Cash and Property: Such consideration shall:

(1) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
aggregate amount of cash received by the
Corporation, excluding amounts paid or payable for
accrued interest;

B3077587.8 12
(Il) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair market value thereof at the
time of such issue, as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors of the Corporation; and

(Ill) in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock
are issued together with other shares or securities or
other assets of the Corporation for consideration
which covers both, be the proportion of such
consideration so received, computed as provided in
clauses (I) and (II) above, as determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

(B) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per
share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been
issued pursuant to Subsection 4(d)(iii), relating to Options and Convertible Securities, shall be
determined by dividing

(1) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by
the Corporation as consideration for the issue of
such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the
minimum aggregate amount of additional
consideration (as set forth in the instruments
relating thereto, without regard to any provision
contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of
such consideration) payable to the Corporation upon
the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the
case of Options for Convertible Securities, the
exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities
and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, by

(II) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock
(as set forth in the instruments relating thereto,
without regard to any provision contained therein
for a subsequent adjustment of such number)
issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities.

(vi) Multiple Closing Dates. In the event the Corporation shall issue on
more than one date Additional Shares of Common Stock that are a part of one transaction or a
series of related transactions and that would result in an adjustment to the Series A Conversion
Price pursuant to the terms of Subsection 4(d)(iv) above, and such issuances occur within a
period of no more than 30 days from the first such issuance to the final such issuance, then, upon
the final such issuance, the Series A Conversion Price shall be readjusted to give effect to all

B3077587.8 13
such issuances as if they occurred on the date of the first such issuance (and without giving effect
to any additional adjustments as a result of any such subsequent issuances within such period).

(e) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If the Corporation shall at
any time or from time to time after the Series A Original Issue Date effect a subdivision of the

outstanding Common Stock without a comparable subdivision of the Series A Preferred Stock or
combine the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock without a comparable combination
of the Common Stock, the Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately before that
subdivision or combination shall be proportionately decreased so that the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be increased in
proportion to such increase in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. If
the Corporation shall at any time or from time to time after the Series A Original Issue Date
combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock without a comparable combination of the
Series A Preferred Stock or effect a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred
Stock without a comparable subdivision of the Common Stock, the Series A Conversion Price in
effect immediately before the combination or subdivision shall be proportionately increased so
that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series
shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in the aggregate number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding. Any adjustment under this subsection shall become effective at the close of
business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective.

(f) Adjustment for Certain Dividends and Distributions. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Series A Original Issue Date shall make or

issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive,
a dividend or other distribution payable on the Common Stock in additional shares of Common
Stock, then and in each such event the Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately before
such event shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance or, in the event such a record date
shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, by multiplying the Series A
Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction:

(1) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of
business on such record date, and

(2) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of
business on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of
such dividend or distribution;

provided, however, that if such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend is not fully
paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the Series A Conversion
Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record date and
thereafter the Series A Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this subsection as of the
time of actual payment of such dividends or distributions; and provided further, however, that no
such adjustment shall be made if the holders of Series A Preferred Stock simultaneously receive
a dividend or other distribution of shares of Common Stock in a number equal to the number of

B3077587.8 14
shares of Common Stock they would have received if all outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event.

(g) Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Series A Original Issue Date shall make or

issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive,
a dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the Corporation (other than a distribution
of shares of Common Stock in respect of outstanding shares of Common Stock) or in other
property and the provisions of Section (C)(1) do not apply to such dividend or distribution, then
and in each such event the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall receive, simultaneously with
the distribution to the holders of Common Stock, a dividend or other distribution of such
securities or other property in an amount equal to the amount of such securities or other property
as they would have received if all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock had been
converted into Common Stock on the date of such event.

(h) Adjustment for Merger or Reorganization, etc. Subject to the provisions
of Subsection 2(c), if there shall occur any reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
consolidation or merger involving the Corporation in which the Common Stock (but not the
Series A Preferred Stock) is converted into or exchanged for securities, cash or other property
(other than a transaction covered by Subsections (e), (f) or (g) of this Section 4), then, following
any such reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger, each share of
Series A Preferred Stock shall thereafter be convertible in lieu of the Common Stock into which
it was convertible prior to such event into the kind and amount of securities, cash or other
property which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation issuable
upon conversion of one share of Series A Preferred Stock immediately prior to such
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger would have been
entitled to receive pursuant to such transaction; and, in such case, appropriate adjustment (as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation) shall be made in the
application of the provisions in this Section 4 with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of
the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, to the end that the provisions set forth in this
Section 4 (including provisions with respect to changes in and other adjustments of the Series A
Conversion Price) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to
any securities or other property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of the Series A
Preferred Stock.

(1) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Series A Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation at its
expense shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable but in any event not later than 10 days
thereafter, compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and
furnish to each holder of Series A Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or
readjustment (including the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property into which the
Series A Preferred Stock is convertible) and showing in detail the facts upon which such
adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the written request at any time of any holder of Series A Preferred Stock (but in
any event not later than 10 days thereafter), furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a
certificate setting forth (i) the Series A Conversion Price then in effect, and (ii) the number of

B3077587.8 15
shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other securities, cash or property which then
would be received upon the conversion of Series A Preferred Stock.

{j) Notice of Record Date. In the event:

(i) the Corporation shall take a record of the holders of its Common
Stock (or other stock or securities at the time issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred
Stock) for the purpose of entitling or enabling them to receive any dividend or other distribution,
or to receive any right to subscribe for or purchase any shares of stock of any class or any other
securities, or to receive any other right;

(ii) of any capital reorganization of the Corporation, any
reclassification of the Common Stock of the Corporation, or any Deemed Liquidation Event; or

(ii) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-
up of the Corporation,

then, and in each such case, the Corporation will give or cause to be given to the holders of the
Series A Preferred Stock a notice specifying, as the case may be, (i) the record date for such
dividend, distribution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or
right, or (ii) the effective date on which such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation,
merger, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is proposed to take place, and the time, if
any is to be fixed, as of which the holders of record of Common Stock (or such other stock or
securities at the time issuable upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock) shall be
entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock (or such other stock or securities) for
securities or other property deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation,
merger, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, and the amount per share and character
of such exchange applicable to the Series A Preferred Stock and the Common Stock. Such
notice shall be given at least 15 business days prior to the record date or effective date for the
event specified in such notice.

5. Mandatory Conversion.

(a) Upon the earlier of (A) the closing of the sale of shares of Common Stock
to the public at a price of at least $6.6080 per share (subject to appropriate adjustment for stock
splits, stock dividends, combinations and other similar recapitalizations affecting such shares), in
a firm-commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, resulting in at least $25,000,000 of proceeds, net
of the underwriting discount and commissions, to the Corporation or (B) a date specified by vote
or written consent of the Required Holders (the date of such closing or such vote or written
consent is referred to herein as the “Mandatory Conversion Date’’), (i) all outstanding shares of
Series A Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock, at the
then effective conversion rate and (ii) such shares may not be reissued by the Corporation as
shares of such series.

(b) All holders of record of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be given
written notice of the Mandatory Conversion Date and the place designated for mandatory
conversion of all such shares of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 5. Such notice

B3077587.8 16
need not be given in advance of the occurrence of the Mandatory Conversion Date. Upon receipt
of such notice, each holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall surrender his, her or its
certificate or certificates for all such shares to the Corporation at the place designated in such
notice, and shall thereafter receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Section 5. On the Mandatory Conversion Date, all
outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have been converted into
shares of Common Stock, which shall be deemed to be outstanding of record, and all rights with
respect to the Series A Preferred Stock so converted, including the rights, if any, to receive
notices and vote (other than as a holder of Common Stock), will terminate, except only the rights
of the holders thereof, upon surrender of their certificate or certificates therefor, to receive
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which such Series A Preferred Stock
has been converted, and payment of any declared but unpaid dividends thereon. If so required by
the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by
written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly
executed by the registered holder or by his, her or its attorney duly authorized in writing. As
soon as practicable after the Mandatory Conversion Date and the surrender of the certificate or
certificates for Series A Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall cause to be issued and delivered
to such holder, or on his, her or its written order, a certificate or certificates for the number of full
shares of Common Stock issuable on such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof
and cash as provided in Subsection 4(b) in respect of any fraction of a share of Common Stock
otherwise issuable upon such conversion.

(c) Subject to Subsection 5(b) above, all certificates evidencing shares of
Series A Preferred Stock which are required to be surrendered for conversion in accordance with
the provisions hereof shall, from and after the Mandatory Conversion Date, be deemed to have
been retired and cancelled and the shares of Series A Preferred Stock represented thereby
converted into Common Stock for all purposes, notwithstanding the failure of the holder or
holders thereof to surrender such certificates on or prior to such date. Such converted Series A
Preferred Stock may not be reissued as shares of such series, and the Corporation may thereafter
take such appropriate action (without the need for stockholder action) as may be necessary to
reduce the authorized number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock accordingly.

6. Redemption.

(a) Redemption. Shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be redeemed by the
Corporation out of funds lawfully available therefor at a price equal to the Series A Original
Issue Price, together with any dividends declared but unpaid thereon (the “Redemption Price”),
in three annual installments commencing 60 days after receipt by the Corporation at any time on
or after July 30, 2011, from the Required Holders of written notice requesting redemption of all
shares of Series A Preferred Stock (the date of each such installment being referred to as a
“Redemption Date”). On each Redemption Date, the Corporation shall redeem, on a pro rata
basis in accordance with the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock owned by each holder,
that number of outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock determined by dividing (i) the
total number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to such
Redemption Date by (ii) the number of remaining Redemption Dates (including the Redemption
Date to which such calculation applies). Ifthe Corporation does not have sufficient funds legally
available to redeem on any Redemption Date all shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be

B3077587.8 17
redeemed on such Redemption Date, the Corporation shall redeem a pro rata portion of each
holder’s redeemable shares out of funds legally available therefor and shall redeem the
remaining shares as soon as practicable after the Corporation has funds legally available therefor.

(b) Redemption Notice. Written notice of the mandatory redemption (the
“Redemption Notice”) shall be given to each holder of record of Series A Preferred Stock not
less than 40 days prior to each Redemption Date. Each Redemption Notice shall state:

(1) the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock
held by the holder that the Corporation shall redeem
on the Redemption Date specified in the
Redemption Notice;

(II) the Redemption Date and the Redemption Price;

(III) the date upon which the holder’s right to convert
such shares terminates (as determined in accordance

with Subsection 4(a)); and

(IV) _ that the holder is to surrender to the Corporation, in
the manner and at the place designated, his, her or
its certificate or certificates representing the shares
of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed.

(c) Surrender of Certificates; Payment. On or before the applicable
Redemption Date, each holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such
Redemption Date, unless such holder has exercised his, her or its right to convert such shares as
provided in Section 4 hereof, shall surrender the certificate or certificates representing such
shares to the Corporation, in the manner and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice,
and thereupon the Redemption Price for such shares shall be payable to the order of the person
whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof. In the event fewer
than all of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock represented by a certificate are redeemed, a
new certificate representing the unredeemed shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall promptly be
issued to such holder.

(d) Rights Subsequent to Redemption. If the Redemption Notice shall have
been duly given, and if on the applicable Redemption Date the Redemption Price payable upon
redemption of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such Redemption Date is
paid or tendered for payment or deposited with an independent payment agent so as to be
available therefor, then notwithstanding that the certificates evidencing any of the shares of
Series A Preferred Stock so called for redemption shall not have been surrendered, dividends
with respect to such shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall cease to accrue after such
Redemption Date and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith after the Redemption
Date terminate, except only the right of the holders to receive the Redemption Price without
interest upon surrender of their certificates therefor.

(e) Redeemed or Otherwise Acquired Shares. Any shares of Preferred Stock
which are redeemed or otherwise acquired by the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries shall be

B3077587.8 18
automatically and immediately canceled and retired and shall not be reissued, sold or transferred.
Neither the Corporation nor any of its subsidiaries may exercise any voting or other rights
granted to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock following redemption.

(f) Failure to Redeem. If the Corporation for any reason fails to redeem any
of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock in accordance with this Section 6 on or prior to the
redemption dates determined in accordance with this Section 6, then the Corporation shall
become obligated to pay, quarterly and in arrears, in addition to the Redemption Price, interest
on the unpaid balance of such price, which shall accrue at a rate equal to the lesser of (i) eight
percent (8%) per annum or (ii) the maximum interest rate allowable under applicable law, until
such price is paid in full. If such failure shall continue for more than 90 days and the Series A
Directors do not constitute a majority of the number of directors constituting the whole Board of
Directors of the Corporation, then, upon receipt of written notice from the Required Holders, the
total number of directors shall be increased to accommodate, and the holders of the Series A
Preferred Stock shall be entitled, voting exclusively and as a separate class, to elect, such number
of additional directors as is necessary to give the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock the right
to elect a majority of the directors constituting the whole Board of Directors of the Corporation.

7. Waiver. Any of the rights, powers, preferences and other terms of the Series A
Preferred Stock set forth herein may be waived by the affirmative consent or vote of the
Required Holders.

8. Notices. Any notice to be given to the Corporation or a holder of its capital stock
hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed effectively given: (a) upon personal delivery
to the party to be notified, (b) when sent by electronic communication in compliance with the
provisions of the General Corporation Law or (c) when mailed, postage prepaid. All
communications to the Corporation shall be sent to the Corporation’s principal place of business,
and all communications to any holder of the Corporation’s capital stock shall be sent to such
holder’s most recent address as appears in the Corporation’s records.

FIFTH: In furtherance of and not in hmitation of powers conferred by statute, it 1s
further provided that:

(a) Subject to the limitations and exceptions, if any, contained in the by-laws of
the Corporation, such by-laws may be adopted, amended or repealed by the board of
directors of the Corporation; and

(b) Elections of directors need not be by written ballot unless, and only to the
extent, otherwise provided in the by-laws of the Corporation; and

(c) Subject to any applicable requirements of law, the books of the Corporation
may be kept outside the State of Delaware at such location or locations as may be
designated by the board of directors of the Corporation or in the by-laws of the
Corporation; and

SIXTH: The Corporation shall indemnify each person who at any time is, or shall

have been, a director or officer of the Corporation and was or is a party or is threatened to be
made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,

B3077587.8 19
criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director
or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director,
officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement incurred in connection with any such action, suit or proceeding, to the maximum
extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as the same exists or
may hereafter be amended. The foregoing right of indemnification shall in no way be exclusive
of any other rights of indemnification to which any such director or officer may be entitled,
under any by-law, agreement, vote of directors or stockholders or otherwise. No amendment to
or repeal of the provisions of this Article SIXTH shall deprive a director or officer of the benefit
hereof with respect to any act or failure to act occurring prior to such amendment or repeal. In
furtherance of and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Corporation shall advance expenses,
including attorneys’ fees, incurred by an officer or director of the Corporation in defending any
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding in advance of the final
disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of
such director or officer to repay such advances if it shall be ultimately determined that he is not
entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation
shall not be required to indemnify or advance expenses to any person in connection with any
action, suit, proceeding, claim or counterclaim initiated by or on behalf of such person.

SEVENTH: Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed between this
Corporation and its creditors or any class of them or between this Corporation and its
stockholders or any class of them, any court of equitable jurisdiction within the State of
Delaware may, on the application in a summary way of this Corporation or of any creditor or
stockholder thereof or on the application of any receiver or receivers appointed for this
Corporation under Section 291 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code or on the application of trustees
in dissolution or of any receiver or receivers appointed for this Corporation under Section 279 of
Title 8 of the Delaware Code order a meeting of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the
stockholders or class of stockholders of this Corporation, as the case may be, to be summoned in
such manner as said court directs. If a majority in number representing three-fourths in value of
the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of this
Corporation, as the case may be, agree to any compromise or arrangement and to any
reorganization of this Corporation as a consequence of such compromise or arrangement, the
said compromise or arrangement and the said reorganization shall, if sanctioned by the court to
which the said application has been made, be binding on all the creditors or class of creditors,
and/or on all the stockholders or class of stockholders, of this Corporation, as the case may be,
and also on this Corporation.

EIGHTH: No director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the
Corporation or to any of its stockholders for monetary damages arising out of such director’s
breach of fiduciary duty as a director of the Corporation, except to the extent that the elimination
or limitation of such liability is not permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended. No amendment to or repeal of the
provisions of this Article EIGHTH shall deprive any director of the Corporation of the benefit
hereof with respect to any act or failure to act of such director occurring prior to such
amendment or repeal.

B3077587.8 20
NINTH: Subject to the voting rights of stockholders set forth herein, the
Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this
Certificate of Incorporation in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and this Certificate of Incorporation, and all rights
conferred upon stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.

TENTH: The Corporation renounces any interest or expectancy of the Corporation
in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any Excluded Opportunity. An “Excluded
Opportunity” is any matter, transaction or interest that is presented to, or acquired, created or
developed by, or which otherwise comes into the possession of, (i) any director of the
Corporation who is not an employee of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, or (11) any
holder of Series A Preferred Stock or any partner, member, director, stockholder, employee or
agent of any such holder, other than someone who is an employee of the Corporation or any of
its subsidiaries (collectively, “Covered Persons”), unless such matter, transaction or interest is
presented to, or acquired, created or developed by, or otherwise comes into the possession of, a
Covered Person expressly and solely in such Covered Person’s capacity as a director of the
