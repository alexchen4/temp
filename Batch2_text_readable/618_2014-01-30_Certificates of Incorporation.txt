set apart in any calendar year of the Corporation, the Board shall declare additional
dividends out of funds or assets legally available therefor in that calendar year, then such
additional dividends shall be declared pro rata on the Common Stock and the Preferred
Stock on a pari passu basis according to the number of shares of Common Stock held by

purpose as holding the greatest whole number of shares of Common Stock then issuable

3. Liquidation Rights. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary (a “Liquidation

Preferred Stock or Common Stock, an amount per share equal to the Original Issue Price
for the Series G Preferred Stock, plus all declared but unpaid dividends on such Series G
Preferred Stock (the “Series G Liquidation Preference’). If upon any liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the Available Funds and Assets shall be

would otherwise be payable in respect of the shares held by them upon such distribution
if all amounts payable on or with respect to such shares were paid in full.

by multiplying (x) $32,000,000 by (y) a quotient, (A) the numerator of which equals the
sum of the Original Issue Price for such particular share of Junior Preferred Stock plus all
declared but unpaid dividends on such particular share of Junior Preferred Stock, and (B)

Funds and Assets shall be insufficient to permit the payment to holders of the Junior
Preferred Stock of their Junior Preferred Liquidation Preference described in this Section
3.5, then the remaining Available Funds and Assets shall be distributed ratably among the
holders of Junior Preferred Stock on an equal priority, pari passu basis, in proportion to
the full preferential amount each such holder is otherwise entitled to receive under this

remaining after the payment or distribution (or the setting aside for payment or
distribution) to the holders of the Preferred Stock of their full preferential amounts
described above in Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 above, then all such remaining
Available Funds and Assets shall be distributed solely among the holders of the then
outstanding Series D Preferred Stock and Common Stock, pro rata according to the
number of shares of Common Stock held by each holder thereof, treating for this purpose
all such securities as if they had been converted to Common Stock pursuant to the terms
of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation immediately prior to such
dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Corporation; provided, however, that the
aggregate amount which the holders of Series D Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
receive under Section 3.4 and this Section 3.6 shall not exceed three (3) times the
Original Issue Price per share for the Series D Preferred Stock.

3.7.‘ Preferred Stock Entitled to Receive Maximum Amounts _in
Liquidation Event. In the event of a Liquidation Event, each holder of Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to receive, for each share of Preferred Stock then held, out of the

6

2093489 v1O/NY
securities or other property to which such holder would be entitled to receive in such
Liquidation Event with respect to such shares if such shares had been converted to
Common Stock immediately prior to such Liquidation Event (in lieu of any payments

3.8 Merger or Sale of Assets. Unless otherwise approved by vote of
the holders of: (A) at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting

D Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, (C) at least a majority of the outstanding
shares of the Series E Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, (D) at least a majority
of the outstanding shares of the Series F Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class and
(E) at least a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series G Preferred Stock, voting as
a separate class, each of the following transactions (each, a “Change of Controf’) shall
be deemed to be a Liquidation Event as those terms are used in this Section 3: (a) any
reorganization, consolidation, merger, sale of shares or similar transaction or series of
related transactions (each, a “combination transaction”) in which the Corporation is a
constituent corporation or is a party if, as a result of such combination transaction, the
voting securities of the Corporation that are outstanding immediately prior to the
consummation of such combination transaction (other than any such securities that are
held by an “Acquiring Stockholder,” as defined below) do not represent, or are not
converted into, securities of the surviving corporation of such combination transaction (or
such surviving corporation’s parent corporation if the surviving corporation is owned by
the parent corporation) that, immediately after the consummation of such combination
transaction, together represent at least a majority of the total voting power of all securities
of such surviving corporation (or its parent corporation, if applicable) that are outstanding
immediately after the consummation of such combination transaction, including
securities of such surviving corporation (or its parent corporation, if applicable) that are
held by the Acquiring Stockholder; or (b) a sale, exclusive license or other conveyance of
all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, and its subsidiaries taken as a
whole, in one transaction or a series of related transactions. For the avoidance of doubt,
the sale of equity securities of the Corporation for the primary purpose of raising
additional working capital shall not be deemed to be a Change of Control. For purposes
of this Section 3.8, an “Acquiring Stockholder” means a stockholder or stockholders of
the Corporation that (i) merges or combines with the Corporation in such combination
transaction or (ii) owns or controls a majority of another corporation that merges or
combines with the Corporation in such combination transaction.

3.9 Non-Cash Consideration. If any assets of the Corporation
distributed to stockholders in connection with any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up
of the Corporation are other than cash, then the value of such assets shall be their fair
market value as determined by the Board in good faith, except that any securities to be
distributed to stockholders in a liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation
shall be valued as follows:

(a) The method of valuation of securities not subject to
investment letter or other similar restrictions on free marketability shall be as follows:

2093489 vIO/NY
(i) unless otherwise specified in a definitive agreement
for the acquisition of the Corporation, if the securities are then traded on the Nasdaq
Stock Market or another national securities exchange or similar national quotation system
(or any of their respective successors), then the value shall be deemed to be the average
of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange or system over the thirty (30) day
period ending three (3) trading days prior to the distribution;

(it) if (i) above does not apply but the securities are
actively traded over-the-counter, then, unless otherwise specified in a definitive
agreement for the acquisition of the Corporation, the value shall be deemed to be the
average of the closing bid prices over the thirty (30) day period ending three (3) trading
days prior to the distribution; and

(iti) if there is no active public market as described in
clauses (i) or (ii) above, then the value shall be the fair market value thereof, as
determined in good faith by the Board (including the consent of at least one of the
Preferred Directors).

(b) The method of valuation of securities subject to investment
letter or other restrictions on free marketability shall be to make an appropriate discount
from the market value determined as above in subparagraphs (a)(i),(ii) or (iii) of this
Section 3.9 to reflect the approximate fair market value thereof, as determined in good
faith by the Board (including the consent of at least one of the Preferred Directors).

4. Redemption. None of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series B
Preferred Stock, the Series C-1 Preferred Stock, the Series D Preferred Stock, the Series
E Preferred Stock, the Series F Preferred Stock, the Series G Preferred Stock or the

of Section 6 below at the record date for the determination of the stockholders entitled to
vote on such matters or, if no such record date is established, the date such vote is taken
or any written consent of stockholders is solicited.

5.3 General. Subject to the other provisions of this Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation, each holder of Preferred Stock shall have full
voting rights and powers equal to the voting rights and powers of the holders of Common
Stock, and shall be entitled to notice of any stockholders’ meeting in accordance with the
bylaws of the Corporation (as in effect at the time in question) and applicable law, and
shall be entitled to vote, together with the holders of Common Stock, with respect to any
question upon which holders of Common Stock have the right to vote, except as may be

shall be elected who either: (i) in the case of any such vote conducted at a meeting of the
holders of such Specified Stock, receive the highest number of affirmative votes (on an

2093489 v10/NY

5.5 Vote by Ballot. Election of directors need not be by written ballot
unless the Bylaws of the Corporation shall so provide.

6. Conversion Rights. The outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be
convertible into Common Stock as follows:

6.1 Optional Conversion.

(a) At the option of the holder thereof, each share of Preferred
Stock shall be convertible, at any time or from time to time prior to the close of business
on the business day before any date fixed for redemption of such share, into fully paid
and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as provided herein.

(b) — Each holder of Preferred Stock who elects to convert the
same into shares of Common Stock shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor,
duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or its transfer agent for the Preferred Stock
or Common Stock, and shall give written notice to the Corporation at such office that
such holder elects to convert the same and shall state therein the number of shares of
Preferred Stock being converted. Thereupon, the Corporation shall promptly issue and
deliver at such office to such holder a certificate or certificates for the number of shares
of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled upon such conversion and shall
promptly pay (i) in cash or, to the extent sufficient funds are not then legally available
therefor, in Common Stock (at the Common Stock’s fair market value determined by the
Board as of the date of such conversion), any declared and unpaid dividends on the shares
of Preferred Stock being converted and (ii) in cash (at the Common Stock’s fair market
value determined by the Board as of the date of conversion) the value of any fractional
share of Common Stock otherwise issuable to any holder of Preferred Stock. Such
conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business

10

2093489 v10/NY
on the date of such surrender of the certificate or certificates representing the shares of
Preferred Stock to be converted (or the date the holder notifies the Corporation or its
transfer agent that such certificate or certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and
executes an agreement reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the
Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates), and the
person entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion
shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such shares of Common Stock on
such date. If a conversion election under this Section 6.1 is made in connection with an
underwritten offering of the Corporation’s securities pursuant to the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the “Securities Act’) (which underwritten offering does not cause an
automatic conversion pursuant to Section 6.2 to take place), the conversion may, at the
option of the holder tendering shares of Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned
upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of the Corporation’s securities pursuant
to such offering, in which event the holders making such elections who are entitled to
receive Common Stock upon conversion of their Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to
have converted such shares of Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of
such sale of the Corporation’s securities in the offering.

6.2 Automatic Conversion.

(a) Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be
converted into fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock (i) immediately
prior to the closing of a firm commitment underwritten public offering, lead managed by
an underwriter of national standing, pursuant to an effective registration statement filed
under the Securities Act covering the offer and sale of Common Stock for the account of
the Corporation in which the offered shares of Common Stock are listed on a nationally
recognized exchange, with aggregate public offering proceeds to the Corporation (before
deduction of underwriters’ discounts and commissions) exceeding Thirty Million Dollars
($30,000,000) (a “Qualified Public Offering’) or (ii) upon the Corporation’s receipt of
the written consent of the holders of (A) not less than a majority of the then outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock (voting together as a separate class, on an as-converted basis),
(B) not less than sixty percent (60%) of the then outstanding shares of Series D Preferred
Stock voting as a separate class, (C) not less than a majority of the then outstanding
shares of Series E Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, (D) not less than a majority
of the then outstanding shares of Series F Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class and
(E) not less than a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series G Preferred Stock,
voting as a separate class, to the conversion of all then outstanding Preferred Stock under
this Section 6.

(b) Upon the occurrence of any event specified in
subparagraph 6.2(a)(i) or (ii) above, the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be
converted into Common Stock automatically without the need for any further action by
the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates representing such shares are
surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent; provided, however, that the
Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common
Stock issuable upon such conversion unless the certificates evidencing such shares of
Preferred Stock are either delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent as provided

1]

2093489 vIO/NY
below, or the holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates
have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement reasonably satisfactory to
the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection
with such certificates. Upon the occurrence of such automatic conversion of the
Preferred Stock, the holders of Preferred Stock shall surrender the certificates
representing such shares at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for the
Preferred Stock or Common Stock (or shall notify the Corporation or its transfer agent
that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and execute an agreement
reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss
incurred by it in connection with such certificates). Thereupon, there shall be issued and
delivered to such holder promptly at such office and in its name as shown on such
surrendered certificate or certificates (or as set forth in the indemnity agreement), a
certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which the
shares of Preferred Stock surrendered were convertible on the date on which such
automatic conversion occurred and any declared and unpaid dividends shall be paid in
accordance with the provisions of Section 6.1(b).

6.3 Conversion Price. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be
convertible in accordance with Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 above into the number of shares
of Common Stock which results from dividing the Original Issue Price by the conversion
price for such series of Preferred Stock that is in effect at the time of conversion (the
“Conversion Price”). As of the Original Issue Date, (a) the Conversion Price for the
Series A Preferred Stock is $0.8209, (b) the Conversion Price for the Series B Preferred
Stock is $2.1502753, (c) the Conversion Price for the Series C-1 Preferred Stock is
$1.8464636, (d) the Conversion Price for the Series D Preferred Stock is $0.6663973, (e)
the Conversion Price for the Series E Preferred Stock is $0.8584483, (f) the Conversion
Price for the Series F Preferred Stock is $0.928 and (g) the Conversion Price for the
Series G Preferred Stock is-$1.4314298. The Conversion Price of each such series of
Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided below.
Following each adjustment of the Conversion Price, such adjusted Conversion Price shall
remain in effect until a further adjustment of such Conversion Price hereunder.

6.4 . Adjustment Upon Common Stock Event. Upon the happening of a
Common Stock Event (as hereinafter defined), the Conversion Price of each such series

of Preferred Stock shall, simultaneously with the happening of such Common Stock
Event, be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock
in effect immediately prior to such Common Stock Event by a fraction, (i) the numerator
of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to such Common Stock Event, and (ii) the denominator of which shall
be the number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately after such
Common Stock Event, and the product so obtained shall thereafter be the Conversion
Price for such series of Preferred Stock. The Conversion Price for a series of Preferred
Stock shall be readjusted in the same manner upon the happening of each subsequent
Common Stock Event. As used herein, the term the “Common Stock Event’ shail mean
at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date, (i) the issue by the
Corporation of additional shares of Common Stock as a dividend or other distribution on
outstanding Common Stock, (ii) a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common

12

2093489 vIO/NY
Stock into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, or (iii) a combination of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock.

6.5 Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. If at any time
or from time to time after the Original Issue Date the Corporation pays a dividend or

makes another distribution to the holders of the Common Stock payable in securities of
the Corporation, other than an event constituting a Common Stock Event, then in each
such event provision shall be made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock shall
simultaneously receive with the holders of Common Stock, the amount of securities of
the Corporation which they would have received had their Preferred Stock been
converted into Common Stock on the date of such event (or such record date, as
applicable).

6.6 Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. If at
any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date the Common Stock issuable

upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock is changed into the same or a different
number of shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by recapitalization,
reclassification or otherwise (other than by a Common Stock Event or a stock dividend,
reorganization, merger, or consolidation provided for elsewhere in this Section 6), then in
any such event each holder of Preferred Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert
such stock into the kind and amount of stock and other securities and property receivable
upon such recapitalization, reclassification or other change that a holder of the same
number of shares of Common Stock into which that number of shares of Preferred Stock
held by such holder could have been converted immediately prior to such
recapitalization, reclassification or otherwise, all subject to further adjustment as
provided herein or with respect to such other securities or property by the terms thereof.

6.7 Reorganizations, Mergers and Consolidations. If at any time or
from time to time after the Original Issue Date there is a reorganization of the

Corporation (other than a recapitalization, subdivision, combination, reclassification or
exchange of shares provided for elsewhere in this Section 6) or a merger or consolidation
of the Corporation with or into another corporation (except an event which is governed
under Section 3.8), then, as a part of such reorganization, merger or consolidation,
provision shall be made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock thereafter shall be
entitled to receive, upon conversion of the Preferred Stock, the number of shares of stock
or other securities or property of the Corporation, or of such successor corporation
resulting from such reorganization, merger or consolidation, to which a holder of that
number of shares of Common Stock into which all the shares of Preferred Stock held by
such holder could have been converted immediately prior to such reorganization, merger
or consolidation would have been entitled to receive upon such reorganization, merger or
consolidation. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application
of the provisions of this Section 6 with respect to the rights of the holders of the Preferred
Stock after the reorganization, merger or consolidation to the end that the provisions of
this Section 6 (including adjustment of the Conversion Price then in effect and number of
shares issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that
event and be as nearly equivalent to the provisions hereof as may be practicable. This
Section 6.7 shall similarly apply to successive reorganizations, mergers and

13

2093489 vIO/NY
consolidations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6, if
any reorganization, merger or consolidation is approved by the vote of stockholders
required by Section 7 hereof, then such transaction and the rights of the holders of
Preferred Stock and Common Stock pursuant to such reorganization, merger or
consolidation will be governed by the documents entered into in connection with such
transaction and not by the provisions of this Section 6.7.

6.8 Sale of Shares Below Conversion Price.

(a) Reserved.

(b) Adjustment Formula for Series A Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock, Series C-1 Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock. If at any time

or from time to time after the Original Issue Date the Corporation issues or sells, or is
deemed by the provisions of this Section 6.8 to have issued or sold, Additional Shares of
Common Stock (as hereinafter defined), otherwise than in connection with a Common
Stock Event as provided in Section 6.4, a dividend or distribution as provided in Section
6.5, a recapitalization, reclassification or other change as provided in Section 6.6, for an
Effective Price (as hereinafter defined) that is less than the Conversion Price for the
_ Series D Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such issue or sale (or deemed
issue or sale), then, and in each such case, the Conversion Price for each series of
Preferred Stock shall be reduced, as of the close of business on the date of such issue or
sale, to the price obtained by multiplying the Conversion Price for each such series of
Preferred Stock by a fraction:

(i) The numerator of which shall be the sum of (A) the
number of Common Stock Equivalents Outstanding (as hereinafter defined) immediately
prior to such issue or sale of Additional Shares of Common Stock plus (B) the quotient
obtained by dividing the Aggregate Consideration Received (as hereinafter defined) by
the Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued or
sold (or deemed so issued and sold) by the Conversion Price for the Series D Preferred
Stock in effect immediately prior to such issue or sale; and

(ii) | The denominator of which shall be the sum of (A)
the number of Common Stock Equivalents Outstanding immediately prior to such issue
or sale plus (B) the number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued or sold (or
deemed so issued and sold).

(c) Adjustment Formula for Series E Preferred Stock, Series F
Preferred Stock and Series G Preferred Stock. If at any time or from time to time after

the Original Issue Date the Corporation issues or sells, or is deemed by the provisions of
this Section 6.8 to have issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock (as
hereinafter defined), otherwise than in connection with a Common Stock Event as
provided in Section 6.4, a dividend or distribution as provided in Section 6.5 or a
recapitalization, reclassification or other change as provided in Section 6.6, for an
Effective Price (as hereinafter defined) that is less than the Conversion Price for the
Series E Preferred Stock, the Conversion Price for the Series F Preferred: Stock or the

14

2093489 v10/NY
Conversion Price for the Series G Preferred Stock, as applicable, in effect immediately
prior to such issue or sale (or deemed issue or sale), then, and in each such case, the
Conversion Price for the Series E Preferred Stock, the Conversion Price for the Series F
Preferred Stock or the Conversion Price for the Series G Preferred Stock, as applicable,
shall be reduced, as of the close of business on the date of such issue or sale, to the price
obtained by multiplying the Conversion Price for the Series E Preferred Stock, the
Conversion Price for the Series F Preferred Stock or the Conversion Price for the Series
G Preferred Stock, as applicable, by a fraction:

(i) The numerator of which shall be the sum of (A) the
number of Common Stock Equivalents Outstanding (as hereinafter defined) immediately
prior to such issue or sale of Additional Shares of Common Stock plus (B) the quotient
obtained by dividing the Aggregate Consideration Received (as hereinafter defined) by
the Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued or
sold (or deemed so issued and sold) by the Conversion Price for the Series E Preferred
Stock, the Conversion Price for the Series F Preferred Stock or the Conversion Price for
the Series G Preferred Stock, as applicable, in effect immediately prior to such issue or
sale; and

(ii) | The denominator of which shall be the sum of (A)
the number of Common Stock Equivalents Outstanding immediately prior to such issue
or sale plus (B) the number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued or sold (or
deemed so issued and sold).

(d) Certain Definitions, For the purpose of making any
adjustment required under this Section 6.8:

(i) The “Additional Shares of Common Stock’ shall
mean all shares of Common Stock issued by the Corporation, or deemed issued as
provided in Section 6.8(e) below, whether or not subsequently reacquired or retired by
the Corporation, other than (such securities, “Exempted Securities”):

Section 6.8, if the Corporation issues or sells any Rights or Options or Convertible
Securities and if the Effective Price of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of such Rights or Options and/or the conversion or exchange of Convertible
Securities (computed without reference to any additional or similar protective or
antidilution clauses) is less than the Conversion Price for the Series D Preferred Stock
then in effect with respect to the Series D Preferred Stock and the Junior Preferred Stock,
the Conversion Price for the Series E Preferred Stock then in effect with respect to the
Series E Preferred Stock, the Conversion Price for the Series F Preferred Stock then in

Convertible Securities upon their issuance and to have received, as the Aggregate
Consideration Received for the issuance of such shares, an amount equal to the total
amount of the consideration, if any, received by the Corporation for the issuance of such
Rights or Options or Convertible Securities, plus, in the case of such Rights or Options,
the minimum amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Corporation upon the
exercise in full of such Rights or Options, plus, in the case of Convertible Securities, the
minimum amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Corporation (other than by
cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities) upon
the conversion or exchange thereof; provided that:

(i) if the minimum amounts of such consideration
cannot be ascertained in such Deemed Issuance, but are a function of antidilution or
similar protective clauses, then the Corporation shall be deemed to have received the
minimum amounts of consideration without reference to such clauses;

(ii) if the minimum amount of consideration payable to
the Corporation upon the exercise of Rights or Options or the conversion or exchange of
Convertible Securities is reduced over time or upon the occurrence or non-occurrence of
specified events other than by reason of antidilution or similar protective adjustments,
then the Effective Price shall be recalculated using the figure to which such minimum
amount of consideration is reduced; and

(iii) if the minimum amount of consideration payable to
the Corporation upon the exercise of such Rights or Options or the conversion or
exchange of Convertible Securities is subsequently increased, then the Effective Price
shall again be recalculated using the increased minimum amount of consideration payable
to the Corporation upon the exercise of such Rights or Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities.

No further adjustment of the Conversion Price, adjusted upon the issuance
of such Rights or Options or Convertible Securities, shall be made as a result of the actual
issuance of shares of Common Stock on the exercise of any such Rights or Options or the
conversion or exchange of any such Convertible Securities. If any such Rights or

19

2093489 v10/NY
Options or the conversion rights represented by any such Convertible Securities shall
expire without having been fully exercised, then the Conversion Price as adjusted upon
the issuance of such Rights or Options or Convertible Securities shall be readjusted to the
Conversion Price which would have been in effect had an adjustment been made on the
basis that the only shares of Common Stock so issued were the shares of Common Stock,
if any, that were actually issued or sold on the exercise of such Rights or Options or
rights of conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, and such shares of
Common Stock, if any, were issued or sold for the consideration actually received by the
Corporation upon such exercise, plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the
Corporation for the granting of all such Rights or Options, whether or not exercised, plus
the consideration received for issuing or selling all such Convertible Securities actually
converted or exchanged, plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the
Corporation (other than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such
Convertible Securities) on the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities,
provided that such readjustment shall not apply to prior conversions of Preferred Stock.

6.9 Certificate of Adjustment. In each case of an adjustment or
readjustment of the Conversion Price for a series of Preferred Stock, the Corporation, at
its expense, shall cause its Chief Financial Officer to compute such adjustment or
readjustment in accordance with the provisions hereof and prepare a certificate showing
such adjustment or readjustment, and promptly following the triggering event date of
such adjustment or readjustment shall mail such certificate, by first class mail, postage
prepaid, to each registered holder of the Preferred Stock at the holder’s address as shown
in the Corporation’s books.

6.10 Payment of Taxes. The Corporation will pay all taxes (other than
taxes based upon income or capital gain) and other governmental charges that may be
imposed with respect to the issue and delivery of shares of Common Stock upon
conversion of shares of Preferred Stock, excluding any tax or other charge imposed in
connection with any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of shares of Common
Stock in a name other than that in which the shares of Preferred Stock so converted were
registered.

6.11 Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be
issued upon any conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional share to which
the holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay the holder cash equal to
the product of such fraction multiplied by the Common Stock’s fair market value as
determined in good faith by the Board as of the date of conversion.

- 6.12 Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation
shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of

Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the
Preferred Stock, such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time
be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and
if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not
be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock,
the Corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be

20

2093489 vIO/NY
necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such
number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.

6.13 Notices of Record Date. In the event that the Corporation shall
propose at any time (i) to declare any dividend or distribution; (ii) to offer for
subscription to the holders of any class or series of its stock any additional shares of stock
or other rights; (iii) to effect any reclassification or recapitalization; or (iv) to effect a
Change of Control, liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation; then, in
connection with each such event, the Corporation shall send to the holders of the
Preferred Stock at least 15 days’ prior written notice of the date on which a record shall
be taken for such dividend, distribution or subscription rights (and specifying the date on
which the holders of stock shall be entitled thereto) or for determining rights to vote in
respect of the matters referred to in clauses (iii) and (iv) above; provided however that the
notice provisions set forth in this Section 6.13 may be shortened or waived prospectively
or retrospectively by the vote or written consent of the holders of at least a majority of the
Preferred Stock, voting as a single class.

6.14 Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to be given to the holders of shares of the
Preferred Stock shall be deemed given upon the earlier of actual receipt or deposit in the
United States mail, by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, postage
prepaid, or delivery by a recognized express courier, fees prepaid, addressed to each
holder of record at the address of such holder appearing on the books of the Corporation.

6.15 No Impairment. The Corporation shall not, without the
appropriate vote of the stockholders under the Delaware General Corporation Law or
Section 7 of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, avoid or seek to
avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed
hereunder by the Corporation, but shall at all times in good faith assist in carrying out all
such action as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate in order to protect the rights,
preferences and privileges of the holders of the Preferred Stock against impairment.

7. Restrictions and Limitations.

subsidiary or otherwise), without the approval, by vote or written consent, of the holders

personally liable for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director.

the liability of a director, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be
eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation
Law, as so amended.

The Corporation shall indemnify to the fullest extent permitted by law any person
made or threatened to be made a party to an action or proceeding whether criminal, civil,

provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with
this Article VII, shall eliminate, reduce or otherwise adversely affect any limitation on

amendment, repeal or adoption of such an inconsistent provision.

manner consistent with the following policy: a corporate opportunity offered to any
person who is a director of the Corporation, and who is also a partner or employee of a

reorganization of the Corporation as a consequence of such compromise or arrangement,
