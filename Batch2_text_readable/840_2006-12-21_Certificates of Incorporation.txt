available therefor, dividends at the rate of 8% of the applicable Original Issue Price (as defined
below) per annum, compounded annually (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations,
splits, recapitalizations and the like with respect to such shares after the filing date hereof), on
each outstanding share of Series C Preferred (the “Accruing Dividends”). The Accruing
Dividends shall accrue on each share of Series C Preferred from the date of original issue thereof
until paid whether or not the Company has earnings, whether or not there are funds legally
available for payment of such dividends, whether or not such dividends are declared by the Board
of Directors of the Company (the “Board’) and whether or not there has been a filing in
bankruptcy affecting the Company, and shall be payable in cash or, at the holder’s election, in
additional shares of Common Stock at the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price (as
defined in Section 4(c) below) only upon the events described in, and subject to the terms of,
Section 3, 4 (excluding any conversion under Section 4(r)) or 5 below. Accruing Dividends for
any period less than a full quarter shall be computed on the basis of the actual number of days
elapsed and a 360 day year consisting of four 90 day quarters.

preference to the holders of Common Stock, shall be entitled to receive, when and as declared by
the Board, but only out of funds that are legally available therefor, cash dividends at the rate of
8% of the applicable Original Issue Price (as defined below) per annum (as adjusted for any stock
dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like with respect to such shares after the
filing date hereof) on each outstanding share of Series B Preferred. Such dividends shall be
payable only when, as and if declared by the Board and shall be non-cumulative.

(c) The “Original Issue Price” of the Series B Preferred shall be $0.40.
The “Original Issue Price” of the Series C Preferred shall be $0.36.

Common Stock until all dividends as set forth in Section 1(a) above on the Serics C Preferred
and Section 1(b) on the Series B Preferred shall have been paid or declared and set apart, except

518824 v3/SD 2.
for: (i) acquisitions of Common Stock by the Company pursuant to agreements which permit the
Company to repurchase such shares at cost upon termination of services to the Company; or
(ii) acquisitions of Common Stock upon exercise of the Company’s right of first refusal to

(e) In the event dividends are paid on any share of Common Stock, the
Company shall pay an additional dividend on all outstanding shares of Series Preferred in a per

aside for each share of Common Stock.

(f) The provisions of Sections 1(d) and 1(e) shall not apply to a dividend
payable in Common Stock, or any repurchase of any outstanding securities of the Company that
is approved by (i) the Board and (ii) the Series Preferred, which approval may be evidenced by
the written approval of the Preferred Directors (as defined in Section 2(e)(ii) below) (which
written approval may be reflected in the minutes of the applicable Board meeting or the
applicable unanimous written consent of the Board).

(g) The holders of the Series Preferred expressly waive their rights, if any,
as described in California Code Sections 502, 503 and 506 as they relate to repurchases of shares
of Common Stock upon termination of employment or service as a consultant or director.

2. VOTING RIGHTS,

(a) General Rights. Each holder of shares of the Series Preferred shall be

(x) | Any amendment or restatement of the Certificate of
Incorporation that would amend, alter or repeal any provision of this Section 2(d).

(e) Election of Board of Directors.

(i) The holders of Series B Preferred, voting as a separate
class, shall be entitled to elect one member of the Board (the “Series B Director”) at each
meeting or pursuant to each consent of the Company’s stockholders for the election of directors,
and to remove from office such director and to fill any vacancy caused by the resignation, death
or removal of such director;

(ii) The holders of Series C Preferred, voting as a separate
class, shall be entitled to elect three members of the Board (the “Series C Directors” and together
with the Series B Director, the “Preferred Directors”) at each meeting or pursuant to each
consent of the Company’s stockholders for the election of directors, and to remove from office
such directors and to fill any vacancy caused by the resignation, death or removal of such
directors;

(iii) | The holders of Common Stock, voting as a separate class,
shall be entitled to elect one member of the Board at each meeting or pursuant to each consent of
the Company’s stockholders for the election of directors, and to remove from office such
directors and to fill any vacancy caused by the resignation, death or removal of such directors;
and

(iv) The holders of Common Stock and the holders of Series
Preferred, voting together as a single class on an as-if-converted basis, shall be entitled to elect
all remaining members of the Board at each meeting or pursuant to each consent of the

518824 v3/SD 5.
Company’s stockholders for the election of directors, and to remove from office such directors
and to fill any vacancy caused by the resignation, death or removal of such directors.

(v) No person entitled to vote at an election for directors may
cumulate votes to which such person is entitled, unless, at the time of such election, the
Company is subject to Section 2115 of the California General Corporation Law (“CGCL’).
During such time or times that the Company is subject to Section 2115(b) of the CGCL, every
stockholder entitled to vote at an election for directors may cumulate such stockholder’s votes
and give one candidate a number of votes equal to the number of directors to be elected
multiplied by the number of votes to which such stockholder’s shares are otherwise entitled, or
distribute the stockholder’s votes on the same principle among as many candidates as such
stockholder desires. No stockholder, however, shall be entitled to so cumulate such
stockholder’s votes unless (i) the names of such candidate or candidates have been placed in
nomination prior to the voting and (ii) the stockholder has given notice at the meeting, prior to
the voting, of such stockholder’s intention to cumulate such stockholder’s votes. If any
stockholder has given proper notice to cumulate votes, all stockholders may cumulate their votes
for any candidates who have been properly placed in nomination. Under cumulative voting, the
candidates receiving the highest number of votes, up to the number of directors to be elected, are
elected.

(vi) During such time or times that the Company is subject to
Section 2115(b) of the CGCL, the Board or any individual director may be removed from office
at any time without cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the
outstanding shares entitled to vote; provided, however, that unless the entire Board is removed,
no individual director may be removed when the votes cast against such director’s removal, or
not consenting in writing to such removal, would be sufficient to elect that director if voted
cumulatively at an election which the same total number of votes were cast (or, if such action is
taken by written consent, all shares entitled to vote were voted) and the entire number of
directors authorized at the time of such director’s most recent election were then being elected.

3. LIQUIDATION RIGHTS,

(a) Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company,
whether voluntary or involuntary (a ‘“‘Liguidation”), before any distribution or payment shall be
made to the holders of any Series B Preferred or Common Stock, the holders of the Series C
Preferred shall be entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Company legally available for
distribution, or the consideration received in such transaction, an amount per share of Series C
Preferred equal to two times the applicable Original Issue Price (as adjusted for any stock
dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like with respect to such shares after the
filing date hereof) plus all unpaid Accruing Dividends for each share of Series C Preferred held
by them. If, upon any such liquidation, dissolution, or winding up, the assets of the Company (or
the consideration received in such transaction) shall be insufficient to make payment in full to all
holders of Series C Preferred of the liquidation preference set forth in this Section 3(a), then such
assets (or consideration) shall be distributed among the holders of Series C Preferred at the time
outstanding, ratably in proportion to the full amounts to which they would otherwise be
respectively entitled under this Section 3(a).

518824 v3/SD 6.
(b) Upon any Liquidation, after the completion of the distribution required
by Section 3(a) and before any distribution or payment shall be made to the holders of any
Common Stock, the holders of Serics B Preferred shall be entitled to be paid out of the assets of
the Company legally available for distribution, or the consideration received in such transaction
an amount of $0.36 per share of Series B Preferred held by them. If, upon any such liquidation,
dissolution, or winding up, after the completion of the distribution required by Section 3(a) the
remaining asscts of the Company (or the consideration received in such transaction) shall be
insufficient to make payment in full to all holders of Series B Preferred of the liquidation
preference set forth in this Section 3(b), then such remaining assets (or consideration) shall be
distributed among the holders of Series B Preferred at the time outstanding, ratably in proportion
to the full amounts to which they would otherwise be respectively entitled under this
Section 3(b).

(c) After the payment of the full liquidation preference of the Series C
Preferred as set forth in Section 3(a) above and the Series B Preferred as set forth in Section 3(b)
above, the assets of the Company legally available for distribution (or the consideration received
in such transaction), if any, shall be distributed ratably to the holders of the Common Stock and
Series Preferred on an as-if-converted to Common Stock basis.

(d) The following events shall be considered a Liquidation under this
Section 3:

{i) any consolidation or merger of the Company with or into
any other corporation or other entity or person, or any other corporate reorganization, in which
the stockholders of the Company immediately prior to such consolidation, merger or
reorganization own less than 50% of the voting power of the surviving entity immediately after
such consolidation, merger or reorganization, or any transaction or series of related transactions
to which the Company is a party in which in excess of 50% of the Company’s voting power is
transferred, excluding (x) any consolidation or merger effected exclusively to change the
domicile of the Company or (y) any transaction or series of transactions solely for bona fide
equity financing purposes in which cash is received by the Company or indebtedness of the
Company is cancelled or converted or a combination thereof (an “Acquisition’’), or

(ii) | asale, lease or other disposition of all or substantially all of
the assets of the Company (an “Asset Transfer”).

(iii) In any of such events, if the consideration received by the
Company is other than cash, its value will be deemed its fair market value as determined in good
faith by the Board. Any securities shall be valued as follows:

(A) Securities not subject to investment letter or other
similar restrictions on free marketability covered by (B) below:

(1) If traded on a securities exchange or through the

Nasdaq Global Market, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the
securities on such quotation system over the 30 day period ending three days prior to the closing;

518824 v3/SD 7.
(2) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value
shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over
the 30 day period ending three days prior to the closing; and

(3) If there is no active public market, the value
shall be the fair market value thereof, as determined by the Board, including at Jeast a majority of
the Series C Directors.

(B) The method of valuation of securities subject to an
investment letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely
by virtue of a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an
appropriate discount from the market value determined as above in (A)(1), (2) or (3) to reflect the
approximate fair market value thereof, as determined by the Board.

4, CONVERSION RIGHTS,

The holders of the Series Preferred shall have the following rights with
respect to the conversion of the Series Preferred into shares of Common Stock (the “Conversion
Rights”):

(a) Optional Conversion. Subject to and in compliance with the
provisions of this Section 4, any shares of Series Preferred may, at the option of the holder, be
converted at any time into fully-paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock. The number
of shares of Common Stock to which a holder of Series Preferred shall be entitled upon
conversion shall be the product obtained by multiplying the applicable Series Preferred
Conversion Rate then in effect (determined as provided in Section 4(b)) by the number of shares
of Series Preferred being converted.

(b) Series Preferred Conversion Rate. The conversion rate in effect at
any time for conversion of any series of Series Preferred (the “Series Preferred Conversion
Rate” for such series) shall be the quotient obtained by dividing the Original Issue Price of such
series of Series Preferred by the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price calculated as
provided in Section 4(c).

(c) Series Preferred Conversion Price. The conversion price for any
series of Series Preferred shall initially be the Original Issue Price of such series of Series
Preferred (the “Series Preferred Conversion Price”). Such initial Series Preferred Conversion
Price shall be adjusted from time to time in accordance with this Section 4. All references to the
Series Preferred Conversion Price herein shall mean the applicable Series Preferred Conversion
Price as so adjusted.

(d) Mechanics of Conversion. Each holder of Series Preferred who
desires to convert the same into shares of Common Stock pursuant to this Section 4, except as
provided in Section 4(r), shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at
the office of the Company or any transfer agent for the Series Preferred, and shall give written
notice to the Company at such office that such holder elects to convert the same. Such notice

518824 y3/SD 8.
shall state the number of shares of Series Preferred being converted. Thereupon, the Company
shall promptly issue and deliver at such office to such holder a certificate or certificates for the
number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled and shall promptly pay
(i) with respect to the Series C Preferred, any unpaid Accruing Dividends in cash, or at the
holder’s election, upon any conversion effected pursuant to Section 4(1) or to the extent sufficient
funds are not legally available therefor, in shares of Common Stock at the applicable Series
Preferred Conversion Price, (ii) with respect to the Series B Preferred, in cash or, to the extent
sufficient funds are not then legally available therefor, in Common Stock (at the Common
Stock’s fair market value determined by the Board as of the date of such conversion), any
declared and unpaid dividends on the shares of Series B Preferred being converted, if any, and
(iii) in cash (at the Common Stock’s fair market value determined by the Board as of the date of
conversion) the value of any fractional share of Common Stock otherwise issuable to any holder
of Series Preferred. Such conversion shal] be deemed to have been made at the close of business
on the date of such surrender of the certificates representing the shares of Series Preferred to be
converted, and the person entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such
conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such shares of Common Stock
on such date.

(e) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If at any time or
from time to time after the date the first share of Series C Preferred is issued (the “Original Issue
Date”) the Company effects a subdivision of the outstanding Common Stock without a
corresponding subdivision of any series of Series Preferred, the applicable Series Preferred
Conversion Price in effect immediately before that subdivision shall be proportionately
decreased. Conversely, if at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date the
Company combines the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares
without a corresponding combination of any series of Series Preferred, the applicable Series
Preferred Conversion Price in effect immediately before the combination shall be proportionately
increased. Any adjustment under this Section 4(e) shall become effective at the close of business
on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective.

(f) Adjustment for Common Stock Dividends and Distributions. If at
any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date the Company pays a dividend or other
distribution in additional shares of Common Stock, each Series Preferred Conversion Price that
is then in effect shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance, as provided below:

(i) Each Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be adjusted by
multiplying each such Series Preferred Conversion Price then in effect by an amount, rounded to
the fifth decimal place, equal to:

(A) _ the total number of shares of Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance, divided by

(B) _ the total number of shares of Common Stock issued

and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance plus the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution;

518824 v3/SD 9.
(ii) If the Company fixes a record date to determine which
holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution, each Series
Preferred Conversion Price shall be fixed as of the close of business on such record date and the
number of shares of Common Stock shall be calculated immediately prior to the close of
business on such record date; and

(iii) If such record date is fixed and such dividend is not fully
paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, each Series Preferred
Conversion Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record date
and thereafter each Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this Section
4(f) to reflect the actual payment of such dividend or distribution.

(g) Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. If at
any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date, the Common Stock issuable upon the
conversion of the Series Preferred is changed into the same or a different number of shares of any
class or classes of stock, whether by recapitalization, reclassification or otherwise (other than an
Acquisition or Asset Transfer as defined in Section 3(e) or a subdivision or combination of
shares or stock dividend or a reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale of assets provided for
elsewhere in this Section 4), in any such event each holder of Series Preferred shall then have the
right to convert such stock into the kind and amount of stock and other securities and property
receivable upon such recapitalization, reclassification or other change by holders of the
maximum number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series Preferred could
have been converted immediately prior to such recapitalization, reclassification or change, all
subject to further adjustment as provided herein or with respect to such other securities or
property by the terms thereof.

(h) Reorganizations, Mergers or Consolidations. If at any time or from
time to time after the Original Issue Date, there is a capital reorganization of the Common Stock
or the merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another corporation or another entity
or person (other than an Acquisition or Asset Transfer as defined in Section 3(e) or a
recapitalization, subdivision, combination, reclassification, exchange or substitution of shares
provided for elsewhere in this Section 4), as a part of such capital reorganization, provision shall
be made so that the holders of the Series Preferred shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon
conversion of the Series Preferred the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of
the Company to which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon
conversion would have been entitled on such capital reorganization, subject to adjustment in
respect of such stock or securities by the terms thereof. In any such case, appropriate adjustment
shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 4 with respect to the rights of
the holders of Series Preferred after the capital reorganization to the end that the provisions of
this Section 4 (including adjustment of each Series Preferred Conversion Price then in effect and
the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Series Preferred) shall be applicable after
that event and be as nearly equivalent as practicable.

518824 v3/SD 10.
(i) Sale of Shares Below Series Preferred Conversion Price.

(i) If at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue
Date, the Company issues or sells, or is deemed by the express provisions of this Section 4(i) to
have issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock (as defined below), other than as
provided in Section 4(e), 4(f), 4(g) or 4(h) above, for an Effective Price (as defined below) less
than the applicable then-effective Series Preferred Conversion Price (a “Qualifying Dilutive
Issuance’), then and in each such case, the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be
reduced, as of the opening of business on the date of such issue or sale, to a price determined by
multiplying the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such
issuance or sale by an amount equal to:

(A)the sum of (1) the number of shares of Common Stock
deemed outstanding (as determined below) immediately prior to such issue or sale, plus (2) the
number of shares of Common Stock which the Aggregate Consideration (as defined below)
received by the Company for the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued
would purchase at such then-existing Series Preferred Conversion Price, divided by

(B) the sum of (i) the number of shares of Common Stock
deemed outstanding (as determined below) immediately prior to such issue or sale, plus (2) the
total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued.

For the purposes of the preceding sentence, the number of shares of Common Stock
deemed to be outstanding as of a given date shal! be the sum of (1) the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding, (2) the number of shares of Common Stock into which the then
outstanding shares of Series Preferred and other outstanding convertible securities could be
converted if fully converted on the day immediately preceding the given date and (3) the number
of shares of Common Stock into which any outstanding warrants, options or other rights for the
purchase of shares of Common Stock, Preferred Stock or other convertible securities could be
converted if fully exercised and fully converted on the day immediately preceding the given date.

(ii) | No adjustment shall be made to the applicable Series
Preferred Conversion Price in an amount less than $0.01 per share. Any adjustment otherwise
required by this Section 4(i) that is not required to be made due to the preceding sentence shall be
included in any subsequent adjustment to such Series Preferred Conversion Price.

(iii) | For the purpose of making any adjustment required under
this Section 4(i), the aggregate consideration received by the Company for any issue or sale of
securities (the “Aggregate Consideration”) shal] be defined as: (A) to the extent it consists of
cash, be computed at the net amount of cash received by the Company after deduction of any
underwriting or similar commissions, compensation or concessions paid or allowed by the
Company in connection with such issue or sale but without deduction of any expenses payable by
the Company, (B) to the extent it consists of property other than cash, be computed at the fair
value of that property as determined in good faith by the Board, and (C) if Additional Shares of
Common Stock, Convertible Securities (as defined below) or rights or options to purchase either
Additional Shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities are issued or sold together with

$18824 vISD 1).
other stock or securities or other assets of the Company for a consideration which covers both, be
computed as the portion of the consideration so received that may be reasonably determined in
good faith by the Board to be allocable to such Additional Shares of Common Stock, Convertible
Securities or rights or options.

(iv) For the purpose of the adjustment required under this
Section 4(i), if the Company issues or sells (x) stock or other securities convertible into,
Additional Shares of Common Stock (such convertible stock or securities being herein referred
to as “Convertible Securities’) or (y) rights or options for the purchase of Additional Shares of
Common Stock or Convertible Securities and if the Effective Price of such Additional Shares of
Common Stock is less than the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price, in each case the
Company shal! be deemed to have issued at the time of the issuance of such rights or options or
Convertible Securities the maximum number of Additional Shares of Common Stock issuable
upon exercise or conversion thereof and to have received as consideration for the issuance of
such shares an amount equal to the total amount of the consideration, if any, received by the
Company for the issuance of such rights or options or Convertible Securities plus:

(A)in the case of such rights or options, the minimum
amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon the exercise of such rights or
options; and

(B) in the case of Convertible Securities, the minimum
amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon the conversion thereof (other
than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities);
provided that if the minimum amounts of such consideration cannot be ascertained, but are a
function of antidilution or similar protective clauses, the Company shall be deemed to have
received the minimum amounts of consideration without reference to such clauses.

(v) If the minimum amount of consideration payable to the
Company upon the exercise or conversion of rights, options or Convertible Securities is reduced
over time or on the occurrence or non-occurrence of specified events other than by reason of
antidilution adjustments, the Effective Price shall be recalculated using the figure to which such
minimum amount of consideration is reduced; provided, that if the minimum amount of
consideration payable to the Company upon the exercise or conversion of such rights, options or
Convertible Securities is subsequently increased, the Effective Price shall be again recalculated
using the increased minimum amount of consideration payable to the Company upon the exercise
or conversion of such rights, options or Convertible Securities.

(vi) No further adjustment of any Series Preferred Conversion
Price, as adjusted upon the issuance of such rights, options or Convertible Securities, shall be
made as a result of the actual issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock or the exercise of
any such rights or options or the conversion of any such Convertible Securities. If any such
rights or options or the conversion privilege represented by any such Convertible Securities shall
expire without having been exercised, the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price as
adjusted upon the issuance of such rights, options or Convertible Securities shall be readjusted to
the Series Preferred Conversion Price which would have been in effect had an adjustment been

518824 v3/SD 12.
made on the basis that the only Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued were the
Additional Shares of Common Stock, if any, actually issued or sold on the exercise of such rights
or options or rights of conversion of such Convertible Securities, and such Additional Shares of
Common Stock, if any, were issued or sold for the consideration actually received by the
Company upon such exercise, plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the Company
for the granting of all such rights or options, whether or not exercised, plus the consideration
received for issuing or selling the Convertible Securities actually converted, plus the
consideration, if any, actually received by the Company (other than by cancellation of liabilities
or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities) on the conversion of such Convertible
Securities, provided that such readjustment shall not apply to prior conversions of Series
Preferred.

(vii) For the purpose of making any adjustment to the
Conversion Price of the Series Preferred required under this Section 4(i), “Additional Shares of
Common Stock” shall mean all shares of Common Stock issued by the Company or deemed to
be issued pursuant to this Section 4(i) (including shares of Common Stock subsequently
reacquired or retired by the Company), other than:

(A)up to an aggregate amount of 33,550,000 shares of
Common Stock (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and

extent that they terminate unexercised or (ii) acquired by the Company from employees,
directors, or consultants pursuant to agreements which permit the Company to repurchase such
shares at cost upon termination of services to the Company), issued or to be issued, whether prior

by the Board (including a the approval of a majority of the Preferred Directors);

(G)any shares of Common Stock issued by the Company

and the gross cash proceeds to the Company (before underwriting discounts, commissions and
fees) are at $50,000,000 (a “Qualified [PO’’),

(H)any Common Stock or Preferred Stock and/or options,
warrants or other Common Stock purchase rights, and the Common Stock issued pursuant to

shares of Common Stock issued by the Company or deemed to be issued pursuant to this
Section 4(i). The “Effective Price” of Additional Shares of Common Stock shall mean the

(viii) In the event that the Company issues or sells, or is deemed
to have issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock in a Qualifying Dilutive Issuance
(the “First Dilutive Issuance’), then in the event that the Company issues or sells, or is deemed
to have issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock in a Qualifying Dilutive Issuance

518824 v3/SD 14.
other than the First Dilutive Issuance (a “Subsequent Dilutive Issuance’) pursuant to the same
instruments as the First Dilutive Issuance, then and in each such case upon a Subsequent Dilutive
Issuance the Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be reduced to the Series Preferred
Conversion Price that would have been in effect had the First Dilutive Issuance and each
Subsequent Dilutive Issuance all occurred on the closing date of the First Dilutive Issuance.

(j) Certificate of Adjustment. In each case of an adjustment or
readjustment of any Series Preferred Conversion Price for the number of shares of Common
Stock or other securities issuable upon conversion of any series of Series Preferred, if such Series
Preferred is then convertible pursuant to this Section 4, the Company, at its expense, shall
compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the provisions hereof and prepare a
certificate showing such adjustment or readjustment, and shall mail such certificate, by first class
mail, postage prepaid, to each registered holder of such series of Series Preferred at the holder’s
address as shown in the Company’s books. The certificate shall set forth such adjustment or
readjustment, showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based,

sold, (ii) the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price at the time in effect, (iii) the number of
Additional Shares of Common Stock and (iv) the type and amount, if any, of other property
which at the time would be received upon conversion of such Series Preferred.

(k) Notices of Record Date. Upon (i) any taking by the Company of a
record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof
who are entitled to receive any dividend or other distribution, or (ii) any Acquisition (as defined
in Section 3(e)) or other capital reorganization of the Company, any reclassification or
recapitalization of the capital stock of the Company, any merger or consolidation of the Company
with or into any other corporation, or any Asset Transfer (as defined in Section 3(e)), or any
voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company, the Company
shall mai] to each holder of Series Preferred at Jeast 30 days prior to the record date specified
therein (or such shorter period approved by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Series
Preferred) a notice specifying (A) the date on which any such record is to be taken for the
purpose of such dividend or distribution and a description of such dividend or distribution,
(B) the date on which any such Acquisition, reorganization, reclassification, transfer,
consolidation, merger, Asset Transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to
become effective, and (C) the date, if any, that is to be fixed as to when the holders of record of
Common Stock (or other securities) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock
(or other securities) for securities or other property deliverable upon such Acquisition,
reorganization, reclassification, transfer, consolidation, merger, Asset Transfer, dissolution,
liquidation or winding up.

(1) Automatic Conversion.

(i) Each share of Series C Preferred shall automatically be
converted into shares of Common Stock, based on the applicable then-effective Series Preferred
Conversion Price, (A) at any time upon the affirmative election of the holders of at least 667%4%
of the outstanding shares of the Series C Preferred or (B) immediately upon the closing of a

518824 v3/SD 1S.
firmly underwritten public offering pursuant to a Qualified IPO. Upon such automatic
conversion, any unpaid Accruing Dividends shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of
Section 4(d).

(ii) | Each share of Series B Preferred shal] automatically be
converted into shares of Common Stock, based on the applicable then-effective Series Preferred
Conversion Price, (A) at any time upon the affirmative election of the holders of at least 50% of
the outstanding shares of the Series B Preferred or (B) immediately upon the closing of a firmly
underwritten public offering pursuant to a Qualified IPO. Upon such automatic conversion, any
declared and unpaid dividends shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of Section 4(d).

(iii) | Upon the occurrence of any of the events specified in
Section 4(1)(i) above with respect to the Series C Preferred and the occurrence of any of the
events specified in Section 4(l){ii) with respect to the Series B Preferred, the applicable
outstanding shares of Series Preferred shall be converted automatically without any further action
by the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates representing such shares are
surrendered to the Company or its transfer agent; provided, however, that the Company shall not
be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such
conversion unless the certificates evidencing such shares of Series Preferred are either delivered
to the Company or its transfer agent as provided below, or the holder notifies the Company or its
transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement
satisfactory to the Company to indemnify the Company from any loss incurred by it in
connection with such certificates. Upon the occurrence of such automatic conversion of the
either the Series C Preferred or the Series B Preferred, the holders of the class of Series Preferred
being converted shall surrender the certificates representing such shares at the office of the
Company or any transfer agent for such Series Preferred. Thereupon, there shall be issued and
delivered to such holder promptly at such office and in its name as shown on such surrendered
certificate or certificates, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock
into which the shares of Series Preferred surrendered were convertible on the date on which such
automatic conversion occurred, and any declared and unpaid dividends shall be paid in
accordance with the provisions of Section 4(d).

(m)Fractional Shares, No fractional shares of Common Stock shal] be
issued upon conversion of Series Preferred. All shares of Common Stock (including fractions
thereof) issuable upon conversion of more than one share of Series Preferred by a holder thereof
shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the conversion would result in the
issuance of any fractional share. If, after the aforementioned aggregation, the conversion would
result in the issuance of any fractional share, the Company shall, in lieu of issuing any fractional
share, pay cash equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by the Common Stock’s fair
market value (as determined by the Board) on the date of conversion.

(n) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Company
shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common
Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Series Preferred,
such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding shares of the Series Preferred. If at any time the number of

518824 v3/SD 16.
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all then outstanding shares of the Series Preferred, the Company will take such corporate
action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.

(0) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Section 4 shall
be in writing and shall be deemed effectively given: (i) upon personal delivery to the party to be
notified, (ii) when sent by confirmed electronic mail or facsimile if sent during normal business
hours of the recipient; if not, then on the next business day, (iii) five days after having been sent
by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or (iv) one day after
deposit with a nationally recognized overnight courier, specifying next day delivery, with
verification of receipt. All notices shall be addressed to each holder of record at the address of
such holder appearing on the books of the Company.

(p) Payment of Taxes. The Company will pay all taxes (other than taxes
based upon income) and other governmental charges that may be imposed with respect to the
issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of shares of Series Preferred,
excluding any tax or other charge imposed in connection with any transfer involved in the issue
and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in which the shares of Series
Preferred so converted were registered.

(q) No Dilution or Impairment. Without the consent of the holders of
then outstanding Series Preferred as may be required under Section 2, the Company shall not
amend its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or participate in any
reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or
take any other voluntary action, for the purpose of avoiding or seeking to avoid the observance or
performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Company, but
shall at all times in good faith assist in carrying out all such action as may be reasonably
necessary or appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holders of the Series
Preferred against dilution or other impairment.

(r) Special Mandatory Conversion.

(i) In the event that any holder of Series C Preferred is not
deemed a Purchaser (as defined in the Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement) under the Note
and Warrant Purchase Agreement, then, effective immediately upon the Effective Date (as
defined in the Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement), all of such holder’s shares of Series C
Preferred shall automatically and without further action on the part of such holder be converted
into the number of shares of Common Stock determined in accordance with the last sentence of
Section 4(a) hereof. Upon conversion pursuant to this Section 4(r)(i), the shares of Series C
Preferred so converted shall be canceled and not subject to reissuance.

(ii) | At any time on or after the date hereof, if a holder of shares
of Series C Preferred is designated as a Breaching Purchaser (as defined in the Note and Warrant
Purchase Agreement) pursuant to Section 2.2 of the Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement,
then, effective immediately upon the Closing Date (as defined in the Note and Warrant Purchase

518824 v3/SD 17.
Agreement) on which the designation of such holder as a Breaching Purchaser occurs, all of such
holder’s shares of Series C Preferred shall automatically and without further action on the part of
such holder be converted into the number of shares of Common Stock determined in accordance
with the last sentence of Section 4(a) hereof. Upon conversion pursuant to this Section 4(r)(ii),
the shares of Series C Preferred so converted shall be canceled and not subject to reissuance.

(iii) Following the date of conversion of shares of Series C
Preferred into Common Stock pursuant to Sections 4(r)(i) or 4(r)(ii), the Company shall provide
written notice to each holder whose shares of Series C Preferred were so converted. Such notice
shall be sent by first class or registered mail, postage prepaid, to each such holder at such
holder’s address last shown on the records of the Company’s transfer agent (or the records of the
Company, if it serves as its own transfer agent). Upon receipt of such notice, each such holder
shall surrender his or its certificate or certificates for all such shares so converted, duly endorsed,
at the office of the Company or any transfer agent of the Company, and shall thereafter receive
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to Section 4(r)(i) or 4(r)(ii), as applicable. As promptly thereafter as is practicable, the Company
shall issue and deliver to such holder, at the place designated by such holder, a certificate or
certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled. The
person in whose name the certificate for such shares of Common Stock is to be issued shall be
deemed to have become a holder of Common Stock on the effective date of the conversion of the
Series C Preferred, unless the transfer books of the Company are closed on that date, in which
case such person shall be deemed to have become a stockholder of record on the next succeeding
date on which the transfer books are open.

5. REDEMPTION.

(a) The Company shall be obligated to redeem the Series C Preferred as
follows:

{i) The holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding
shares of Series C Preferred may require the Company, to the extent it may lawfully do so, to
redeem the Series C Preferred held by such holders that is specified in a written request for
redemption (a “Redemption Request’), delivered to the Company at any time from time to time,
beginning on the fifth anniversary of the Original Issue Date, and ending on the date two years
from such first redemption date, which redemption shall occur within 90 days after the date of
such Redemption Request (each a “Redemption Date”). Within 20 days of receipt of such
Redemption Request, the Company shall send notice of such Redemption Request and inquiry as
to participation in such redemption (a “Redemption Inquiry”) to any holder of Series C Preferred
who was not a party to the Redemption Request. If such holder does not reply to the Redemption
Inquiry within 20 days of receipt of such Redemption Inquiry, such holder will not be included in
such redemption. The Company shall effect such redemptions on the applicable Redemption
Date by paying in cash in exchange for the shares of Series C Preferred to be redeemed on such
Redemption Date a sum equal to the applicable Original Issue Price per share of such Series C
Preferred (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like
after the filing date hereof) plus any unpaid Accruing Dividends with respect to such shares as of

518824 v3/SD 18.
such Redemption Date. The total amount to be paid for the Series C Preferred to be redeemed on
such Redemption Date is hereinafter referred to as the “Redemption Price.”

(ii) At least 30 days but no more than 60 days prior to the
applicable Redemption Date, the Company shall send a notice (a “Redemption Notice’) to all
holders of Series C Preferred to be redeemed setting forth (A) the Redemption Price for the
shares to be redeemed; and (B) the place at which such holders may obtain payment of the
Redemption Price upon surrender of their share certificates. If, on a Redemption Date, the
Company is prohibited under the applicable law from redeeming all shares of Series C Preferred
for which redemption is required hereunder, then it shall redeem such shares on a pro rata basis
among the holders of Series C Preferred in proportion to the full respective Redemption Price to
which they are entitled hereunder to the extent possible and shall redeem the remaining shares to
be redeemed as soon as the Company is not prohibited from redeeming some or all of such shares
under applicable law. The shares of Series C Preferred not redeemed shall remain outstanding
and entitled to all of the rights and preferences provided in this Restated Certificate. In the event
that the Company fails for any reason to redeem shares on a Redemption Date, including without
limitation due to a prohibition of such redemption under applicable law, then during the period
from the applicable Redemption Date through the date on which such shares are redeemed, the
applicable Redemption Price of such shares shall bear interest at the rate of 10% per annum, with
such interest to accrue daily in arrears and to be compounded annually.

(b) On or after each such Redemption Date, each holder of shares of
Series C Preferred to be redeemed shall surrender such holder’s certificates representing such
shares to the Company in the manner and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice, and
thereupon the Redemption Price of such shares shall be payable to the order of the person whose
name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof and each surrendered
certificate shall be canceled. In the event less than all the shares represented by such certificates
are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares. From and
after such Redemption Date, unless there shall have been a default in payment of the Redemption
Price or the Company is unable to pay the Redemption Price due to not having sufficient legally
available funds, all rights of the holder of such shares as holder of Series C Preferred (except the
right to receive the Redemption Price without interest upon surrender of their certificates), shall
cease and terminate with respect to such shares.

(c) In the event of a call for redemption of any shares of Series C
Preferred, the Conversion Rights (as defined in Section 4) for such Series C Preferred shall
terminate as to the shares designated for redemption at the close of business on the fifth day
preceding the applicable Redemption Date, unless default is made in payment of the Redemption
Price.

Vv,

A. The liability of the directors of the Company for monetary damages shall be
eliminated to the fullest extent under applicable law.

518824 v3/SD 19.
B. The Company is authorized to provide indemnification of agents (as defined in

subject, at any time or times that the Company is subject to Section 2115(b) of the CGCL, to the
limits on such excess indemnification set forth in Section 204 of the CGCL.

Cc. Any repeal or modification of this Article V shall only be prospective and shall
not affect the rights under this Article V in effect at the time of the alleged occurrence of any
action or omission to act giving rise to liability.

and in further definition, limitation and regulation of the powers of the Company, of its directors

shall be vested in its Board. The number of directors which shall constitute the whole Board
shall be fixed by the Board in the manner provided in the Bylaws, subject to any restrictions
which may be set forth in this Restated Certificate.

B. Subject to any restriction contained in this Restated Certificate and the
indemnification provisions in the Bylaws of the Company, the Board is expressly empowered to
adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Company. The stockholders shall also have the power
to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Company; provided however, that, in addition to any
vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the Company required by law or by this
Restated Certificate, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power
of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Company entitled to vote generally
in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to adopt, amend or
repeal any provision of the Bylaws of the Company.

Cc. The directors of the Company need not be elected by written ballot unless the
Bylaws so provide.
