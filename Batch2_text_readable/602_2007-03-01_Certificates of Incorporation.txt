Company (the “Board”), but only out of funds that are legally available therefor, non-cumulative
cash dividends, on a pari passu basis, at the rate of (i) eight percent (8%) of the Series A Original

3708386_3 -2-
The right to such dividends on shares of the Preferred Stock shall not be cumulative and no rights

share.

and/or the Series D Original Issue Price.

(f) So long as any shares of Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Company
shall not pay or declare any dividend, whether in cash or property, or make any other distribution on
the Common Stock, or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire for value any shares of Common
Stock until all dividends as set forth in Section 1(a) above on the Preferred Stock shall have been
paid or declared and set apart, except for:

(i) acquisitions of Common Stock by the Company pursuant to
agreements which permit the Company to repurchase such shares at cost (or the lesser of cost or fair
market value) upon termination of services to the Company; or

(ii) | acquisitions of Common Stock in exercise of the Company’s
right of first refusal to repurchase such shares.

(g) In the event dividends are paid on any share of Common Stock, the
Company shall pay an additional dividend on all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock in a per share
amount equal (on an as-if-converted to Common Stock basis) to the amount paid or set aside for
each share of Common Stock.

(h) The provisions of Sections 1(f) and 1(g) shall not apply to a dividend
payable in Common Stock, or any repurchase of any outstanding securities of the Company that is
approved by (i) the Board and (ii) the Preferred Stock, which approval may be evidenced by the
written or oral approval of the persons serving as the representatives of the Preferred Stock.

2. Voting Rights.
(a) General Rights. Each holder of shares of the Preferred Stock shall be

entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of shares of Common Stock into which such

Stock shall vote together with the Common Stock at any annual or special meeting of the
stockholders and not as a separate class, and may act by written consent in the same manner as the

affecting the Preferred Stock after the filing date hereof) remain outstanding, in addition to any other
vote or consent required herein or by law, the vote or written consent of the holders of at least sixty-
six and two-thirds percent (66%%) of the outstanding Preferred Stock shall be necessary for
effecting or validating the following actions:

(i) Any amendment, alteration, or repeal of any provision of the
Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Company (including any filing of a Certificate of
Designation), that alters or changes the voting or other powers, preferences, or other special rights or
privileges, or restrictions of the Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely, including by merger,
consolidation or otherwise; provided, however, that any amendment of the Certificate of
Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Company that alters or changes the powers, preferences or special
rights of a series of Preferred Stock so as to affect that series adversely without so affecting all other

sixty-six and two-thirds percent (6674%) of the outstanding shares of such series voting as a separate
series;

(ii) | Any increase or decrease in the authorized number of shares of
Common Stock or Preferred Stock:

designated number of any such new class or series;

(iv) Any redemption, repurchase, payment of dividends or other
distributions with respect to Common Stock (except for acquisitions of Common Stock by the

Company’s stockholders for the election of directors, and to remove from office such directors and
to fill any vacancy caused by the resignation, death or removal of such directors.

unpaid dividends on the Series D Preferred (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations,

the assets of the Company (or the consideration received in such transaction) shall be insufficient to
make payment in full to all holders of Series D Preferred of the liquidation preference set forth in
this Section 3(a), then such assets (or consideration) shall be distributed among the holders of Series

D Preferred at the time outstanding, ratably in proportion to the full amounts to which they would
otherwise be respectively entitled.

3708386_3 -5-

share of Series C Preferred held by them. If, upon any such liquidation, dissolution, or winding up,
the assets of the Company (or the consideration received in such transaction) shall be insufficient to

the holders of any Common Stock, the assets of the Company legally available for distribution (or
the consideration received in such transaction), if any, shall be distributed ratably to the holders of
the Preferred Stock until such time as (i) the holders of Series A Preferred have received an amount
per share of Series A Preferred equal to the Series A Original Issue Price plus all accrued and unpaid
dividends on the Series A Preferred (as adjusted for any stock, dividends, combinations, splits,
recapitalizations and the like with respect to such shares after the filing date hereof), (ii) the holders
of Series B Preferred have received an amount per share of Series B Preferred equal to the Series B

Sections 3(a) 3(b) and 3(c) above have been made in full, the assets of the Company legally
available for distribution (or the consideration received in such transaction), if any, shall be
distributed ratably to the holders of the Common Stock, Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred and
Series C Preferred on an as-if-converted to Common Stock basis until such time as (i) the holders of
Series A Preferred have received pursuant to Section 3(c) above and this Section 3(d) an aggregate

Issue Price (as adjusted for any stock, dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like
with respect to such shares after the filing date hereof), (ii) the holders of Series B Preferred have

4. Asset Transfer or Acquisition Rights.

(a) In the event that the Company is a party to an Acquisition or Asset
Transfer (as hereinafter defined), then upon the closing of such Acquisition or Asset Transfer each
holder of Preferred Stock shal! be entitled to receive, for each share of Preferred Stock then held, out
of the proceeds of such Acquisition or Asset Transfer, the greater of (i) the amount of cash,
securities or other property to which such holder would be entitled to receive in a liquidation
pursuant to Section 3 hereof or (ii) the amount of cash, securities or other property to which such
holder would be entitled to receive in a liquidation pursuant to Section 3 hereof if such holder had
converted such shares of Preferred Stock into Common Stock immediately prior to the closing of
such Acquisition or Asset Transfer.

(b) For the purposes of this Section 4: (i) “Acquisition” shall mean any
consolidation or merger of the Company with or into any other corporation or other entity or person,
or any other corporate reorganization, in which the stockholders of the Company immediately prior
to such consolidation, merger or reorganization, own less than 50% of the voting power of the
surviving entity immediately after such consolidation, merger or reorganization; or (b) any
transaction or series of related transactions to which the Company is a party in which in excess of
fifty percent (50%) of the Company's voting power is transferred; provided that an Acquisition shall
not include (x) any consolidation or merger effected exclusively to change the domicile of the
Company, or (y) any transaction or series of transactions principally for bona fide equity financing
purposes in which cash is received by the Company or indebtedness of the Company is cancelled or
converted or a combination thereof; and (ii) “Asset Transfer” shall mean a sale, lease or other
disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or the sale or exclusive license of
all or substantially all of the Company’s intellectual property.

(c) In any Acquisition or Asset Transfer, if the consideration to be
received is securities of a corporation or other property other than cash, its value will be deemed its
fair market value as determined in good faith by the Board.

5. Conversion Rights.
The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have the following rights with respect to the

conversion of the Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock (the “Conversion Rights”):

3708386_3 -7-
(a) Optional Conversion. Subject to and in compliance with the
provisions of this Section 5, any shares of Preferred Stock may, at the option of the holder, be
converted at any time into fully-paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock. The number of
shares of Common Stock to which a holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled upon conversion shall
be the product obtained by multiplying the applicable “Preferred Stock Conversion Rate” then in
effect for the applicable series of Preferred Stock (determined as provided in Section 5(b)) by the
number of shares of Preferred Stock being converted.

(b) Preferred Stock Conversion Rate. The applicable conversion rate in
effect at any time for conversion for a series of Preferred Stock (the “Preferred Stock Conversion
Rate”) shall be the quotient obtained by dividing the applicable Original Issue Price in effect for
such series of Preferred Stock by the applicable “Preferred Stock Conversion Price,” calculated as
provided in Section S(c).

(c) Preferred Stock Conversion Price. The conversion price for the
Series A Preferred shall initially be the Series A Original Issue Price (the “Series A Preferred
Conversion Price”). The conversion price for the Series B Preferred shall initially be the Series B
Original Issue Price (the “Series B Preferred Conversion Price”). The conversion price for the
Series C Preferred shall initially be the Series C Original Issue Price (the “Series C Preferred
Conversion Price”). The conversion price for the Series D Preferred shall initially be the Series D
Original Issue Price (the “Series D Preferred Conversion Price” and collectively with the Series A
Preferred Conversion Price, Series B Preferred Conversion Price and Series C Preferred Conversion
Price, the “Preferred Stock Conversion Price”). Each such initial Preferred Stock Conversion Price
shall be adjusted from time to time in accordance with this Section 5. All references to the Preferred
Stock Conversion Price herein shall mean the Preferred Stock Conversion Price as so adjusted.

(d) Mechanics of Conversion. Each holder of Series A Preferred,
Series B Preferred, Series C Preferred or Series D Preferred who desires to convert the same into
shares of Common Stock pursuant to this Section 5 shall surrender the certificate or certificates
therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Company or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock,
and shall give written notice to the Company at such office that such holder elects to convert the
same. Such notice shall state the number of shares of Preferred Stock being converted. Thereupon,
the Company shall promptly issue and deliver at such office to such holder a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled and shall
promptly pay (i) in cash or, to the extent sufficient funds are not then legally available therefor, in
Common Stock (at the Common Stock’s fair market value determined by the Board as of the date of
such conversion), any accrued or declared dividends that are unpaid on the shares of Preferred Stock
being converted and (ii) in cash (at the Common Stock’s fair market value determined by the Board
as of the date of conversion) the value of any fractional share of Common Stock otherwise issuable
to any holder of Preferred Stock. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made at the close of
business on the date of such surrender of the certificates representing the shares of Preferred Stock to
be converted, and the person entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such

conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such shares of Common Stock on
such date.

3708386_3 -8-
(e) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If at any time or
from time to time after the date that the first share of Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred, Series C
Preferred or Series D Preferred, as applicable, is issued (such date being the “Original Issue Date”
with respect to such series of Preferred Stock) the Company effects a subdivision of the outstanding
Common Stock without a corresponding subdivision of the Preferred Stock, the applicable Preferred
Stock Conversion Price in effect immediately before that subdivision shall be proportionately
decreased. Conversely, if at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date the
Company combines the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares
without a corresponding combination of the Preferred Stock, the applicable Preferred Stock
Conversion Price in effect immediately before the combination shall be proportionately increased.
Any adjustment under this Section 5(e) shall become effective at the close of business on the date
the subdivision or combination becomes effective.

(f) Adjustment for Common Stock Dividends and Distributions. If at
any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date the Company pays, without
consideration, a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock in additional shares of
Common Stock, the applicable Preferred Stock Conversion Price that is then in effect shall be
decreased as of the time of such issuance, as provided below:

(i) The applicable Preferred Stock Conversion Price shall be
adjusted by multiplying the applicable Preferred Stock Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction:

(A) _ the numerator of which is the total number of shares of
Common Stock deemed outstanding (as determined below in Section 5(i)(ii)) immediately prior to
the time of such issuance, and

(B) the denominator of which is the total number of shares
of Common Stock deemed outstanding (as determined below in Section 5(i)(ii)) immediately prior to
the time of such issuance plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such
dividend or distribution;

(ii) If the Company fixes a record date to determine which holders
of Common Stock are entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution, the applicable Preferred
Stock Conversion Price shall be fixed as of the close of business on such record date and the number
of shares of Common Stock shall be calculated immediately prior to the close of business on such
record date; and

(iii) If such record date is fixed and such dividend is not fully paid
or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the applicable Preferred Stock
Conversion Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record date
and thereafter the applicable Preferred Stock Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this
Section 5(f) to reflect the actual payment of such dividend or distribution.

(g) Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. If at
any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date, the Common Stock issuable upon the

3708386_3 -9-
conversion of the Preferred Stock is changed into the same or a different number of shares of any
class or classes of stock, whether by recapitalization, reclassification or otherwise (other than an
Acquisition or Asset Transfer as defined in Section 4 or a subdivision or combination of shares or
stock dividend or a reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale of assets provided for elsewhere in
this Section 5), in any such event each holder of Preferred Stock shall then have the right to convert
such stock into the kind and amount of stock and other securities and property receivable upon such
recapitalization, reclassification or other change by holders of the maximum number of shares of
Common Stock into which such shares of Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately
prior to such recapitalization, reclassification or change, all subject to further adjustment as provided
herein or with respect to such other securities or property by the terms thereof.

(h)  Reorganizations, Mergers or Consolidations. If at any time or from
time to time after the Original Issue Date, there is a capital reorganization of the Common Stock or
the merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another corporation or another entity or
person (other than an Acquisition or Asset Transfer as defined in Section 4 or a recapitalization,
subdivision, combination, reclassification, exchange or substitution of shares provided for elsewhere
in this Section 5), as a part of such capital reorganization, provision shall be made so that the holders
of the Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of the Preferred Stock
the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the Company to which a holder of the
number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled on such
capital reorganization, subject to adjustment in respect of such stock or securities by the terms
thereof. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions
of this Section 5 with respect to the rights of the holders of Preferred Stock after the capital
reorganization to the end that the provisions of this Section 5 (including adjustment of the applicable
Preferred Stock Conversion Price then in effect and the number of shares issuable upon conversion
of the Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event and be as nearly equivalent as practicable.

(i) Sale of Shares Below Preferred Stock Conversion Price.

(i) ‘If at any time or from time to time following the applicable
Original Issue Date, the Company issues or sells, or is deemed by the express provisions of this
Section 5(i) to have issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock (as defined below), other
than as provided in Section 5(e), 5(f), 5(g) or 5(h) above, for an Effective Price (as defined below)
less than the then-effective applicable Preferred Stock Conversion Price (a “Qualifying Dilutive
Issuance”), then and in each such case, the then-effective applicable Preferred Stock Conversion
Price shall be reduced, as of the opening of business on the date of such issue or sale, to a price
(calculated to the nearest whole cent) determined by multiplying the applicable Preferred Stock
Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale by a fraction equal to:

(A) the numerator of which shall be (A) the number of
shares of Common Stock deemed outstanding (as determined below) immediately prior to such issue
or sale, plus (B) the number of shares of Common Stock which the Aggregate Consideration (as
defined below) received by the Company for the total number of Additional Shares of Common

3708386_3 -10-
Stock so issued would purchase at such then-effective applicable Preferred Stock Conversion Price,
and

(B) — the denominator of which shall be the number of shares
of Common Stock deemed outstanding (as determined below) immediately prior to such issue or sale
plus the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued.

(ii) | For the purposes of the preceding sentence, the number of
shares of Common Stock deemed to be outstanding as of a given date shall be the sum of (A) the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding, (B) the number of shares of Common Stock into
which the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock could be converted if fully converted on the
day immediately preceding the given date and (C) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable
upon conversion or exercise of any and al] warrants, rights, options or other rights to purchase
Common Stock or Convertible Securities (as defined below) outstanding immediately preceding the
given date.

(iii) | No adjustment shall be made to the applicable Preferred Stock
Conversion Price in an amount less than one cent per share. Any adjustment otherwise required by
this Section 5(i) that is not required to be made due to the preceding sentence shall be included in
any subsequent adjustment to the applicable Preferred Stock Conversion Price.

(iv) For the purpose of making any adjustment required under this
Section 5(i), the aggregate consideration received by the Company for any issue or sale of securities
(the “Aggregate Consideration’’) shall: (A) to the extent it consists of cash, be computed as the net
amount of cash received by the Company after deduction of any underwriting or similar
commissions, compensation or concessions paid or allowed by the Company in connection with such
issue or sale but without deduction of any expenses payable by the Company, (B) to the extent it
consists of property other than cash, be computed as the fair value of that property as determined in
good faith by the Board, and (C) if Additional Shares of Common Stock, Convertible Securities (as
defined below) or rights or options to purchase either Additional Shares of Common Stock or
Convertible Securities are issued or sold together with other stock or securities or other assets of the
Company for a consideration which covers both, be computed as the portion of the consideration so
received that may be reasonably determined in good faith by the Board to be allocable to such
Additional Shares of Common Stock, Convertible Securities or rights or options.

(v) For the purpose of the adjustment required under this
Section 5(i), if the Company issues or sells (x) stock or other securities convertible into Additional
Shares of Common Stock (such convertible stock or securities being herein referred to as
“Convertible Securities”) or (y) rights or options for the purchase of Additional Shares of Common
Stock or Convertible Securities and if the Effective Price of such Additional Shares of Common
Stock is less than the applicable Preferred Stock Conversion Price, in each case the Company shall
be deemed to have issued at the time of the issuance of such rights or options or Convertible
Securities the maximum number of Additional Shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise or
conversion thereof and to have received as consideration for the issuance of such shares an amount

3708386_3 -11-
equal to the total amount of the consideration, if any, received by the Company for the issuance of
such rights or options or Convertible Securities plus:

(A) in the case of such rights or options, the minimum
amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon the exercise of such rights or
options; and

(B) in the case of Convertible Securities, the minimum
amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon the conversion thereof (other than by
cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities); provided that if
the minimum amounts of such consideration cannot be ascertained, but are a function of antidilution
or similar protective clauses, the Company shall be deemed to have received the minimum amounts
of consideration without reference to such clauses.

(C) If the minimum amount of consideration payable to the
Company upon the exercise or conversion of rights, options or Convertible Securities is reduced
over time or on the occurrence or non-occurrence of specified events other than by reason of
antidilution adjustments, the Effective Price shall be recalculated using the figure to which such
minimum amount of consideration is reduced; provided further, that if the minimum amount of
consideration payable to the Company upon the exercise or conversion of such rights, options or
Convertible Securities is subsequently increased, the Effective Price shall be again recalculated
using the increased minimum amount of consideration payable to the Company upon the exercise or
conversion of such rights, options or Convertible Securities.

(D) No further adjustment of the applicable Preferred Stock
Conversion Price, as adjusted upon the issuance of such rights, options or Convertible Securities,
shall be made as a result of the actual issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock or the
exercise of any such rights or options or the conversion of any such Convertible Securities. If any
such rights or options or the conversion privilege represented by any such Convertible Securities
shall expire without having been exercised, the applicable Preferred Stock Conversion Price as
adjusted upon the issuance of such rights, options or Convertible Securities shall be readjusted to the
applicable Preferred Stock Conversion Price which would have been in effect had an adjustment
been made on the basis that the only Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued were the
Additional Shares of Common Stock, if any, actually issued or sold on the exercise of such rights or
options or rights of conversion of such Convertible Securities, and such Additional Shares of
Common Stock, if any, were issued or sold for the consideration actually received by the Company
upon such exercise, plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the Company for the granting
of all such rights or options, whether or not exercised, plus the consideration received for issuing or
selling the Convertible Securities actually converted, plus the consideration, if any, actually received
by the Company (other than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such
Convertible Securities) on the conversion of such Convertible Securities, provided that such
readjustment shall not apply to prior conversions of Preferred Stock.

(vi) For the purpose of making any adjustment to the applicable
Preferred Stock Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock required under this Section 5(i), “Additional

3708386_3 -12-

deemed to be issued pursuant to this Section 5(i) (including shares of Common Stock subsequently
reacquired or retired by the Company), other than:

(A) — shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of the
Preferred Stock;

(B) shares of Common Stock and/or options, warrants or
other Common Stock purchase rights and the Common Stock issued pursuant to such options,
warrants or other rights issued after the applicable Original Issue Date to employees, officers or
directors of, or consultants or advisors to, the Company or any subsidiary, pursuant to stock purchase
or stock option plans or other arrangements that are approved by the Board (including three persons
serving as the representatives of the Preferred Stock);

(C) _ shares of capital stock issued pursuant to the exercise or
conversion of options, warrants or convertible securities outstanding as of the applicable Original
Issue Date;

(D) _ shares of capital stock and/or options, warrants or other
capital stock purchase rights, and the capital stock issued pursuant to such options, warrants or other
rights issued for consideration other than cash pursuant to a merger, consolidation, acquisition,
strategic alliance or similar business combination approved by the Board (including three persons
serving as the representatives of the Preferred Stock);

(E) _ shares of capital stock and/or options, warrants or other
capital stock purchase rights, and the capital stock issued pursuant to such options, warrants or other
rights issued pursuant to any equipment loan or leasing arrangement, real property leasing
arrangement or debt financing from a bank or similar financial institution approved by the Board
(including three persons serving as the representatives of the Preferred Stock);

(F) any equity securities issued in connection with strategic
transactions involving the Company and other entities, including (i) joint ventures, manufacturing,
marketing or distribution arrangements or (ii) technology transfer or development arrangements;
provided that the issuance of shares therein has been approved by the Company’s Board (including
three persons serving as the representatives designated by the Preferred Stock);

(G) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable as a
dividend or distribution on the Preferred Stock; and

(H) _ shares of Common Stock issued upon a Qualified IPO
(as defined below).

References to Common Stock in the subsections of this clause (vi) above shall mean all

shares of Common Stock issued by the Company or deemed to be issued pursuant to this
Section 5(i). The “Effective Price” of Additional Shares of Common Stock shall mean the quotient

3708386_3 -13-
determined by dividing the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock issued or sold, or
deemed to have been issued or sold by the Company under this Section 5(i), into the Aggregate
Consideration received, or deemed to have been received by the Company for such issue under this
Section 5(i), for such Additional Shares of Common Stock.

(vii) In the event that the Company issues or sells, or is deemed to
have issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock in a Qualifying Dilutive Issuance (the
“First Dilutive Issuance”), then in the event that the Company issues or sells, or is deemed to have
issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock in a Qualifying Dilutive Issuance other than the
First Dilutive Issuance (a “Subsequent Dilutive Issuance”) pursuant to the same instruments as the
First Dilutive Issuance, then and in each such case upon a Subsequent Dilutive Issuance the
applicable Preferred Stock Conversion Price shal! be reduced to the applicable Preferred Stock
Conversion Price that would have been in effect had the First Dilutive Issuance and each Subsequent
Dilutive Issuance all occurred on the closing date of the First Dilutive Issuance.

(j) Certificate of Adjustment. In each case of an adjustment or
readjustment of the applicable Preferred Stock Conversion Price for the number of shares of
Common Stock or other securities issuable upon conversion of the applicable Preferred Stock, if the
applicable Preferred Stock is then convertible pursuant to this Section 5, the Company, at its
expense, shall compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the provisions hereof
and prepare a certificate showing such adjustment or readjustment, and shall mail such certificate, by
first class mail, postage prepaid, to each registered holder of applicable Preferred Stock at the

any Additional Shares of Common Stock issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold,
(ii) the applicable Preferred Stock Conversion Price at the time in effect, (iii) the number of
Additional Shares of Common Stock and (iv) the type and amount, if any, of other property which at
the time would be received upon conversion of the applicable Preferred Stock.

(k) Notices of Record Date. Upon (i) any taking by the Company of a
record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof
who are entitled to receive any dividend or other distribution, or (ii) any Acquisition (as defined in
Section 4) or other capital reorganization of the Company, any reclassification or recapitalization of
the capital stock of the Company, any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into any
other corporation, or any Asset Transfer (as defined in Section 4), or any voluntary or involuntary
dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company, the Company shall mail to each holder of
Preferred Stock at least ten (10) days prior to the record date specified therein (or such shorter period
approved by the holders of sixty-six and two-thirds percent (667”4%) of the outstanding Preferred
Stock) a notice specifying (A) the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of
such dividend or distribution and a description of such dividend or distribution, (B) the date on
which any such Acquisition, reorganization, reclassification, transfer, consolidation, merger, Asset
Transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to become effective, and (C) the date, if
any, that is to be fixed as to when the holders of record of Common Stock (or other securities) shall

3708386_3 -14-
be entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock (or other securities) for securities or other
property deliverable upon such Acquisition, reorganization, reclassification, transfer, consolidation,
merger, Asset Transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up.

)) Automatic Conversion.

(i) | Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted
into shares of Common Stock, based on the then-effective applicable Preferred Stock Conversion
Price, (A) at any time upon the affirmative election of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds
percent (66%4%) of the then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, or (B) immediately upon the
closing of a firmly underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, covering the offer and sale of Common Stock for the
account of the Company in which (i) the per share offering price is not less than $3.08967 adjusted
for stock splits, dividends, recapitalizations and the like after the filing date hereof), and (ii) the
gross cash proceeds to the Company (before underwriting discounts, commissions and fees) are at
least $25,000,000 (a “Qualified IPO”).

(ii) | Upon the occurrence of either of the events specified in
Section 5(1)(i) above, the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically
without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates
representing such shares are surrendered to the Company or its transfer agent; provided, however,
that the Company shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion unless the certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are
either delivered to the Company or its transfer agent as provided below, or the holder notifies the
Company or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes
an agreement satisfactory to the Company to indemnify the Company from any loss incurred by it in
connection with such certificates. Upon the occurrence of such automatic conversion of the
Preferred Stock, the holders of Preferred Stock shall surrender the certificates representing such
shares at the office of the Company or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock. Thereupon, there
shall be issued and delivered to such holder promptly at such office and in its name as shown on
such surrendered certificate or certificates, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of
Common Stock into which the shares of Preferred Stock surrendered were convertible on the date on
which such automatic conversion occurred, and any accrued or declared dividends that are unpaid
shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of Section 5(d).

(m) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be
issued upon conversion of Preferred Stock. Al! shares of Common Stock (including fractions
thereof) issuable upon conversion of more than one share of Preferred Stock by a holder thereof shall
be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the conversion would result in the issuance of
any fractional share. If, after the aforementioned aggregation, the conversion would result in the
issuance of any fractional share, the Company shall, in lieu of issuing any fractional share, pay cash
equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by the Common Stock’s fair market value (as
determined by the Board) on the date of conversion.

37083863 -15-
(n) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Company
shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common
Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock, such
number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock. If at any time the number of authorized
but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then
outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, the Company will take such corporate action as may, in
the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common
Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.

(0) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Section 5 shall
be in writing and shall be deemed effectively given: (i) upon personal delivery to the party to be
notified, (ii) when sent by confirmed electronic mail or facsimile if sent during normal business
hours of the recipient; if not, then on the next business day, (iii) five (5) days after having been sent
by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or (iv) one (1) day after
deposit with a nationally recognized overnight courier, specifying next day delivery, with
verification of receipt. All notices shall be addressed to each holder of record at the address of such
holder appearing on the books of the Company.

(p) Payment of Taxes. The Company will pay all taxes (other than taxes
based upon income) and other governmental charges that may be imposed with respect to the issue
or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of shares of Preferred Stock, excluding any
tax or other charge imposed in connection with any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of
shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in which the shares of Preferred Stock so
converted were registered.

(q) No Dilution or Impairment. Without the consent of the holders of
then outstanding Preferred Stock as may be required under Section 2(b), the Company shall not
amend its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or participate in any reorganization,
transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or take any other
voluntary action, for the purpose of avoiding or seeking to avoid the observance or performance of
any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Company, but shall at all times in
good faith assist in carrying out all such action as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate in
order to protect the conversion rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock against dilution or other
impairment.

6. Redemption.

(a) | The Company shall be obligated to redeem the Preferred Stock as

follows:

(i) The holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (664%)
of the then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred, Series C Preferred and
Series D Preferred, voting together as a single class, may require the Company, to the extent it may
lawfully do so, to redeem the Preferred Stock in three (3) annual installments beginning not prior to

3708386_3 -16-
the fifth anniversary of the Original Issue Date of the Series D Preferred, and ending on the date two
(2) years from such first redemption date (each a “Redemption Date”). The Company shall effect
such redemptions on the applicable Redemption Date by paying in cash in exchange for the shares of
Preferred Stock to be redeemed a sum equal to the applicable Original Issue Price per share of each
series of Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations
and the like after the filing date hereof) plus accrued or declared dividends that are unpaid with
respect to such shares. The total amount to be paid for the Preferred Stock is hereinafter referred to
as the “Redemption Price.” The number of shares of Preferred Stock that the Company shall be
required to redeem on any one Redemption Date shall be equal to the amount determined by
dividing (A) the aggregate number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Redemption Date by (B) the number of remaining Redemption Dates (including the Redemption
Date to which such calculation applies). Shares subject to redemption pursuant to this
Section 6(a) shall be redeemed from each holder of Preferred Stock on a pro rata basis, based on the
number of shares then held.

(ii) At least thirty (30) days but no more than sixty (60) days prior
to the first Redemption Date, the Company shall send a notice (a “Redemption Notice”) to all
holders of Preferred Stock to be redeemed setting forth (A) the Redemption Price for the shares to be
redeemed; and (B) the place at which such holders may obtain payment of the Redemption Price
upon surrender of their share certificates. If the Company does not have sufficient funds legally
available to redeem all shares to be redeemed at the Redemption Date (including, if applicable, those
to be redeemed at the option of the Company), then it shall so notify such holders and shall redeem
such shares pro rata (based on the portion of the aggregate Redemption Price payable to them) to the
extent possible and shall redeem the remaining shares to be redeemed as soon as sufficient funds are
legally available.

(b) On or prior to the Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit the
Redemption Price of all shares to be redeemed with a bank or trust company having aggregate
capital and surplus in excess of $100,000,000, as a trust fund, with irrevocable instructions and
authority to the bank or trust company to pay, on and after such Redemption Date, the Redemption
Price of the shares to their respective holders upon the surrender of their share certificates. Any
moneys deposited by the Company pursuant to this Section 6(b) for the redemption of shares
thereafter converted into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 5 hereof no later than the fifth
(Sth) day preceding the applicable Redemption Date shall be returned to the Company forthwith
upon such conversion. The balance of any funds deposited by the Company pursuant to this
Section 6(b) remaining unclaimed at the expiration of one (1) year following such Redemption Date
shall be returned to the Company promptly upon its written request.

(c) On or after each such Redemption Date, each holder of shares of
Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall surrender such holder’s certificates representing such shares to
the Company in the manner and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice, and thereupon the
Redemption Price of such shares shall be payable to the order of the person whose name appears on
such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof and each surrendered certificate shall be
canceled. In the event Jess than all the shares represented by such certificates are redeemed, a new

3708386_3 -17-
certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares. From and after such Redemption
Date, unless there shall have been a default in payment of the Redemption Price or the Company is
unable to pay the Redemption Price due to not having sufficient legally available funds, all rights of
the holder of such shares as holder of Preferred Stock (except the right to receive the Redemption
Price without interest upon surrender of their certificates), shall cease and terminate with respect to
such shares; provided that in the event that shares of Preferred Stock are not redeemed due to a
default in payment by the Company or because the Company does not have sufficient legally
available funds, such shares of Preferred Stock shall remain outstanding and shall be entitled to all of
the rights and preferences provided herein until redeemed.

(d) In the event of a call for redemption of any shares of Preferred Stock,
the Conversion Rights (as defined in Section 5) for such Preferred Stock shall terminate as to the
shares designated for redemption at the close of business on the applicable Redemption Date, unless
default is made in payment of the Redemption Price.

7. No Reissuance of Preferred Stock.

No shares of Preferred Stock acquired by the Company by reason of redemption, purchase,
conversion or otherwise shall be reissued.

V.

A. The liability of the directors of the Company for monetary damages shall be
eliminated to the fullest extent under applicable law.

B. Any repeal or modification of this Article V shall only be prospective and shall not
affect the rights under this Article V in effect at the time of the alleged occurrence of any action or
omission to act giving rise to liability.

VI.

For the management of the business and for the conduct of the affairs of the Company, and in
further definition, limitation and regulation of the powers of the Company, of its directors and of its
stockholders or any class thereof, as the case may be, it is further provided that:

A. The management of the business and the conduct of the affairs of the Company shall
be vested in its Board. The number of directors which shall constitute the whole Board shall be
fixed by the Board in the manner provided in the Bylaws, subject to any restrictions which may be
set forth in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

B. The Board of Directors is expressly empowered to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws
of the Company. The stockholders shall also have the power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws
of the Company; provided, however, that, in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or
series of stock of the Company required by law or by this Certificate of Incorporation, the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all of the then

3708386_3 -18-
outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to adopt, amend or repeal any provision
of the Bylaws of the Company.

C. The directors of the Company need not be elected by written ballot.
