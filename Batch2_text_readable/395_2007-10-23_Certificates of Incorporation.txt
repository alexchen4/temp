A. COMMON STOCK.

1. General. The voting, dividend and liquidation rights of the holders of the

any series as may be designated by the Board of Directors upon any issuance of the Preferred
Stock of any series.

2. Voting. The holders of the Common Stock are entitled to one vote for each share
held at all meetings of stockholders (and written actions in lieu of meetings). There shall be no
cumulative voting.

The number of authorized shares of Common Stock may be increased or decreased (but

of a majority of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote, irrespective of the provisions of
Section 242(b)(2) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.

series to have such terms as stated or expressed herein and in the resolution or resolutions
providing for the issue of such series adopted by the Board of Directors of the Corporation as
hereinafter provided. Any shares of Preferred Stock which may be redeemed, purchased or
acquired by the Corporation may be reissued except as otherwise provided by law. Different
series of Preferred Stock shall not be construed to constitute different classes of shares for the
purposes of voting by classes unless expressly provided.

Authority is hereby expressly granted to the Board of Directors from time to time to issue
the Preferred Stock in one or more series, and in connection with the creation of any such series,
by resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of the shares thereof, to determine and fix

relative participating, optional or other special rights, and qualifications, limitations or
restrictions thereof, including without limitation thereof, dividend rights, conversion rights,
redemption privileges and liquidation preferences, as shall be stated and expressed in such
resolutions, all to the full extent now or hereafter permitted by the General Corporation Law of

issuance of any series of Preferred Stock may provide that such series shall be superior or rank
equally or be junior to the Preferred Stock of any other series to the extent permitted by law.
Except as otherwise provided in this Certificate of Incorporation, no vote of the holders of the

2
Preferred Stock or Common Stock shall be a prerequisite to the designation or issuance of any
shares of any series of the Preferred Stock authorized by and complying with the conditions of
this Certificate of Incorporation, the right to have such vote being expressly waived by all
present and future holders of the capital stock of the Corporation.

C. SERIES A, B AND C CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK.

one (4,254,571) shares of Preferred Stock of the Corporation are “Series B Convertible Preferred

1. Dividends. The Corporation shall not declare, pay or set aside any dividends
(other than dividends payable in shares of Common Stock) on shares of Common Stock unless
the holders of the Preferred Stock then outstanding shall first receive, or simultaneously receive,
a dividend on each outstanding share of Preferred Stock equal to the product of (i) the per share
dividend to be declared, paid or set aside for the Common Stock, multiplied by (ii) the number of
shares of Common Stock into which such share of Preferred Stock is then convertible.

2. Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up; Certain Mergers, Consolidations and
Asset Sales.

(a) Priority Payments to Holders of Preferred Stock. In the event of any voluntary or
involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the holders of shares of
Preferred Stock then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Corporation
available for distribution to its stockholders, before any payment shall be made to the holders of
Common Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, (i) in the case of the Series A Preferred
Stock, an amount equal to the greater of (A) $0.60 per share of Series A Preferred Stock (subject
to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other
similar recapitalization affecting such shares), plus any declared but unpaid dividends on such
shares, or (B) such amount per share of Series A Preferred Stock as would have been payable
had such share been converted into Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of Section 4
immediately prior to such liquidation, dissolution or winding up (the “Series A Liquidation
Amount”), (ii) in the case of the Series B Preferred Stock, an amount equal to the greater of (A)
$1.008 per share of Series B Preferred Stock (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of
any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization affecting such
shares), plus any declared but unpaid dividends on such shares, or (B) such amount per share of
Series B Preferred Stock as would have been payable had such share been converted into

dissolution or winding up (the “Series B Liquidation Amount”), and (iii) in the case of the Series
C Preferred Stock, an amount equal to the greater of (A) $1.49 per share of Series C Preferred
Stock (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split,

3
combination or other similar recapitalization affecting such shares), plus any declared but unpaid
dividends on such shares, or (B) such amount per share of Series C Preferred Stock as would
have been payable had such share been converted into Common Stock pursuant to the provisions
of Section 4 immediately prior to such liquidation, dissolution or winding up (the “Series C
Liquidation Amount”). If upon any such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation the remaining assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders
shall be insufficient to pay the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock the full Series A
Liquidation Amount, the holders of Series B Preferred Stock the full Series B Liquidation
Amount and the holders of Series C Preferred Stock the full Series C Liquidation Amount, the
holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred
Stock shall share ratably in any distribution of the remaining assets and funds of the Corporation
in proportion to the respective amounts which would otherwise be payable in respect of the
shares held by them upon such distribution if all amounts payable on or with respect to such
shares were paid in full.

(b) Payments to Holders of Common Stock. After the payment of all preferential
amounts required to be paid to the holders of Preferred Stock, upon the dissolution, liquidation or
winding up of the Corporation, the remaining assets and funds of the Corporation available for
distribution to its stockholders shall be distributed among the holders of shares of Common
Stock pro rata based on the number of shares of Common Stock held by each.

(c) Deemed Liquidation Events.

(i) The following events shall be deemed to be a liquidation of the
Corporation for purposes of this Section 2 (a “Deemed Liquidation Event”):

(A) | amerger or consolidation in which
(1) the Corporation is a constituent party, or

(II)  asubsidiary of the Corporation is a constituent party and
the Corporation issues shares of its capital stock pursuant to such merger
or consolidation,

except any such merger or consolidation involving the Corporation or a subsidiary in which the
holders of capital stock of the Corporation immediately prior to such merger or consolidation
continue to hold immediately following such merger or consolidation at least a majority by
voting power of the capital stock of (1) the surviving or resulting corporation or (2) if the
surviving or resulting corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary of another corporation
immediately following such merger or consolidation, the parent corporation of such surviving or
resulting corporation; or

(B) _ the sale or exclusive license, in a single transaction or series of
related transactions, by the Corporation of all or substantially all the assets of the
Corporation (except where such sale is to a wholly owned subsidiary of the
Corporation).
(ii) | The Corporation shall not effect any transaction constituting a Deemed
Liquidation Event pursuant to Section 2(c)(i)(A) above unless (A) the agreement or plan
of merger or consolidation provides that the consideration payable to the stockholders of
the Corporation shall be allocated among the holders of capital stock of the Corporation
in accordance with Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above or (B) the holders of at least a majority
of the then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, the holders of at least 60% of
the then outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock and the holders of at least two
thirds of the then outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock, each voting separately
as a class, specifically consent in writing to the allocation of such consideration in a
manner different from that provided in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above.

(iii) In the event of a Deemed Liquidation Event pursuant to Section 2(c)(i)(B)
above, the Corporation shall effect a dissolution of the Corporation under the Delaware
General Corporation Law within 90 days after such Deemed Liquidation Event. The
Corporation shall use the consideration received by the Corporation for such Deemed
Liquidation Event (net of any liabilities associated with the assets sold or exclusively
licensed, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation), to the
extent legally available therefor (the “Net Proceeds”), to redeem, on the 90" day after
such Deemed Liquidation Event (the “Liquidation Redemption Date”), all outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock at a price per share equal to the Series A Liquidation Amount,
Series B Liquidation Amount or Series C Liquidation Amount, as the case may be. In the
event of a redemption pursuant to the preceding sentence, if the Net Proceeds are not
sufficient to redeem all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall
redeem a pro rata portion of each holder’s shares of Preferred Stock in proportion to the
respective amounts which would otherwise be payable in respect of the shares of
Preferred Stock held by them upon such redemption if all such shares were redeemed in
full. The provisions of Sections 6(b) through 6(e) below shall apply, with such necessary
changes in the details thereof as are necessitated by the context, to the redemption of the
Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 2(c)(iii). Prior to the distribution or redemption
provided for in this Section 2(c)(iii), the Corporation shall not expend or dissipate the
consideration received for such Deemed Liquidation Event, except to discharge expenses
incurred in the ordinary course of business.

(iv) |The amount deemed paid or distributed to the holders of capital stock of
the Corporation upon any such merger, consolidation, sale or redemption shall be the
cash or the value of the property, rights or securities paid or distributed to such holders by
the Corporation or the acquiring person, firm or other entity. The value of such property,
rights or securities shal! be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the

Corporation.
3. Voting.

(a) | On any matter presented to the stockholders of the Corporation for their action or
consideration at any meeting of stockholders of the Corporation (or by written action of
stockholders in lieu of meeting), each holder of outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of whole shares of Common Stock into

5
which the shares of Preferred Stock held by such holder are convertible as of the record date for
determining stockholders entitled to vote on such matter. Except as provided by law or by the
provisions of Sections 3(b) and 3(c) below, holders of Preferred Stock shall vote together with
the holders of Common Stock, and with the holders of any other series of Preferred Stock the
terms of which so provide, as a single class.

(b) | The Corporation shall not amend, alter or repeal the preferences, rights or
privileges or any terms of any series of Preferred Stock so as to affect adversely such series of
Preferred Stock (the “Affected Series”) without the written consent or affirmative vote of the
holders of the Requisite Vote (as defined below) of the then outstanding shares of the Affected
Series, given in writing or by vote at a meeting, consenting or voting (as the case may be)
separately as a class; provided, however, that, subject to the provisions of Section 242 of the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, only the consent of the holders of a majority
of all then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class (on an as-
converted basis), shall be required if such amendment affects all Preferred Stock in the same
manner. “Requisite Vote” shall mean (i) in the case of the Series A Preferred Stock, a majority
of the votes entitled to be cast by such shares, (ii) in the case of the Series B Preferred Stock,
60% of the votes entitled to be cast by such shares, and (iii) in the case of the Series C Preferred
Stock, two thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by such shares. The creation or issuance of any
class or series of stock senior to, or on a parity with, the Series A Preferred Stock shall be
deemed not to adversely affect the Series A Preferred Stock and shall not require the written
consent or affirmative vote of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock.

(c) Without the written consent or affirmative vote of the holders of 60% of the then
outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock, given in writing or
by vote at a meeting, consenting or voting (as the case may be) together as a separate class, the
Corporation shall not:

(i) create any class or series of stock senior to the Series B Preferred Stock or
the Series C Preferred Stock, or any class or series of stock on a parity
with the Series B Preferred Stock or the Series C Preferred Stock, whether
pursuant to the provisions of Section 151(g) of the General Corporation
Law of Delaware or otherwise;

(ii) effect a change of control, liquidation, merger, reincorporation, or
recapitalization involving the Corporation, or a sale, exclusive license or
other transfer of all or substantially all of the Corporation’s assets;

(iii) | change the number of directors; or

(iv) declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution on any shares of the
Corporation’s capital stock (other than dividends on Common Stock
payable solely in Common Stock) or apply any of the Corporation’s assets
to the redemption or repurchase of the Corporation’s capital stock (except
as contemplated by this Certificate of Incorporation or the Amended and
Restated Right of First Refusal and Co-Sale Agreement dated on or about

6
the date of filing this Restated Certificate of Incorporation by and among
the Corporation and certain of its stockholders and except for repurchases
from former employees or consultants of the Corporation at cost).

(d) Anything in this Restated Certificate of Incorporation to the contrary
notwithstanding: (i) any amendment of this Section 3 which adversely affects the holders of the
Series C Preferred Stock (regardless of whether such amendment affects the holders of all or any
other series of Preferred Stock in the same manner) shall require the affirmative vote or written
consent of two thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of the Series C Preferred
Stock, voting as a separate class, in addition to any other vote required by law or this Restated
Certificate of Incorporation and (ii) no amendment or modification of this Restated Certificate of
Incorporation shall impose any material new (or increase in a material way any existing)
obligation, liability, restriction or other duty on any holder of Series C Preferred Stock that has
not consented to such amendment or modification.

4. Optional Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion
rights as follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option
of the holder thereof, at any time and from time to time, and without the payment of additional
consideration by the holder thereof, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Common Stock as is determined by (i) in the case of the Series A Preferred Stock, dividing $0.60
by the Series A Conversion Price (as defined below) in effect at the time of conversion, (ii) in the
case of the Series B Preferred Stock, dividing $1.008 by the Series B Conversion Price (as
defined below) in effect at the tume of conversion, and (iii) in the case of the Series C Preferred
Stock, dividing $1.49 by the Series C Conversion Price (as defined below) in effect at the time of
conversion. The “Series A Conversion Price” shall initially be $0.60, the “Series B Conversion
Price” shall initially be $1.008 and the “Series C Conversion Price” shall initially be $1.49. Such
initial Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series C Conversion Price (as
applicable, the “Conversion Price”), and the rate at which shares of Series A Preferred Stock,
Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock, as applicable, may be converted into shares
of Common Stock, shall be subject to adjustment as provided below.

In the event of a notice of redemption of any shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to
Section 6 hereof, the Conversion Rights of the shares designated for redemption shall terminate
at the close of business on the last full day preceding the date fixed for redemption, unless the
redemption price is not paid on such redemption date, in which case the Conversion Rights for
such shares shal] continue until such price is paid in full. In the event of a liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the Conversion Rights shall terminate at the close
of business on the last full day preceding the date fixed for the payment of any such amounts
distributable on such event to the holders of Preferred Stock. In the event of such a redemption
or liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the Corporation shall provide to each holder of shares
of Preferred Stock notice of such redemption or liquidation, dissolution or winding up, which
notice shall (i) be sent at least 15 days prior to the termination of the Conversion Rights and (ii)
state the amount per share of Preferred Stock that will be paid or distributed on such redemption
or liquidation, dissolution or winding up, as the case may be. .

7
(b) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon
conversion of the Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would
otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the then
effective Conversion Price.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion.

(i) In order for a holder of Preferred Stock to convert shares of Preferred
Stock into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the certificate or
certificates for such shares of Preferred Stock, at the office of the transfer agent for the
Preferred Stock (or at the principal office of the Corporation if the Corporation serves as
its own transfer agent), together with written notice that such holder elects to convert all
or any number of the shares of the Preferred Stock represented by such certificate or
certificates. Such notice shall state such holder’s name or the names of the nominees in
which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be
issued. If required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall! be
endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form
satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or his or its
attorney duly authorized in writing. The date of receipt of such certificates and notice by
the transfer agent (or by the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer
agent) shall be the conversion date (‘Conversion Date’), and the shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of the shares represented by such certificate shall be
deemed to be outstanding of record as of such date. The Corporation shall, as soon as
practicable after the Conversion Date, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of
Preferred Stock, or to his or its nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of
shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled, together with cash in lieu
of any fraction of a share.

(ii) | The Corporation shail at all times when the Preferred Stock shall be
outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued stock, for the
purpose of effecting the conversion of the Preferred Stock, such number of its duly
authorized shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding Preferred Stock. Before taking any action which would
cause an adjustment reducing the Conversion Price below the then par value of the shares
of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation will
take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order
that the Corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion Price.

(iii) | Upon any such conversion, no adjustment to the Conversion Price shall be
made for any declared but unpaid dividends on the Preferred Stock surrendered for
conversion or on the Common Stock delivered upon conversion.

(iv) All shares of Preferred Stock which shall have been surrendered for
conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights
with respect to such shares, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and to vote,

8
shall immediately cease and terminate on the Conversion Date, except only the right of
the holders thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor and payment
of any dividends declared but unpaid thereon. Any shares of Preferred Stock so
converted shall be retired and cancelled and shall not be reissued, and the Corporation
(without the need for stockholder action) may from time to time take such appropriate
action as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Preferred Stock
accordingly.

(v) | The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and similar taxes that may be
payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon
conversion of shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4. The Corporation shall
not, however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer
involved in the issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than
that in which the shares of Preferred Stock so converted were registered, and no such
issuance or delivery shall be made unless and until the person or entity requesting such
issuance has paid to the Corporation the amount of any such tax or has established, to the
satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax has been paid.

(d) Adjustments to Conversion Price for Diluting Issues.

(i) Special Definitions. For purposes of this Section 4, the following
definitions shall apply:

(A) “Qption” shall mean rights, options or warrants to subscribe for,
purchase or otherwise acquire Common Stock or Convertible Securities.

(B) “Original Issue Date” shall mean the date on which a share of
Series C Preferred Stock was first issued.

(D) “Additional Shares of Common Stock” shall mean all shares of
Common Stock issued (or, pursuant to Section 4(d)(iii) below, deemed to be

recapitalization affecting such shares), issued or issuable to employees or
directors of, or consultants to, the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries
pursuant to a plan, agreement or arrangement approved by the Board of
Directors of the Corporation; provided that any Options for such shares
that expire or terminate unexercised or any restricted stock repurchased by
the Corporation shall not be counted toward such maximum number
unless and until such shares are regranted as new stock grants (or as new
Options) pursuant to the terms of any such plan, agreement or
arrangement, and provided further that such number may be increased
with the approval of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, including
the approval of the Series B Director (as defined in the Amended and
Restated Stockholders’ Voting Agreement dated on or about the date of
filing this Restated Certificate of Incorporation by and among the
Corporation and certain holders of its capital stock);

(VII) up to 1,405,226 shares of Common Stock (subject to
appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split,
combination or other similar recapitalization affecting such shares) issued
or issuable upon exercise of warrants outstanding on the Original Issue
Date and originally issued to GSI Commerce Solutions, Inc. (the “GSI
Warrant”) and Silicon Valley Bank.

No Adjustment of Conversion Price. No adjustment in the Conversion

Price shall be made as the result of the issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock
if: (a) the consideration per share (determined pursuant to Section 4(d)(v)) for such
Additional Share of Common Stock issued or deemed to be issued by the Corporation is
equal to or greater than the applicable Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the
issuance or deemed issuance of such Additional Shares of Common Stock, or (b) prior to
such issuance or deemed issuance, the Corporation receives written notice from the
holders of (i) in the case of the Series A Preferred Stock, at least a majority of the then
outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, (ii) in the case of the Series B Preferred

10
Stock, at least 60% of the then outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock, and (iii) in
the case of the Series C Preferred Stock, at least two thirds of the then outstanding shares

of the issuance or deemed issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock.

(iii) Issue of Securities Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock.

(A) _ Ifthe Corporation at any time or from time to time after the
Original Issue Date shall issue any Options or Convertible Securities (excluding
Options or Convertible Securities which, upon exercise, conversion or exchange
thereof, would entitle the holder thereof to receive shares of Common Stock
which are specifically excepted from the definition of Additional Shares of
Common Stock by Section 4(d)(i)(D) above) or shall fix a record date for the
determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive any such
Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of shares of
Common Stock (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto without regard to
any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number)
issuable upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case of Convertible
Securities and Options therefor, the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, shall be deemed to be Additional Shares of Common Stock issued as
of the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of
the close of business on such record date.

(B) If the terms of any Option or Convertible Security, the issuance of
which resulted in an adjustment to the Conversion Price pursuant to the terms of
Section 4(d)(iv) below, are revised (either automatically pursuant to the
provisions contained therein or as a result of an amendment to such terms) to
provide for either (1) any increase or decrease in the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any such
Option or Convertible Security or (2) any increase or decrease in the
consideration payable to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion or
exchange, then, effective upon such increase or decrease becoming effective, the
Conversion Price computed upon the original issue of such Option or Convertible
Security (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto) shall be
readjusted to such Conversion Price as would have obtained had such revised
terms been in effect upon the original date of issuance of such Option or
Convertible Security. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment pursuant to
this clause (B) shall have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price to an
amount which exceeds the lower of (i) the Conversion Price on the original
adjustment date, or (ii) the Conversion Price that would have resulted from any
issuances of Additional Shares of Common Stock between the original adjustment
date and such readjustment date.

(C) Ifthe terms of any Option or Convertible Security, the issuance of
which did not result in an adjustment to the Conversion Price pursuant to the
terms of Section 4(d)(iv) below (either because the consideration per share

1]
(determined pursuant to Section 4(d)(v) hereof) of the Additional Shares of
Common Stock subject thereto was equal to or greater than the applicable
Conversion Price then in effect, or because such Option or Convertible Security
was issued before the Original Issue Date), are revised after the Original Issue
Date (either automatically pursuant the provisions contained therein or as a result
of an amendment to such terms) to provide for either (1) any increase or decrease
in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion
or exchange of any such Option or Convertible Security or (2) any increase or
decrease in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon such exercise,
conversion or exchange, then such Option or Convertible Security, as so
amended, and the Additional Shares of Common Stock subject thereto
(determined in the manner provided in Section 4(d)(iii)(A) above) shall be
deemed to have been issued effective upon such increase or decrease becoming
effective.

(D) | Upon the expiration or termination of any unexercised Option or
unconverted or unexchanged Convertible Security which resulted (either upon its
original issuance or upon a revision of its terms) in an adjustment to the
Conversion Price pursuant to the terms of Section 4(d)(iv) below, the Conversion
Price shall be readjusted to such Conversion Price as would have obtained had
such Option or Convertible Security never been issued.

(E) No adjustment in the Conversion Price shall be made upon the
issue of shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities upon the exercise of
Options or the issue of shares of Common Stock upon the conversion or exchange
of Convertible Securities in accordance with their terms.

(iv) Adjustment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional Shares of
Common Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Original Issue
Date issue Additional Shares of Common Stock (including Additional Shares of
Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to Section 4(d)(ili), but excluding
Additional Shares of Common Stock issued in an initial public offering which results in
the conversion of the applicable series of Preferred Stock into Common Stock pursuant to
Section 5(a), without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the
applicable Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issue, then the
Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to
the nearest cent) determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, (x) the
numerator of which shall be (1) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to such issue plus (2) the number of shares of Common Stock which
the aggregate consideration received or to be received by the Corporation for the total
number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued would purchase at such
Conversion Price, and (y) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of such
Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued; provided that, (i) for the purpose of this
Section 4(d)(iv), all shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exchange of
Convertible Securities outstanding immediately prior to such issue shall be deemed to be

12
outstanding, and (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock deemed issuable upon
conversion or exchange of such outstanding Convertible Securities shall be determined
without giving effect to any adjustments to the conversion or exchange price or
conversion or exchange rate of such Convertible Securities resulting from the issuance of
Additional Shares of Common Stock that is the subject of this calculation.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this Section 4(d), the
consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional Shares of
Common Stock shall be computed as follows:

(A) Cash and Property: Such consideration shall:

() insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the aggregate
of cash received by the Corporation, excluding amounts paid or payable
for accrued interest;

(II) _ insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair market value thereof at the time of such issue, as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation; and

(III) in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock are issued
together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation
for consideration which covers both, be the proportion of such
consideration so received, computed as provided in clauses (J) and (II)
above, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation.

(B) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per share
received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to
have been issued pursuant to Section 4(d)(iii), relating to Options and Convertible
Securities, shall be determined by dividing

(I) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the
Corporation as consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible
Securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional
consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without
regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of
such consideration) payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such
Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, or
in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such
Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities, by

(II) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set

forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision
contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable

13
upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities.

(vi) Multiple Closing Dates. In the event the Corporation shall issue on more
than one date Additional Shares of Common Stock which are comprised of shares of the
same series or class of Preferred Stock, and such issuance dates occur within a period of
no more than 120 days, then, upon the final such issuance, the Conversion Price shall be
readjusted to give effect to all such issuances as if they occurred on the date of the final
such issuance (and without giving effect to any adjustments as a result of such prior
issuances within such period).

(e) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If the Corporation shall at any
time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date effect a subdivision of the outstanding
Common Stock or combine the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, the Conversion Price then
in effect immediately before that subdivision or combination shall be proportionately decreased.
If the Corporation shall at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date combine
the outstanding shares of Common Stock or effect a subdivision of the outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock, the Conversion Price then in effect immediately before the combination or
subdivision shall be proportionately increased. Any adjustment under this paragraph shall
become effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes
effective.

(f) Adjustment for Certain Dividends and Distributions. In the event the Corporation
at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall make or issue, or fix a record
date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other
distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock, then and in each such event the
Conversion Price then in effect immediately before such event shall be decreased as of the time
of such issuance or, in the event such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of
business on such record date, by multiplying the Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction:

(1) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close
of business on such record date, and

(11) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close
of business on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in
payment of such dividend or distribution;

provided, however, that if such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend is not fully
paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the Conversion Price shall
be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record date and thereafter the
Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this paragraph as of the time of actual payment of
such dividends or distributions; and provided further, however, that no such adjustment shall be
made if the holders of Preferred Stock simultaneously receive (i) a dividend or other distribution
of shares of Common Stock in a number equal to the number of shares of Common Stock as they

14
would have received if all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock had been converted into
Common Stock on the date of such event or (ii) a dividend or other distribution of shares of
Preferred Stock which are convertible, as of the date of such event, into such number of shares of
Common Stock as is equal to the number of additional shares of Common Stock being issued
with respect to each share of Common Stock in such dividend or distribution.

(g) Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. In the event the Corporation
at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall make or issue, or fix a record
date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other
distribution payable in securities of the Corporation (other than shares of Common Stock) or in
cash or other property (other than regular cash dividends paid out of earnings or earned surplus,
determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles), then and in each such
event provision shall be made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock shall receive upon
conversion thereof in addition to the number of shares of Common Stock receivable thereupon,
the kind and amount of securities of the Corporation, cash or other property which they would
have been entitled to receive had the Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock on the
date of such event and had they thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to and
including the conversion date, retained such securities receivable by them as aforesaid during
such period, giving application to all adjustments called for during such period under this
paragraph with respect to the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock; provided, however, that
no such adjustment shall be made if the holders of Preferred Stock simultaneously receive a
dividend or other distribution of such securities, cash or other property in an amount equal to the
amount of such securities as they would have received if all outstanding shares of Preferred
Stock had been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event.

(h) Adjustment for Merger or Reorganization, etc. Subject to the provisions of
Section 2(c), if there shall occur any reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
consolidation or merger involving the Corporation in which the Common Stock (but not the
Preferred Stock) is converted into or exchanged for securities, cash or other property (other than
a transaction covered by paragraphs (e), (f) or (g) of this Section 4), then, following any such
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger, each share of Preferred
Stock shall be convertible into the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property which a
holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation issuable upon conversion of
one share of Preferred Stock immediately prior to such reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, consolidation or merger would have been entitled to receive pursuant to such
transaction; and, in such case, appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith by the Board
of Directors of the Corporation) shall be made in the application of the provisions in this
Section 4 with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the holders of the Preferred Stock,
to the end that the provisions set forth in this Section 4 (including provisions with respect to
changes in and other adjustments of the Conversion Price) shall thereafter be applicable, as
nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any securities or other property thereafter deliverable
upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock.

(i) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation at its expense
shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable but in any event not later than 10 days thereafter,

15
compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to
each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment
(including the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property into which the Preferred
Stock is convertible) and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment
is based. The Corporation shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the written request
at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock (but in any event not later than 10 days thereafter),
furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a certificate setting forth (i) the Conversion Price
then in effect, and (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other
securities, cash or property which then would be received upon the conversion of Preferred
Stock.

(j) Notice of Record Date. In the event:

(i) the Corporation shall take a record of the holders of its Common Stock (or
other stock or securities at the time issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock) for
the purpose of entitling or enabling them to receive any dividend or other distribution, or
to receive any right to subscribe for or purchase any shares of stock of any class or any
other securities, or to receive any other right; or

(ii) | of any capital reorganization of the Corporation, any reclassification of the
Common Stock of the Corporation, any consolidation or merger of the Corporation with
or into another corporation (other than a consolidation or merger in which the
Corporation is the surviving entity and its Common Stock is not converted into or
exchanged for any other securities or property), or any transfer of all or substantially all
of the assets of the Corporation; or

(iii) | of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of
the Corporation,

then, and in each such case, the Corporation will send or cause to be sent to the holders of the
Preferred Stock a notice specifying, as the case may be, (i) the record date for such dividend,
distribution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right, or (ii)
the effective date on which such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer,
dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is to take place, and the time, if any is to be fixed, as of
which the holders of record of Common Stock (or such other stock or securities at the time
issuable upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of
Common Stock (or such other stock or securities) for securities or other property deliverable
upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer, dissolution,
liquidation or winding-up. Such notice shall be sent at least 10 business days prior to the record
date or effective date for the event specified in such notice.

5. Mandatory Conversion.

(a) Upon the Mandatory Conversion Date (as defined below), all outstanding shares
of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and/or Series C Preferred Stock, as the
case may be, shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock, at the then effective

16
conversion rate, and such shares may not be reissued by the Corporation as Series A Preferred
Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and/or Series C Preferred Stock, as the case may be. The
“Mandatory Conversion Date” shall mean, in the case of the Series A Preferred Stock, the
earliest of (i) the closing of the sale of shares of Common Stock, at a price to the public of at
least $1.20 per share (subject to appropriate adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends,
combinations and other similar recapitalizations affecting such shares) and resulting in gross
proceeds to the Corporation of at least $30,000,000, in a firm-commitment underwritten public
offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, resulting in the listing of the Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Market or the New
York Stock Exchange, (ii) a date agreed to in writing by the holders of at least 60% of the then
outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, or (iii) the date on which fewer than 60% of the
number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock originally issued in the Corporation’s offering of
Series A Preferred Stock remain outstanding. The “Mandatory Conversion Date” shall mean, in
the case of the Series B Preferred Stock, the earliest of (i) the closing of the sale of shares of
Common Stock, at a price to the public of at least $2.00 per share (subject to appropnate
adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, combinations and other similar recapitalizations
affecting such shares) and resulting in gross proceeds to the Corporation of at least $30,000,000,
in a firm-commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, resulting in the listing of the Common Stock on
the Nasdaq Global Market or the New York Stock Exchange, (ii) a date agreed to in writing by
the holders of at least 60% of the then outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock, or (iii) the
date on which fewer than one-third of the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock
originally issued in the Corporation’s offering of Series B Preferred Stock remain outstanding.
The “Mandatory Conversion Date” shall mean, in the case of the Series C Preferred Stock, the
earliest of (i) the closing of the sale of shares of Common Stock, at a price to the public of at
least $3.00 per share (subject to appropriate adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends,
combinations and other similar recapitalizations affecting such shares) and resulting in gross
proceeds to the Corporation of at least $30,000,000, in a firm-commitment underwritten public
offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, resulting in the listing of the Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Market or the New
York Stock Exchange, (ii) a date agreed to in writing by the holders of at least two thirds of the
then outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock, or (iii) the date on which fewer than
one-third of the number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock originally issued in the
Corporation’s offering of Series C Preferred Stock remain outstanding, provided that for the
purpose of making any determination under this clause (iii), shares of Series C Preferred Stock
that have been or may be issued pursuant to the exercise of the GSI Warrant shall be considered
to have been issued in such Series C Preferred Stock offering and to be outstanding.

(b) — All holders of record of shares of Preferred Stock shall be given written notice of
the Mandatory Conversion Date and the place designated for mandatory conversion of all such
shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 5. Such notice need not be given in advance of
the occurrence of the Mandatory Conversion Date. Such notice shall be sent by first class or
registered mail, postage prepaid, or given by electronic communication in compliance with the
provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, to each record holder of Preferred Stock.
Upon receipt of such notice, each holder of shares of Preferred Stock shall surrender his or its
certificate or certificates for all such shares to the Corporation at the place designated in such

17
notice, and shall thereafter receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Section 5. On a Mandatory Conversion Date, all
outstanding shares of the series of Preferred Stock to which such Mandatory Conversion Date
applies shall be deemed to have been converted into shares of Common Stock, which shall be
deemed to be outstanding of record, and all rights with respect to the Preferred Stock so
converted, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and vote (other than as a holder of
Common Stock) wil! terminate, except only the rights of the holders thereof, upon surrender of
their certificate or certificates therefor, to receive certificates for the number of shares of
Common Stock into which such Preferred Stock has been converted, and payment of any
declared but unpaid dividends thereon. If so required by the Corporation, certificates
surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by written instrument or
instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered
holder or by his or its attorney duly authorized in writing. As soon as practicable after the
Mandatory Conversion Date and the surrender of the certificate or certificates for Preferred
Stock, the Corporation shall cause to be issued and delivered to such holder, or on his or its
written order, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable
on such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof and cash as provided in

Section 4(b) in respect of any fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such
conversion.

(c) All certificates evidencing shares of Preferred Stock which are required to be
surrendered for conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof shall, from and after the
Mandatory Conversion Date, be deemed to have been retired and cancelled and the shares of
Preferred Stock represented thereby converted into Common Stock for all purposes,
notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender such certificates on or
prior to such date. Such converted Preferred Stock may not be reissued, and the Corporation
may thereafter take such appropriate action (without the need for stockholder action) as may be
necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Preferred Stock accordingly.

6. Redemption.

(a) Mandatory Redemption; Three Installments. Shares of Preferred Stock shall be
redeemed by the Corporation at a price equal to the Redemption Price (as defined below) in three
equal annual installments with the first installment payable 60 days after receipt by the
Corporation at any time on or after the seventh anniversary of the date on which a share of
Series C Preferred Stock was first issued, from the holders of at least a majority of the then
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together on as-converted basis as a single class, of
written notice requesting redemption of all shares of Preferred Stock (the date of each such
installment being referred to as a “Redemption Date”). On each Redemption Date, the
Corporation shall redeem that number of outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, on a series by
series basis, determined by dividing (i) the total number of shares of each series of Preferred
Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Redemption Date by (ii) the number of remaining
Redemption Dates (including the Redemption Date to which such calculation applies). If the
Corporation does not have sufficient funds legally available to redeem the Preferred Stock on
any Redemption Date, the Corporation shall redeem a pro rata portion of each holder’s shares of
Preferred Stock (in proportion to the respective amounts which would otherwise be payable in

18
respect of the shares of Preferred Stock held by a holder thereof upon such redemption if all such
shares werc redeemed in full) out of funds legally available therefor and shall redeem the
remaining shares to have been redeemed as soon as practicable after the Corporation has funds
legally available therefor. The “Redemption Price” shall equal $0.60 per share in the case of the
Series A Preferred Stock, $1.008 per share in the case of the Series B Preferred Stock and $1.49
per share in the case of the Series C Preferred Stock, in each case plus all declared but unpaid
dividends thereon and subject to appropriate adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends,
combinations and other similar recapitalizations affecting such shares. If the Corporation does
not redeem any shares of Preferred Stock when required (including, without limitation because it
does not have sufficient funds legally available), the Redemption Price for all shares not
redeemed when required shall bear interest at a monthly rate of one percent (1%) from the
applicable Redemption Date through the date such shares are actually redeemed.

(b) Redemption Notice. Written notice of the mandatory redemption (the
“Redemption Notice”) shall be mailed, postage prepaid, to each holder of record of Preferred
Stock, at its post office address last shown on the records of the Corporation, or given by
electronic communication in compliance with the provisions of the Delaware General
Corporation Law, not less than 30 days prior to each Redemption Date. Each Redemption
Notice shall state:

(ft) the number of shares of Preferred Stock held by the holder that the
Corporation shall redeem on the Redemption Date specified in the Redemption Notice;

(II) the Redemption Date and the Redemption Price;

(III) _ the date upon which the holder’s nght to convert such shares terminates
(as determined in accordance with Section 4(a)); and

(IV) _ that the holder is to surrender to the Corporation, in the manner and at the
place designated, his certificate or certificates representing the shares of Preferred Stock
to be redeemed.

(c) Surrender of Certificates; Payment. On or before the applicable Redemption
Date, each holder of shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such Redemption Date, unless
such holder has exercised his right to convert such shares as provided in Section 4 hereof, shall
surrender the certificate or certificates representing such shares to the Corporation, in the manner
and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice, and thereupon the Redemption Price for
such shares shall be payable to the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or
certificates as the owner thereof, and each surrendered certificate shall be canceled and retired.
In the event less than all of the shares of Preferred Stock represented by a certificate are
redeemed, a new certificate representing the unredeemed shares of Preferred Stock shall
promptly be issued.

(d) Rights Subsequent to Redemption. Ifthe Redemption Notice shall have been
duly given, and if on the applicable Redemption Date the Redemption Price payable upon
redemption of the shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such Redemption Date is paid or

19
tendered for payment, then notwithstanding that the certificates evidencing any of the shares of
Preferred Stock so called for redemption shall not have been surrendered, dividends with respect
to such shares of Preferred Stock shall cease to accrue after such Redemption Date and all rights
with respect to such shares shall forthwith after the Redemption Date terminate, except only the
right of the holders to receive the Redemption Price without interest upon surrender of their
certificate or certificates therefor.

(e) Redeemed or Otherwise Acquired Shares. Any shares of Preferred Stock which
are redeemed or otherwise acquired by the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries shall be
automatically and immediately canceled and shall not be reissued, sold or transferred as shares of
Preferred Stock. Neither the Corporation nor any of its subsidiaries may exercise any voting or
other rights granted to the holders of Preferred Stock.

7. Waiver. Any of the rights of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock set forth
herein may be waived by the affirmative consent or vote of the holders of at least a majority of
the shares of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding, any of the rights of the holders of Series
B Preferred Stock set forth herein may be waived by the affirmative consent or vote of the
holders of at least 60% of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock then outstanding, and any of the
rights of the holders of Series C Preferred Stock set forth herein may be waived by the
affirmative consent or vote of the holders of at least two thirds of the shares of Series C Preferred
Stock then outstanding.

FIFTH: In furtherance of and not in limitation of powers conferred by statute, it is
further provided:

1, The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under
the direction of the Board of Directors.

2. Election of directors need not be by written ballot.

3. The Board of Directors is expressly authorized to adopt, amend, alter or
repeal the By-Laws of the Corporation.

SIXTH: Except to the extent that the General Corporation Law of Delaware prohibits the
elimination or limitation of liability of directors for breaches of fiduciary duty, no director of the
Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary
damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director, notwithstanding any provision of law
imposing such liability. No amendment to or repeal of this provision shall apply to or have any
effect on the liability or alleged liability of any director of the Corporation for or with respect to
any acts or omissions of such director occurring prior to such amendment.

SEVENTH: The Corporation shall provide indemnification as follows:
1. Actions, Suits and Proceedings Other than by or in the Right of the Corporation.
The Corporation shall indemnify each person who was or is a party or threatened to be made a

party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,

20
administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by
reason of the fact that he or she is or was, or has agreed to become, a director or officer of the
Corporation, or is or was serving, or has agreed to serve, at the request of the Corporation, as a
director, officer, partner, employee or trustee of, or in a similar capacity with, another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit
plan) (all such persons being referred to hereafter as an “‘Indemnitee’’), or by reason of any action
alleged to have been taken or omitted in such capacity, against all expenses (including attorneys’
fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by or on
behalf of Indemnitee in connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal
therefrom, if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably
believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any
criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was
unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement,
conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a
presumption that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee
reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, and, with
respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his or her
conduct was unlawful.

2. Actions or Suits by or in the Right of the Corporation. The Corporation shall

indemnify any Indemnitee who was or is a party to or threatened to be made a party to any
threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a
judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that Indemnitee is or was, or has agreed to become, a
director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving, or has agreed to serve, at the request
of the Corporation, as a director, officer, partner, employee or trustee of, or in a similar capacity
with, another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any
employee benefit plan), or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in such
capacity, against all expenses (including attorneys’ fees) and, to the extent permitted by law,
amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in
connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if Indemnitee acted in
good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the
best interests of the Corporation, except that no indemnification shall be made under this Section
2 in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which Indemnitee shall have been adjudged to be
liable to the Corporation, unless, and only to the extent, that the Court of Chancery of Delaware
shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of such liability but in view of all
the circumstances of the case, Indemnitee is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such
expenses (including attorneys’ fees) which the Court of Chancery of Delaware shall deem
proper.

3. Indemnification for Expenses of Successful Party. Notwithstanding any other
provisions of this Article, to the extent that an Indemnitee has been successful, on the merits or

otherwise, in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Sections 1 and 2 of this

Article, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, or on appeal from any such action,
suit or proceeding, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all expenses (including attorneys’
fees) actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection therewith.

21
4. Notification and Defense of Claim. As a condition precedent to an Indemnitee’s
right to be indemnified, such Indemnitee must notify the Corporation in writing as soon as
practicable of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation involving such Indemnitee for which
indemnity will or could be sought. With respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation
of which the Corporation is so notified, the Corporation will be entitled to participate therein at
its own expense and/or to assume the defense thereof at its own expense, with legal counsel
reasonably acceptable to Indemnitee. After notice from the Corporation to Indemnitee of its
election so to assume such defense, the Corporation shall not be liable to Indemnitee for any
legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by Indemnitee in connection with such action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, other than as provided below in this Section 4. Indemnitee shall
have the right to employ his or her own counsel in connection with such action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, but the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred after notice from the
Corporation of its assumption of the defense thereof shall be at the expense of Indemnitee unless
(i) the employment of counsel by Indemnitee has been authorized by the Corporation,

(ii) counsel to Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest
ot position on any significant issue between the Corporation and Indemnitee in the conduct of
the defense of such action, suit, proceeding or investigation or (iii) the Corporation shall not in
fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of such action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel for Indemnitee shall be at
the expense of the Corporation, except as otherwise expressly provided by this Article. The
Corporation shall not be entitled, without the consent of Indemnitee, to assume the defense of
any claim brought by or in the right of the Corporation or as to which counsel for Indemnitee
shall have reasonably made the conclusion provided for in clause (i1) above. The Corporation
shall not be required to indemnify Indemnitee under this Article for any amounts paid in
settlement of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation effected without its written consent.
The Corporation shall not settle any action, suit, proceeding or investigation in any manner
which would impose any penalty or limitation on Indemnitee without Indemnitee’s written
consent. Neither the Corporation nor Indemnitee will unreasonably withhold or delay its consent
to any proposed settlement.

5. Advance of Expenses. Subject to the provisions of Section 6 of this Article, in the
event that the Corporation does not assume the defense pursuant to Section 4 of this Article of
any action, suit, proceeding or investigation of which the Corporation receives notice under this
Article, any expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by or on behalf of an Indemnitee in
defending an action, suit, proceeding or investigation or any appeal therefrom shall be paid by
the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such matter; provided, however, that the
payment of such expenses incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in advance of the final
disposition of such matter shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of
Indemnitee to repay all amounts so advanced in the event that it shal] ultimately be determined
that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article;
and further provided that no such advancement of expenses shall be made under this Article if it
is determined (in the manner described in Section 6) that (i) Indemnitee did not act in good faith
and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the
Corporation, or (ii) with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, Indemnitee had reasonable
cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. Such undertaking shall be accepted without
reference to the financial ability of Indemnitee to make such repayment.

22
6. Procedure for Indemnification. In order to obtain indemnification or
advancement of expenses pursuant to Section 1, 2, 3 or 5 of this Article, an Indemnitee shall
submit to the Corporation a written request. Any such advancement of expenses shall be made
promptly, and in any event within 30 days after receipt by the Corporation of the written request
of Indemnitee, unless the Corporation determines within such 30-day period that Indemnitee did
not meet the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1, 2 or 5 of this Article, as the
case may be. Any such indemnification, unless ordered by a court, shall be made with respect to
requests under Section 1 or 2 only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination by the
Corporation that the indemnification of Indemnitee is proper because Indemnitee has met the
applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section | or 2, as the case may be. Such
determination shall be made in each instance (a) by a majority vote of the directors of the
Corporation consisting of persons who are not at that time parties to the action, suit or
proceeding in question (“disinterested directors”), whether or not a quorum, (b) by a committee
of disinterested directors designated by majority vote of disinterested directors, whether or not a
quorum, (c) if there are no disinterested directors, or if the disinterested directors so direct, by
independent legal counsel (who may, to the extent permitted by law, be regular legal counsel to
the Corporation) in a written opinion, or (d) by the stockholders of the Corporation.

7. Remedies. The right to indemnification or advancement of expenses as granted
by this Article shall be enforceable by Indemnitee in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Neither the failure of the Corporation to have made a determination prior to the commencement
of such action that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met
the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Corporation pursuant to
Section 6 of this Article that Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall
be a defense to the action or create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met the applicable
standard of conduct. Indemnitee’s expenses (including attorneys’ fees) reasonably incurred in
connection with successfully establishing Indemnitee’s right to indemnification, in whole or in
part, in any such proceeding shall also be indemnified by the Corporation.

8. Limitations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article, except as
set forth in Section 7 of the Article, the Corporation shall not indemnify an Indemnitee pursuant
to this Article in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such Indemnitee
unless the initiation thereof was approved by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article, the Corporation shall not indemnify an
Indemnitee to the extent such Indemnitee is reimbursed from the proceeds of insurance, and in
the event the Corporation makes any indemnification payments to an Indemnitee and such
Indemnitee is subsequently reimbursed from the proceeds of insurance, Indemnitee shall
promptly refund such indemnification payments to the Corporation to the extent of such
insurance reimbursement.

9. Subsequent Amendment. No amendment, termination or repeal of this Article or
of the relevant provisions of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or any other applicable
laws shall affect or diminish in any way the rights of any Indemnitee to indemnification under
the provisions hereof with respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of
or relating to any actions, transactions or facts occurring prior to the final adoption of such
amendment, termination or repeal. If the General Corporation Law of Delaware is amended after

23
adoption of this Article to expand further the indemnification permitted to Indemnitees, then the
Corporation shall indemnify such persons to the fullest extent permitted by the General
Corporation Law of Delaware, as so amended.

10. Qther Rights. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by this
Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnitee seeking
indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any law (common or
statutory), agreement or vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to
action in Indemnitee’s official capacity and as to action in any other capacity while holding
office for the Corporation, and shal} continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director
or officer, and shall inure to the benefit of the estate, heirs, executors and administrators of
Indemnitee. Nothing contained in this Article shall be deemed to prohibit, and the Corporation is
specifically authorized to enter into, agreements with officers and directors providing
indemnification nghts and procedures different from those set forth in this Article. In addition,
the Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by its Board of Directors, grant
indemnification rights to other employees or agents of the Corporation or other persons serving
the Corporation and such rights may be equivalent to, or greater or less than, those set forth in
this Article.

11. Partial Indemnification. If an Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this
Article to indemnification by the Corporation for some or a portion of the expenses (including
attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred
by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation
and any appeal therefrom but not, however, for the total amount thereof, the Corporation shall
nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee for the portion of such expenses (including attorneys’ fees),
judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement to which Indemnitee is entitled.

12. Insurance. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance, at its expense,
to protect itself and any director, officer, employce or agent of the Corporation or another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit
plan) against any expense, liability or loss incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of
his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such
person against such expense, liability or loss under the General Corporation Law of Delaware.

13. | Merger or Consolidation. If the Corporation is merged into or consolidated with
another corporation and the Corporation is not the surviving corporation, the surviving
corporation shall assume the obligations of the Corporation under this Article with respect to any
action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or relating to any actions, transactions or
facts occurring prior to the date of such merger or consolidation.

14. Savings Clause. If this Article or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any
ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify
each Indemnitee as to any expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts
paid in settlement in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal or administrative, including an action by or in the right of the Corporation, to the fullest

24
extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article that shall not have been invalidated and
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

15. Definitions. Terms used herein and defined in Section 145(h) and Section 145(i)
of the General Corporation Law of Delaware shall have the respective meanings assigned to such
terms in such Section 145(h) and Section 145().
