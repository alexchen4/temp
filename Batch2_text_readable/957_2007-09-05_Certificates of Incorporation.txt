3953063_5.DOC
C Preferred Stock (the “Series C Preferred Stock” and, together with the Series A Preferred Stock
and the Series B Preferred Stock, the ‘Preferred Stock”).

The relative rights, preferences, privileges, limitations and restrictions granted to or imposed
on the respective classes and series of the shares of capital stock or the holders thereof are as
follows:

4.1 Dividends. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive dividends
on a pari passu basis when, as and if declared by the Corporation's Board of Directors, out of any
assets legally available therefor, prior and in preference to any declaration or payment of any
dividend (payable other than in Common Stock or other securities or rights convertible into, or
entitling the holder thereof to receive directly or indirectly, additional! shares of Common Stock
(“Common Stock Equivalents”)) on the Corporation’s Common Stock. Upon conversion of any
share of any series of Preferred Stock pursuant to subsection (A) or (B) of Section 4.3, all dividends
declared but unpaid on such share shal] be paid in cash or, upon the approval of a majority of the
Board of Directors, shares of Common Stock at the then fair market value as determined in good
faith by the Corporation’s Board of Directors. No dividends shall be declared or paid, and no
distribution shall be made, on any shares of Common Stock unless all dividends declared but unpaid
on any series of Preferred Stock have been paid or set apart for payment. After the payment or
setting aside for payment of the dividends described in the first sentence of this Section 4.1, any
additional dividends (payable other than in Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents) declared
or paid in any year shall be distributed ratably to the holders of Common Stock and Preferred Stock
based on the number of shares of Common Stock which would be held by each such holder if all
shares of Preferred Stock were converted at the then-effective Conversion Rate.

4.2 Liquidation Preference.

(A) Preferred Stock Preference. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation, either voluntary or involuntary, the holders of Preferred Stock shall
be entitled to receive, on a pari passu basis and prior and in preference to any distribution of any of
the Corporation’s assets or surplus funds to the holders of the Corporation’s Common Stock by
reason of their ownership thereof, (i) an amount for each share of Series A Preferred Stock equal to
$0.6815 per share (as adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split, combination, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification or other similar event with respect to such share) (the “Series A
Original Issue Price”) plus an additional amount equal to any dividends declared but unpaid on each
such share, (ij) an amount for each share of Series B Preferred Stock equal to $1.7531 per share (as
adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split, combination, reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification or other similar event with respect to such share) (the “Series B Original Issue
Price”) plus an additional amount cqual to any dividends declared but unpaid on each such share and
(iii) an amount for each share of Series C Preferred Stock equal to $5.48453 per share (as adjusted
for any stock dividend, stock split, combination, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or
similar event with respect to such share) (the “Series C Original Issue Price”) plus an additional
amount cqual to any dividends declared but unpaid on each such share. If, upon such liquidation,
dissolution or winding up, the assets and funds distributed are insufficient to permit the payment to
each holder of Preferred Stock of the full aforesaid preferential amount, the entire assets and funds

3953063_5.D0C -2-
legally available for distribution shall be distributed ratably among the holders of the Preferred Stock
in proportion to the full preferential amounts to which they would otherwise be entitled.

(B) Remaining Assets. Upon the completion of the distribution required by
subsection (A) of this Section 4.2, all of the Corporation’s remaining assets or funds available for
distribution to stockholders shall be distributed ratably to the holders of Common Stock based on the
number of shares of Common Stock held by each such holder,

(C) (1) | For the purposes of this Section 4.2, a liquidation, dissolution or

- winding up of the Corporation shal] be deemed to include (X) the acquisition of the Corporation by
another entity by means of any transaction or series of related transactions (including, without
limitation, any merger, consolidation or other form of reorganization in which outstanding shares of
the Corporation are exchanged for securities or other consideration issued, or caused to be issued, by
the acquiring entity or its subsidiary, but excluding any transaction effected primarily for the purpose
of changing the Corporation’s jurisdiction of incorporation), unless the Corporation’s stockholders
of record as constituted immediately prior to such transaction or series of related transactions will,
immediately after such transaction or series of related transactions hold at least a majority of the
voting power of the surviving or acquiring entity exclusively by virtue of shares received in such
transaction or series of related transactions with respect to shares of the Corporation’s capital stock
or (Y) a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation or the exclusive licensing of all
or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation in a single transaction or series of related
transactions, The treatment of any transaction or series of related transactions as a liquidation,
dissolution or winding up pursuant to clause (X) or (Y) of the preceding sentence may be waived by
the holders of a majority of the Preferred Stock then outstanding (voting together as a single class on
an as-converted basis); provided, however, that with respect to any transaction or series of related
transactions in which (i) the holders of Series A Preferred Stock would receive in respect of the
Series A Preferred Stock held by them as a result of such transaction or series of related transactions
an amount per share of Series A Preferred Stock that is less than Series A Original Issue Price, then
the separate written consent of the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of the Series
A Preferred Stock (voting as a separate series) shall be required in connection with such waiver, (ii)
the holders of Series B Preferred Stock would receive in respect of the Series B Preferred Stock held
by them as a result of such transaction or series of related transactions an amount per share of Series
B Preferred Stock that is less than Series B Original Issue Price, then the separate written consent of
the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of the Series B Preferred Stock (voting as a
separate series) shall be required in connection with such waiver, and (iii) the holders of Series C
Preferred Stock would receive in respect of the Series C Preferred Stock held by them as a result of
such transaction or series of related transactions an amount per share of Series C Preferred Stock that
is less than Series C Original Issue Price, then the separate written consent of the holders of a

majority of the then-outstanding shares of the Series C Preferred Stock (voting as a separate series)
shall be required in connection with such waiver.

(2) If any assets of the Corporation distributed to stockholders in
connection with any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation are other than cash,
then the value of such assets shall be their fair market value as determined in good faith by the
Corporation’s Board of Directors; provided, however, any publicly traded securities that are not
subject to investment letter or other restrictions on free marketability shall be valued as follows:

3953063_$.DOC -3-
(a) if the securities are then traded on a national securities
exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market (or a similar national quotation system), then the value of the
securities shall be deemed to be to the average of the closing prices of the securities on such

exchange or system over the ten (10) trading day period ending five (5) trading days prior to the
distribution; and

(b) if the securities are actively traded over-the-counter, then the
value of the securities shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid prices of the securities
over the ten (10) trading day period ending five (5) trading days prior to the distribution.

(3) In the event the requirements of this subsection (C) are not complied
with, the Corporation shall forthwith either:

(a) cause such closing to be postponed until such time as the
requirements of this Section 4.2 have been complied with, or

(b) cancel such transaction, in which event the rights, preferences,
privileges and restrictions of the holders of Preferred Stock shall revert to and be the same as such
rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions existing immediately prior to the date of the first
notice referred to in subsection (C}(4).

(4) | The Corporation shall give each holder of record of Preferred Stock

written notice of a transaction described in subsection (C){1) not later than twenty (20) days prior to
the stockholders’ meeting called to approve such transaction, or twenty (20) days prior to the closing
of such transaction, whichever is earlier, and shall also notify such holders in writing of the final
approval of such transaction. The first of such notices shall describe the material terms and
conditions of the impending transaction and the provisions of this Section 4.2, and the Corporation
shall thereafter give such holders prompt notice of any material changes. The transaction shall in no
event take place sooner than twenty (20) days after the Corporation has given the first notice
provided for herein or sooner than ten (10) days after the Corporation has given notice of any
material changes provided for herein; provided, however, that each of the periods in this subsection
(C)(4) may be shortened or eliminated upon the written consent of the holders of a majority of the
shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding, voting together as a single class.

4.3 Conversion. The holders of Preferred Stock have conversion rights as follows:

(A) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shal] be convertible, at the
option of the holder thercof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share and on or prior to the
business day prior to the Redemption Date, if any, as may have been fixed in any Redemption
Notice with respect to such share of Preferred Stock, at the office of the Corporation or any transfer
agent for the Preferred Stock, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common
Stock as is determined (i) with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock by dividing the Series A
Original Issue Price by the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock, determined as
hereinafter provided, in effect at the time of the conversion (the “Series A Conversion Rate”), (ii)
with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock by dividing the Series B Original Issue Price by the
Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock, determined as hereinafter provided, in effect at

3953063_$.D0C -4-
the time of conversion (the “Serjes B Conversion Rate”) and (iii) with respect to the Series C
Preferred Stock by dividing the Series C Original Issue Price by the Conversion Price for such series
of Preferred Stock, determined as hereinafter provided, in effect at the time of the conversion (the
“Series C Conversion Rate”). The term “Conversion Rate” as used herein, shall refer to the
respective conversion rate for each series of Preferred Stock. The term “Conversion Price” as used
herein, shall refer to the respective conversion price for each series of Preferred Stock. The initial
“Series A Conversion Price” per share for the Series A Preferred Stock shall be $0.6815, the initial
“Series B Conversion Price” per share for the Series B Preferred Stock shal] be $1.7531 and the
initial “Series C Conversion Price” per share for the Series C Preferred Stock shall be $5.48453.
Such initial Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment as provided in subsection (D) of this
Section 4.3.

(B) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be
converted into fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock into which it is then
convertible upon the earliest of (i) immediately prior to the closing of a firm commitment
underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), covering the offer and sale of Common Stock to the
public in which the public offering price (prior to underwriter’s discounts or commissions and
offering expenses) exceeds $10.97 per share of Common Stock (as adjusted for any stock dividend,
stock split, combination, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other similar event with
respect to the Common Stock) and the aggregate gross proceeds raised exceeds $20,000,000 (a
“Qualified IPO”), (ii) upon the receipt by the Corporation of a written request for such conversion
from the holders of a majority of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C
Preferred Stock then outstanding (each voting as a separate series) or, if later, the effective date for
conversion specified in such request and (iii) immediately prior to the closing of a liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation (including a deemed a liquidation under Section
4.2(C)) if the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (voting together
as a single class on an as-converted basis) so specify in writing; provided, however, that with respect
to any liquidation, dissolution or winding up referred to in (iii) above in which (A) the holders of
Series A Preferred Stock would receive in respect of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by
them as a result of such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation an amount per
share less than Series A Original Issue Price, then the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock shall
not so automatically convert without the separate written consent of the holders of a majority of the
then-outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock (voting as a separate series), (B) the holders of
Series B Preferred Stock would receive in respect of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock held by
them as a result of such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation an amount per

so automatically convert without the separate written consent of the holders of a majority of the
then-outstanding shares of the Series B Preferred Stock (voting as a separate series), and (C) the
holders of Series C Preferred Stock would receive in respect of the shares of Series C Preferred
Stock held by them as a result of such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation an
amount per share less than Series C Original Issue Price, then the shares of the Series C Preferred
Stock shall not so automatically convert without the separate written consent of the holders of a
majority of the then-outstanding shares of the Series C Preferred Stock (voting as a separate series).

(each of the events referred to in (i), (ii) and (iii) are referred to herein as an “Automatic Conversion
Event”).

3953063_5.DOC -5-
(C) Mechanics of Conversion.

(1) Before any holder of Preferred Stock shal] be entitled to convert the
same into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates
therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for the Preferred
Stock, and shall give written notice to the Corporation at such office that such holder elects to
convert the same and shall state thercin the name or names in which such holder wishes the
certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued. Such conversion shall be
deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of surrender of the
shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder
or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date; provided, however, that on the date of an
Automatic Conversion Event, the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted
automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and each holder of record of
shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed on such date to be the holder of record of the Common
Stock issuable upon such conversion, whether or not (i) the certificates representing such shares are
surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent, (ii) notice from the Corporation shall have been
received by any holder of record of shares of Preferred Stock, or (iii) the certificates evidencing such
shares of Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered to such holder; provided further,
however, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such Automatic Conversion Event unless either the certificates
evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent as
provided above, or the holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have
been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to
indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates. The
Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after such delivery, or after such agreement and
indemnification, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, (a) a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which he shall be entitled as aforesaid, (b)
a check payable to the holder in the amount of any cash amounts payable as the result of a
conversion into fractional shares of Common Stock and (c) a check payable to the holder in the
amount of any cash amounts or a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common
Stock issuable with respect to declared and unpaid dividends on the converted Preferred Stock
pursuant to Section 4.1.

(2) If the conversion is in connection with an underwritten offer of
securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act, a transaction described in Section 4.2(C)(1),
merger, sale, financing, or liquidation of the Corporation or other event, the conversion may, at the
option of any holder tendering Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing of
such transaction or upon the occurrence of such event, in which case the person(s) entitled to receive
the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have
converted such Preferred Stock immediately prior to the closing of such transaction or the
occurrence of such event.

{D) Adjustment of Conversion Price. The Conversion Price for the Series A
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment
from time to time as follows:

3953063_5.DOC -6-
(1) (a) If the Corporation shail issue, after the date of filing of this
Restated Certificate, any Additional Stock (as defined in subsection (D)(2)) without consideration or
for a consideration per share less than the Conversion Price for a series of Preferred Stock in effect
immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock, the Conversion Price for such series in
effect immediately prior to each such issuance of Additional Stock shal] forthwith (except as
otherwise provided in this subsection (D)) be adjusted to a price equal to (calculated to the nearest
cent) the product obtained by multiplying the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock in
effect immediately prior to such issuance of Additional Stock by a fraction, the numerator of which
is equal to the sum of (x) the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any
shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to subsection (D){! Xe){i) or (ii) of this
Section 4.3) immediately prior to such issuance of Additional Stock plus {y) the number of shares of
Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received by this Corporation for such issuance of
Additional Stock would purchase at the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock in effect
immediately prior to such issuance of Additional Stock, and the denominator of which is equal to the
sum of (x) the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any shares of
Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to subsection (D){1)(e)(i) or (ii) of this Section 4.3)
immediately prior to such issuance of Additional Stock plus (y) the number of shares of Additional
Stock issued.

(b) No adjustment in the Conversion Price for a series of Preferred
Stock need be made if such adjustment would result in a change in the Conversion Price of less than
$0.01. Any adjustment of less than $0.01 that is not made shall be carried forward and shall be made
at the time of and together with any subsequent adjustment that, on a cumulative basis, amounts to
an adjustment of $0.01 or more in the Conversion Price. Except to the limited extent provided for in
subsections (D)(1)(eXiii) or (iv), no adjustment of the Conversion Price for a series of Preferred
Stock pursuant to this subsection (D)(1) shall have the effect of increasing any such Conversion
Price above the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment.

(c) In the case of the issuance of Additional Stock for cash, the
consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting any discounts,
commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the Corporation for any underwriting or
otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

(d) In the case of the issuance of Additional Stock for a
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be deemed
to be the fair value thereof as determined in good faith by the Corporation’s Board of Directors
irrespective of any accounting treatment.

(e) In the case of the issuance (whether before, on or after the date
of filing of this Restated Certificate) of (i) options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common
Stock, (ii) securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock or
(iii) options to purchase or rights to subscribe for securities by their terms convertible into or
exchangeable for Common Stock, the following provisions shall apply for all purposes of
subsections (D)(1) and (2):

3953063_5.DOC -7-
(i) The aggregate maximum number of shares of Common
Stock deliverable upon exercise (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to exercisability,
including, without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account potential
antidilution adjustments) of such options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common Stock shall
be deemed to have been issued at the time such options or rights were issued and for a consideration
equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in subsections (D)(1)(c) and
(D)(1)(d)), if any, received by the Corporation upon the issuance of such options or rights plus the
minimum exercise price provided in such options or rights (without taking into account potential
antidilution adjustments) for the Common Stock covered thereby.

(ii) | The aggregate maximum number of shares of Common
Stock deliverable upon conversion of or in exchange (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to
convertibility or exchangeability, including without limitation, the passage of time, but without
taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) for any such convertible or exchangeable
securities or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or
exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof shall be deemed to have
been issued at the time such securities were issued or such options or rights were issued and for a
consideration equal to the consideration, if any, received by the Corporation for any such securities
and related options or rights (excluding any cash received on account of accrued interest or accrued
dividends), plus the minimum additional consideration, if any, to be received by the Corporation
(without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) upon the conversion or exchange of
such securities or the exercise of any related options or rights (the consideration in each case to be
determined in the manner provided in subsections (D)(1)(c) and (D){1}(d)).

(iil) In the event of any change in the number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to this Corporation upon exercise of such
options or rights or upon conversion of or exchange for such convertible or exchangeable securities,
including, but not limited to, a change resulting from the antidilution provisions thereof, the
Conversion Price for a series of Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or computed
using such options, rights or securities, shall be recomputed to reflect such change, but no further
adjustment shall be made for the actual issuance of Common Stock or any payment of such

consideration upon the exercise of any such options or rights or the conversion or exchange of such
securities.

(iv) Upon the expiration of any such options or rights, the
termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options or rights
related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Conversion Price for a series of Preferred
Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, rights or securities or
options or rights related to such securities, shall be recomputed to reflect the issuance of only the
number of shares of Common Stock (and convertible or exchangeable securities that remain in
effect) actually issued upon the exercise of such options or rights, upon the conversion or exchange
of such securities or upon the exercise of the options or rights related to such securities,

(v) | The number of shares of Common Stock deemed issued
and the consideration decmed paid therefor pursuant to subsections (D)(1)(e)(i) and (ii) shall be

3953063_5.DOC -8-
appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or expiration of the type described in either
subsection (D)(1)(eXiii) or (iv).

(2) ‘Additional Stock” shall mean any shares of Common Stock issued (or
deemed to have been issued pursuant to subsection (D}{1)(e) of this Section 4.3) by this Corporation

(3) Subdivision, etc. In the event this Corporation should at any time or
from time to time after the date of filing of this Restated Certificate, fix a record date for the
effectuation of a split or subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or the
determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution
payable in additional shares of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents without payment of
any consideration by such holder for the additional shares of Common Stock or the Common Stock
Equivalents (including the additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise
thereof), then, as of such record date (or the date of such dividend distribution, split or subdivision if
no record date is fixed), the Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred
Stock and Series C Preferred Stock shall be appropriately decreased so that the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be increased in proportion
to such increase of the aggregate of shares of Common Stock outstanding and those issuable with
respect to such Common Stock Equivalents.

(4) Combination. If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
at any time after the date of filing of this Restated Certificate is decreased by a combination of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock, then, on the effective date of such combination, the
Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred
Stock shall be appropriately increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on
conversion of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C
Preferred Stock shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares of Common
Stock.

(E) Other Distributions. In the event the Corporation shall declare a distribution
payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by this Corporation or other
persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred to in subsection (D)(3) of
this Section 4.3, then, in each such case for the purpose of this subsection (E), the holders of
Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a
proportionate share of any such distribution as though they were the holders of the number of shares
of Common Stock of the Corporation into which their respective shares of Series A Preferred Stock,
Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock are convertible as of the record date fixed for
the determination of the holders of Common Stock of the Corporation entitled to receive such
distribution.

(F)  Recapitalizations. If, at any time or from time to time after the date of filing
of this Restated Certificate, there shall be a recapitalization of the Corporation’s Common Stock
(other than (x) a subdivision or combination provided for in subsections (D)(3) or (D){4) of this
Section 4.3 or (y) a deemed liquidation, dissolution or winding up pursuant to in Section 4.2(C))
provision shall be made so that the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and
Series C Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of such Preferred
Stock the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the Corporation or otherwise,
to which a holder of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock,
Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock would have been entitled on such
recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the
provisions of this Section 4.3 with respect to the rights of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock,
Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock after the recapitalization to the end that the

3953063_5.DOC -10-
provisions of this Section 4.3 (including adjustment of the Conversion Price then in effect and the

~ gumber of shares issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock

and Series C Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event as nearly equivalent as prior to that

Preferred Stock (a “Redemption Request”), the Corporation shal] redeem all, but not Jess than all, of
the Preferred Stock then outstanding in three (3) equal annual installments (each installment or
payment date, a “Redemption Date”). The Corporation shall, on each Redemption Date, redeem up
to the maximum amount the Corporation may lawfully redeem out of funds legally available
therefor. The “Redemption Price” shall mean (i) with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock, an
amount per share equal to the Series A Original Issue Price, plus an additional amount equal to any
dividends declared but unpaid on each such share, (ii) with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock,
an amount per share equal to the Series B Original Issue Price, plus an additional amount equal to
any dividends declared but unpaid on each such share, and (iii) with respect to the Series C Preferred
Stock, an amount per share equal to the Series C Origina! Issue Price, plus an additional amount

fifteen (15) days of the receipt by the Corporation of the Redemption Request, the Corporation shall
mail, first class postage prepaid, written notice (the “Notice of Redemption”) to each holder of
record (at the close of business on the business day preceding the day on which notice is given) of
Preferred Stock, at the address last shown on the records of the Corporation for such holder, for the
purpose of notifying such holder of the redemption to be effected. The Notice of Redemption shall
specify the Redemption Date which shall be between fifteen (15) and thirty (30) days after the
mailing of the Notice of Redemption on which the Preferred Stock then outstanding shall be
redeemed and the place at which payment shall be made, which shall be the principal offices of the
Corporation or such other place as shal] be mutually agreeable to the Corporation and holders of a
majority of the shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding, voting together as a single class. The
Notice of Redemption shall call upon each holder of Preferred Stock to either (i) surrender to the
Corporation, in the manner and at the place designated, such holder’s certificate or certificates

3953063_5.DOC -12-
representing the shares to be redeemed or (ii) convert such Preferred Stock into Common Stock prior

respect to such shares, and such shares shall not thereafter be transferred on the books of the
Corporation or be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose whatsoever. If the funds of the
Corporation legally available for redemption on any Redemption Date are insufficient to redeem the
total number of shares requested to be redeemed on such date, those funds which are legally
available will be used to redeem the maximum possible number of such shares ratably among the
holders of such shares to be redeemed based upon their holdings of Preferred Stock. The shares not
redeemed shall remain outstanding and be entitled to all the rights and preferences provided herein.

redemption of shares not redeemed, such funds will immediately be set aside for the redemption of
the balance of the shares which the Corporation has become obligated to redeem on any Redemption
Date but which it has not redeemed.

shall deposit the Redemption Price of all shares of Preferred Stock designated for redemption in the
Redemption Notice, and not yet redeemed or converted, with a bank or trust company having
aggregate capital and surplus in excess of $100,000,000 as a trust fund for the benefit of the
respective holders of the shares designated for redemption and not yet redeemed. Simultaneously,
the Corporation shall deposit irrevocable instructions and authority to such bank or trust company to
pay, on and after the date fixed for redemption or prior thereto, the Redemption Price of the
Preferred Stock to the holders thereof, upon receipt of notification from the Corporation that such
holder has surrendered such holder’s certificates pursuant to subsection (B) above. Any money
deposited by the Corporation pursuant to this subsection (D) for the redemption of shares which are
thereafter converted into shares of Common Stock no later than the close of business on the last
business day prior to the Redemption Date shall be returned to the Corporation forthwith upon such
conversion, The balance of any money deposited by the Corporation pursuant to this subsection (D)
rernaining unclaimed at the expiration of six months following the Redemption Date shall thereafter
