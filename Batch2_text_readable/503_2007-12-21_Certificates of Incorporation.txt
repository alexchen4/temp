Article ITV

A. Authorized Number of Shares. The Corporation is authorized to issue two
classes of stock to be designated, respectively, “Common Stock” and “Preferred Stock.” The
total number of shares which the Corporation is authorized to issue is 56,700,000 shares, of
which 30,000,000 shares shall be Common Stock, each having a par value of $0.0001 per share,
and 26,700,000 shares shall be Preferred Stock, each having a par value of $0.0001 per share.

B. Board Power to Designate. The shares of Preferred Stock may be issued
from time to time in one or more series. Subject to compliance with applicable protective voting
rights which have been or may be granted to the Preferred Stock or series thereof in Certificates
of Designation or this Corporation’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the
“Protective Provisions”), the Board of Directors is hereby vested with authority to fix by
resolution or resolutions the designations and the powers, preferences and relative, participating,
optional] or other special rights, and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, including
without limitation the dividend rate, conversion or exchange rights, redemption price and
liquidation preference, of any series of shares of Preferred Stock, and to fix the number of shares
constituting any such series, and, subject to applicable Protective Provisions, to increase or
decrease the number of shares of any such series (but not below the number of shares thereof
then outstanding). In case the number of shares of any such series shal] be so decreased, the
shares constituting such decrease shall resume the status which they had prior to the adoption of
the resolution or resolutions originally fixing the number of shares of such series.

C. Designation. The Preferred Stock shall be divided into series. The first
series shal] consist of 7,089,785 shares and is designated “Series A Convertible Preferred Stock”
(the “Series A Preferred’’). The second series shall consist of 8,610,000 shares and is designated
“Series B Convertible Preferred Stock” (the ‘Series B Preferred”). The third series shall consist
of 11,000,000 shares and is designated “Series C Convertible Preferred Stock” (the “Series C
Preferred”). The rights, preferences, privileges, restrictions and other matters relating to the
Series A Preferred, the Series B Preferred and the Series C Preferred (collectively, the ‘Series
Preferred”) are as follows:

1. Dividend Rights. Subject to provisions of law, the holders of record of
shares of the Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred and the Series C Preferred shall be entitled
to receive cash dividends, on a pari passu basis, which shall be payable when, as and if declared
by the Board of Directors, out of assets which are legally available for the payment of such
dividends, including any special dividends declared by the Board of Directors as well as ordinary
dividends, at an annual rate equal to $0.1088 per share of Series A Preferred, $0.1360 per share
of Series B Preferred, and $0.1600 per share of Series C Preferred (which amounts shall be
subject to equitable adjustment whenever there shall occur a stock dividend, stock split,
combination, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other similar event)
(collectively, “Recapitalizations”), provided that such dividends shall not be currently payable
and shall only be payable when and if specifically provided herein. Dividends shall be
cumulative, without compounding, and shall accrue daily on each share of Series A Preferred,
Series B Preferred and Series C Preferred from the respective dates of issue thereof. Dividends

540296.4 2

556629 v6/SD
payable on the Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred and Series C Preferred for any period less
than a full year shall be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed and a 365-
day year. No dividends shall be paid or declared, and no other distribution shall be made, on or
with respect to the Common Stock of the Corporation as long as there are shares of Series A
Preferred, Series B Preferred or Series C Preferred issued and outstanding. Upon the conversion
of shares of the Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred or Series C Preferred into Common Stock
of the Corporation, all cumulative dividends with respect to such converted shares shall be
cancelled. Any partial payment shall be made ratably among the holders of Series A Preferred,
Series B Preferred and Series C Preferred in proportion to the payment each such holder would
receive if the full amount of such dividends were paid.

2. Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up.

(a) Treatment at Sale, Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up. In
the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or
involuntary, before any distribution or payment is made to any holders of any shares of Common
Stock, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred and Series C Preferred, pari
passu, shall be entitled to be paid first out of the assets of the Corporation available for distribution
to holders of the Corporation’s capital stock whether such assets are capital, surplus or earnings, an
amount equal to $1.36 per share of Series A Preferred, $1.70 per share of Series B Preferred and
$2.00 per share of Series C Preferred (as adjusted for any Recapitalizations) plus any dividends
accrued or declared but unpaid on such shares, as adjusted for any Recapitalizations (such amounts,
as sO determined, are referred to herein as the ‘Series A Liquidation Value”, “Series B Liquidation
Value” and “Series C Liquidation Value”, respectively, with respect to such shares). After payment
has been made to the holders of the Series Preferred of the full liquidation preference to which such
holders shall be entitled as aforesaid, the remaining assets, if any, shall be distributed among the
holders of Series Preferred and Common Stock on a pro-rata basis, with such distribution to the
holders of Series Preferred as would have been payable had each such share been converted to
Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of Section 5 hereof immediately prior to such event of
liquidation, dissolution or winding up.

(b) Insufficient Funds. If upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding
up, the assets or surplus funds of the Corporation to be distributed to the holders of shares of Series
Preferred and any other then-outstanding shares of the Corporation's capital stock ranking on a
parity with respect to payment on liquidation with the Series Preferred (such shares being referred
to herein as the “Series Preferred Parity Stock”) shall be insufficient to permit payment to such
respective holders of the full Series A Liquidation Value, Series B Liquidation Value and Series C
Preferred and al] other preferential amounts payable with respect to the Series Preferred and such
Series Preferred Parity Stock, then the assets available for payment or distribution to such holders
shall be allocated among the holders of the Series Preferred and such Series Preferred Parity Stock,
pro rata, in proportion to the full respective preferential amounts to which the Series Preferred and
such Series Preferred Parity Stock are each entitled.

(c) Certain Transactions Treated as Liquidation. For purposes of this
Section 2, (i) any acquisition of the Corporation by means of merger or other form of corporate
reorganization or consolidation with or into another corporation in which outstanding shares of this
Corporation, including shares of Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred, or Series C Preferred are

556629 v6/SD 3
exchanged for securities or other consideration issued, or caused to be issued, by the other
corporation or its subsidiary (including any sale pursuant to Section 2.2 of the Amended and
Restated Stockholders’ Agreement to be entered into among the Corporation and certain of its
stockholders on or about the date on which the Corporation first sells shares of Series C Preferred
(the ‘‘Stockholders’ Agreement’’)) and, as a result of which transaction, the stockholders of this
Corporation own 50% or less of the voting power of the surviving entity (other than a mere re-
incorporation transaction), (ii) a sale, transfer or lease (other than a pledge or grant of a security
interest to a bona fide lender) of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation (other than
to or by a wholly-owned subsidiary or parent of the Corporation), or (iil) the grant of an exclusive
license to all or substantially all of the Corporation’s intellectual property, shall be treated as a
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation and shall entitle the holders of Series
Preferred to receive the amount that would be received in a liquidation, dissolution or winding up
pursuant to Section 2(a) hereof, if the holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding shares of
Series A Preferred (as to the Series A entitlement), the holders of at least 50% of the then
outstanding shares of Series B Preferred (as to the Series B entitlement) and the holders of at least
50% of the then outstanding shares of Series C Preferred (as to the Series C entitlement) so elect by
giving written notice thereof to the Corporation at least three days before the effective date of such
event, or have voted in favor of such event at a stockholders meeting (or pursuant to a written
consent in lieu of a meeting).

(d) Distributions of Property. Whenever the distribution provided for
in this Section 2 shall be payable in property other than cash, the value of such distribution shall be
the fair market value of such property as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, unless
the holders of 50% or more of the then outstanding shares of Series Preferred request, in writing,
that an independent appraiser perform such valuation, then by an independent appraiser selected by
the Board of Directors and reasonably acceptable to 50% or more of the holders of Series Preferred.
Any securities shall be valued as follows:

(i) The value of securities not subject to investment letter or
other similar restrictions on free marketability) other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of a
stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) sha]! be:

(A) if traded on a securities exchange or through the
Nasdaq National Market, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the
securities on such exchange or system over the 30-day period (or portion thereof) ending three
days prior to the closing;

(B) if actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall
be deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the
30-day period (or portion thereof) ending three days prior to the closing; and

(C) if there is no active public market, the value shall be
the fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Board of Directors of this
Corporation including the members thereof elected by the holders of the Series Preferred Stock
pursuant to Section IV(B){5)(b) and the holders of a majority of the voting power of al] then
outstanding shares of Series Preferred.

556629 v6/SD 4
(D) The method of valuation of securities subject to
investment letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely
by virtue of a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an
appropriate discount from the value determined as above in Section IV(C)(2)(d)(i)(A) to reflect
the approximate fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Board of Directors of
this Corporation and the holders of a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares
of the Series Preferred.

(E) In the event the requirements of this Section
TV(C)(2)(d) are not complied with, this Corporation shall forthwith either:

(i) cause such closing to be postponed until
such time as the requirements of this Section IV(C)(2)(d) have been
complied with; or

(ii) cancel such transaction, in which event the
rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of the Series Preferred
shall revert to and be the same as such rights, preferences and privileges
existing immediately prior to the date of the first notice referred to in
Section IV(C)(2)(F) hereof.

(F) | This Corporation shall give each holder of record of
Series Preferred written notice of an impending transaction set forth in Section IV(C)(2)(c)
above not later than 20 days prior to the stockholders’ meeting called to approve such
transaction, or 20 days prior to the closing of such transaction, whichever is earlier, and shall
also notify such holders in writing of the final approval of such transaction. The first of such -
notices shall describe the material terms and conditions of the impending transaction and the
provisions of this Section IV(c)(2), and this Corporation shall thereafter give such holders
prompt notice of any material changes. The transaction shall in no event take place sooner than
20 days after this Corporation has given the first notice provided for herein or sooner than 10
days after this Corporation has given notice of any material changes provided for herein;
provided, however, that such periods may be shortened upon the written consent of the holders
of Series Preferred that are entitled to such notice rights or similar notice rights and that represent
at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of such Series Preferred.

3. Voting Power.

(a) General. Except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 8 hereof
or as otherwise required by law, each holder of Series Preferred shall be entitled to vote on all
matters and shall be entitled to that number of votes equal to the number of whole shares of
Common Stock into which such holder’s shares of Series Preferred could then be converted,
pursuant to the provisions of Section 4 hereof, at the record date for the determination of
stockholders entitled to vote on such matter or, if no such record date is established, at the date such
vote is taken or any written consent of stockholders is solicited. Except as otherwise expressly
provided in Section 8 hereof or as otherwise required by law, the holders of shares of Series
Preferred and Common Stock shall vote together as a single class on all matters.

556629 v6/SD 5
4. Conversion Rights. The holders of the Series Preferred shall have the
following rights with respect to the conversion of such shares into shares of Common Stock:

(a) General. Subject to and in compliance with the provisions of this
Section 4, any or all shares of the Series Preferred may, at the option of the holder thereof, be
converted at any time into fully-paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock, except that the
Corporation shall not be required to convert less than 25,000 shares of Series Preferred in the event
such holder seeks to convert less than all of such holder's shares of Series Preferred as applicable.
The number of shares of Common Stock that a holder of Series Preferred shal] be entitled to receive
upon conversion shall be the product obtained by multiplying the Series A Applicable Conversion
Rate, Series B Applicable Conversion Rate, or Series C Applicable Conversion Rate, as applicable
(determined as provided in Section 4(b)) by the number of shares of Series A Preferred, Series B
Preferred or Series C Preferred, as applicable, being converted at any time.

(b) Applicable Conversion Rate. The conversion rate in effect at any
time for the Series A Preferred (the “Series A Applicable Conversion Rate’’) shall be the quotient
obtained by dividing $1.36 by the Series A Applicable Conversion Value, as defined in Section
4(c). Initially, the Series A Applicable Conversion Rate shall be one (1), and each share of Series A
Preferred shall initially be convertible into one (1) share of Common Stock. The conversion rate in
effect at any time for the Series B Preferred (the “Series B Applicable Conversion Rate’’) shall be
the quotient obtained by dividing $1.70 by the Series B Applicable Conversion Value, as defined in
Section 4(c). Initially, the Series B Applicable Conversion Rate shall be one (1), and each share of
Series B Preferred shall initially be convertible into one (1) share of Common Stock. The
conversion rate in effect at any time for the Series C Preferred (the “Series C -Applicable
Conversion Rate”) shall be the quotient obtained by dividing $2.00 by the Series C-Applicable
Conversion Value, as defined in Section 4(c). Initially, the Series C Applicable Conversion Rate
shall be one (1), and each share of Series C Preferred shall initially be convertible into one (1) share
of Common Stock.

(c) Applicable Conversion Value. The Series A Applicable Conversion
Value in effect from time to time, except as adjusted in accordance with Section 4(d) hereof, shall
be $1.36 with respect to the Series A Preferred (the ‘Series A Applicable Conversion Value”). The
Series B Applicable Conversion Value in effect from time to time, except as adjusted in accordance
with Section 4(d) hereof, shall be $1.70 with respect to the Series B Preferred (the “Series B
Applicable Conversion Value”). The Series C Applicable Conversion Value in effect from time to
time, except as adjusted in accordance with Section 4(d) hereof, shall be $2.00 with respect to the
Series C Preferred (the “Series C Applicable Conversion Value”).

(d) Adjustment to Series A Applicable Conversion Value, Series B
Applicable Conversion Value and Series C Applicable Conversion Value.

(i) Effect on Series A Applicable Conversion Value, Series
B Applicable Conversion Value and Series C Applicable Conversion Value.

(A) Dilutive Issuances of Common Stock or

Convertible Securities. If the Corporation shall, while there are any shares of Series A
Preferred, Series B Preferred or Series C Preferred outstanding, issue or sell shares of its

§56629 v6/SD 6
Common Stock (or Common Stock Equivalents, as defined below) without consideration or at a
price per share less than the Series A Applicable Conversion Value, Series B Applicable
Conversion Value or Series C Applicable Conversion Value in effect immediately prior to such
issuance or Sale, then and in such event, solely with respect to the applicable series, such Series
A Applicable Conversion Value, Series B Applicable Conversion Value, or Series C Applicable
Conversion Value, as applicable, upon each such issuance or sale, except as hereinafter provided,
shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest cent)
determined by multiplying the Series A Applicable Conversion Value, Series B Applicable
Conversion Value or Series C Applicable Conversion Value, as applicable, in effect immediately
prior to such calculation by a fraction:

(i) the numerator of which shal] be (a) the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of such
additional shares of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents (calculated on a fully diluted
basis assuming the exercise or conversion of all then exercisable options, warrants, purchase
rights or convertible securities), plus (b) the number of shares of Common Stock which the net
aggregate consideration, if any, received by the Corporation for the total number of such
additional shares of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents so issued would purchase at
the Series A Applicable Conversion Value, Series B Applicable Conversion Value, or Series C
Applicable Conversion Value, as applicable, in effect immediately prior to such issuance, and

(2) the denominator of which shall be (a) the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of such
additional shares of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents (calculated on a fully diluted
basis assuming the exercise or conversion of al! then exercisable options, warrants, purchase
rights or convertible securities), plus (b) the number of such. additional shares of Common Stock
or Common Stock Equivalents so issued.

The provisions of this Section 4(d)(i)(A) may be waived as to the Series A Preferred in any
instance (without the necessity of convening any meeting of stockholders of the Corporation)
upon the written consent of the holders of at least 667/3% of the outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred. The provisions of this Section 4(d)(i)(A) may be waived as to the Series B Preferred
in any instance (without the necessity of convening any meeting of stockholders of the
Corporation) upon the written consent of the holders of at least 66 */3% of the outstanding shares
of Series B Preferred. The provisions of this Section 4(d)(i)(A) may be waived as to the Series C
Preferred in any instance (without the necessity of convening any meeting of stockholders of the
Corporation) upon the written consent of the holders of at least 667/3% of the outstanding shares
of Series C Preferred.

(B) Other Dilutive Issuances of Warrants, Options
and Purchase Rights to Common Stock or Convertible Securities.

(1) For the purposes of this Section 4(d){i), the
issuance of any warrants, options, subscription or purchase rights with respect to shares of
Common Stock and the issuance of any securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of
Common Stock (other than the issuance of shares of Series Preferred), or the issuance of any
warrants, options, subscription or purchase rights with respect to such convertible or

$56629 v6/SD 7
exchangeable securities (collectively, “Common Stock Equivalents”), shall be deemed an
issuance of Common Stock with respect to the Series Preferred if the Net Consideration Per
Share (as hereinafter determined) which may be received by the Corporation for such Common
Stock Equivalents shall be less than the Series A Applicable Conversion Value, Series B
Applicable Conversion Value, or Series C Applicable Conversion Value, as applicable, in effect
at the time of such issuance. Any obligation, agreement or undertaking to issue Common Stock
Equivalents at any time in the future shall be deemed to be an issuance at the time such
obligation, agreement or undertaking is made or arises. No adjustment of the Series A
Applicable Conversion Value, Series B Applicable Conversion Value, or Series C Applicable
Conversion Value, as applicable, shall be made under this Section 4(d)(i) upon the issuance of
any shares of Common Stock which are issued pursuant to the exercise, conversion or exchange
of any Common Stock Equivalents if any adjustment shall previously have been made upon the
issuance of any such Common Stock Equivalents as above provided.

(2) Should the Net Consideration Per Share of
any such Common Stock Equivalents be decreased from time to time, then, upon the
effectiveness of each such change, the Series A Applicable Conversion Value, Series B
Applicable Conversion Value, or Series C Applicable Conversion Value, as applicable, will be
that which would have been obtained (a) had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such
Common Stock Equivalents been made upon the basis of the actual Net Consideration Per Share
of such securities, and (b) had adjustments made to the Series A Applicable Conversion Value,
Series B Applicable Conversion Value, or Series C Applicable Conversion Value, as applicable,
since the date of issuance of such Common Stock Equivalents been made to such Series A
Applicable Conversion Value, Series B Applicable Conversion Value, or Series C Applicable
Conversion Value as applicable, as adjusted pursuant to Section 4(d)(i)(B)(1) above. Any
adjustment of the Series A Applicable Conversion Value, the Series B Applicable Conversion
Value, or the Series C Applicable Conversion Value, as applicable, with respect to this paragraph
which relates to Common Stock Equivalents shall be disregarded if, as, and when all of such
Common Stock Equivalents expire or are cancelled without being exercised, so that the Series A
Applicable Conversion Value, the Series B Applicable Conversion Value, or the Series C
Applicable Conversion Value, as applicable, effective immediately upon such cancellation or
expiration shall be equal! to the Series A Applicable Conversion Value, the Series B Applicable
Conversion Value, or the Series C Applicable Conversion Value, as applicable, in effect at the
time of the issuance of the expired or cancelled Common Stock Equivalents, with such additional
adjustments as would have been made to the Series A Applicable Conversion Value, the Series B
Applicable Conversion Value, or the Series C.Applicable Conversion Value, as applicable, had
the expired or cancelled Common Stock Equivalents not been issued.

(3) For purposes of this Section 4(d), the “Net
Consideration Per Share” which may be received by the Corporation shall be determined as
follows:

(a) The “Net Consideration Per Share”
shall mean the amount equal to the total amount of consideration, if any, received by the
Corporation for the issuance of such Common Stock Equivalents, plus the minimum amount of
consideration, if any, payable to the Corporation upon exercise, or conversion or exchange

556629 v6/SD 8
thereof, divided by the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that would be issued if all
such Common Stock Equivalents were exercised, exchanged or converted.

(b) The “Net Consideration Per Share”
which may be received by the Corporation shall be determined in each instance as of the date of
issuance of Common Stock Equivalents without giving effect to any possible future upward price
adjustments or rate adjustments which may be applicable with respect to such Common Stock
Equivalents; provided, however, that in the event that any Common Stock Equivalents are issued
under which the applicable exercise or conversion price will be established in the future, then the
Net Consideration Per Share shall be calculated, and corresponding adjustments under this
Section 4(d) shall be effected, when such exercise or conversion price is first established.

(C) Stock Dividends for Holders of Capital Stock
Other Than Common Stock. In the event that the Corporation shall make or issue, or shall fix
a record date for the determination of holders of any capital stock of the Corporation other than
holders of Common Stock entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in Common
Stock or securities of the Corporation convertible into or otherwise exchangeable for the
Common Stock of the Corporation, then such Common Stock or other securities issued in
payment of such dividend shall be deemed to have been issued for a consideration of $.01,
except for (1) dividends payable in shares of Common Stock payable pro rata to holders of Series
A Preferred, Series B Preferred, or the Series C Preferred and to holders of any other class of
stock (whether or not paid to holders of any other class of stock), or (2) with respect to the Series
A Preferred, dividends payable in shares of Series A Preferred, (3) with respect to the Series B
Preferred, dividends payable in shares of Series B Preferred, or (4) with respect to the Series C
Preferred, dividends payable in shares of Series C Preferred.

(D) Consideration Other than Cash. For purposes of
this Section 4(d)(i), if a part or all of the consideration received by the Corporation in connection
with the issuance of shares of Common Stock or the issuance of any of the securities described in
this Section 4(d)(i) consists of property other than cash, such consideration shall be deemed to
have a fair market value as is reasonably determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of
the Corporation.

(E) Exceptions to Anti-dilution. This Section 4(d)(i)
shall not apply under any of the circumstances which would constitute an Extraordinary
Common Stock Event (as described below). Further, this Section 4(d)(i) shall not apply with
respect to:

(1) the issuance of up to an aggregate of
1,349,267 shares (exclusive of the shares issuable pursuant to the options referenced in
Section 4(d)(i)(E)(2)) of Common Stock (or options to purchase such shares of Common Stock),
issuable to employees, officers or directors of the Corporation at prices or exercise prices
determined by the Board of Directors to be not less than fair market value and issued pursuant to
a stock option plan or restricted stock purchase plan approved by the stockholders and the Board
of Directors;

556629 v6/SD 9
(2) the issuance of shares subject to outstanding
options granted pursuant to that certain Stock Option Agreement entered into between the
Corporation and the Founders named therein on or about the date on which the Corporation first
sold shares of Series A Preferred;

(3) the issuance of shares of Common Stock
upon the conversion of any shares of Series Preferred;

(4) the issuance of securities in connection with
equipment or debt financing or leases (including securities issued in consideration of guarantees
of such financing or leases) provided such issuance and the terms of such issuance have been
approved by the Corporation's Board of Directors; and

(5) the issuance of securities to acquisition
targets, vendors, landlords, customers, consultants, advisors, or co-venturers or to other persons
in similar commercial or corporate partnering situations with the Corporation provided such
issuance and the terms of such issuance have been approved by the Corporation’s Board of
Directors.

(ii) Upon Extraordinary Common Stock Event. Upon the
happening of an Extraordinary Common Stock Event (as hereinafter defined), the Series A
Applicable Conversion Value (and all other conversion values set forth in Section 4(d)(i) above).
shall, simultaneously with the happening of such Extraordinary Common Stock Event, be
adjusted by multiplying the Series A Applicable Conversion Value by a fraction, the numerator.
of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such
Extraordinary Common Stock Event and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares
of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such Extraordinary Common Stock Event, and
the product so obtained shall thereafter be the Series A Applicable Conversion Value. The
Series A Applicable Conversion Value, as so adjusted, shal] be readjusted in the same manner
upon the happening of any successive Extraordinary Common Stock Event or Events. Upon the
happening of an Extraordinary Common Stock Event, the Series B Applicable Conversion Value
(and all other conversion values set forth in Section 4(d)(i) above) shall, simultaneously with the
happening of such Extraordinary Common Stock Event, be adjusted by multiplying the Series B
Applicable Conversion Value by a fraction, the numerator of which shal] be the number of shares
of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Extraordinary Common Stock Event
and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately after such Extraordinary Common Stock Event, and the product so obtained shall
thereafter be the Series B Applicable Conversion Value. The Series B Applicable Conversion
Value, as so adjusted, shall be readjusted in the same manner upon the happening of any
successive Extraordinary Common Stock Event or Events. Upon the happening of an
Extraordinary Common Stock Event, the Series C Applicable Conversion Value (and all other
conversion values set forth in Section 4(d)(i) above) shall, simultaneously with the happening of
such Extraordinary Common Stock Event, be adjusted by multiplying the Series C Applicable
Conversion Value by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Extraordinary Common Stock Event and
the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately after such Extraordinary Common Stock Event, and the product so obtained shall

§56629 v6/SD 10
thereafter be the Series C Applicable Conversion Value. The Series C Applicable Conversion
Value, as so adjusted, shall be readjusted in the same manner upon the happening of any
successive Extraordinary Common Stock Event or Events. An “Extraordinary Common Stock
Event” shall mean (A) the issuance of additional shares of Common Stock as a dividend or other
distribution on outstanding shares of Common Stock, (B) a subdivision of outstanding shares of
Common Stock into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, or (C) a combination or
reverse stock split of outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares of
Common Stock.

(iii) Waiver of Adjustment to Series A, B or C Applicable
Conversion Value. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the operation of, and any
adjustment of the Series A Applicable Conversion Value, the Series B Applicable Conversion
Value, or the Series C Applicable Conversion Value pursuant to, this Section 4(d) may be
waived with respect to any specific share or shares of Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred or
Series C Preferred, either prospectively or retroactively and either generally or in a particular
instance, by a writing executed by the registered holder of such share or shares. Any waiver
pursuant to this Section 4(d)(iii) shall bind all future holders of shares of Series A Preferred,
Series B Preferred or Series C Preferred for which such rights have been waived. In the event
that a waiver of adjustment of Series A Applicable Conversion Value, Series B Applicable
Conversion Value or the Series C Applicable Conversion Value under this Section 4(d)(iii)
results in different Series A Applicable Conversion Value, Series B Applicable Conversion
Value, or Series C Applicable Conversion Value for shares of Series A Preferred, Series B
Preferred or Series C Preferred, the Secretary of the Corporation shall maintain a written ledger
identifying the Series A Applicable Conversion Value, Series B Applicable Conversion Value,
or the Series C Applicable Conversion Value for each share of Series A Preferred, Series B
Preferred or Series C Preferred. Such information shall be made available to any person upon
request. For the purposes of Section 4(d)(i), if different shares of Series A Preferred, Series B
Preferred or Series C Preferred have more than one Series A Applicable Conversion: Value,
Series B Applicable Conversion Value, or Series C Applicable Conversion Value as a result of a
waiver of adjustment of Series A Applicable Conversion Value, Series B Applicable Conversion
Value, or Series C Applicable Conversion under this Section 4(d)(iii), the Series A Applicable

Conversion Value for triggering any future adjustment of the Series A Applicable Conversion

such adjustment waived shall be the lowest Series A Applicable Conversion Value, Series B

(e) Automatic Conversion Upon Initial Public Offering.

(i) Mandatory Conversion of Preferred Stock. Immediately
upon the closing of an underwritten public offering on a firm commitment basis pursuant to an
effective registration statement filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
covering the offer and sale of Common Stock for the account of the Corporation in which the
Corporation actually receives gross proceeds equal to or greater than $25,000,000 (calculated
before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and before calculation of expenses) at

556629 v6/SD 1]
a price per share of not less than $7.50 (following appropriate adjustment in the event of any
stock dividends, stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization affecting such shares),
al] outstanding shares of Series Preferred shall be converted automatically into the number of
shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series Preferred are then convertible
pursuant to Section 4 hereof without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether
or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer
agent.

(ii) | Surrender of Certificates Upon Mandatory Conversion.
Upon the occurrence of the conversion events specified in the preceding paragraph (i), the
holders of the Series Preferred shall, upon notice from the Corporation, surrender the certificates
representing such shares at the office of the Corporation or of its transfer agent for the Common
Stock. Thereupon, there shall be issued and delivered to such holder a certificate or certificates
for the number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Series Preferred so
surrendered were convertible on the date on which such conversion occurred. The Corporation
shall not be obligated to issue such certificates unless certificates evidencing the shares of Series
Preferred being converted are either delivered to the Corporation or any such transfer agent, or
the holder notifies the Corporation that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and
executes an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any
loss incurred by it in connection therewith.

(f) Dividends. In the event the Corporation shal] make or issue, or shall
fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive a dividend or
other distribution (other than a distribution in liquidation or other distribution otherwise provided
for herein) with respect to the Common Stock payable in (i) securities of the Corporation other than
shares of Common Stock, or (ii) other assets (excluding cash dividends or distributions), then and in
each such event provision shall be made so that the holders of the Series Preferred shal] receive
upon conversion thereof in addition to the number of shares of Common Stock receivable
thereupon, the number of securities or such other assets of the Corporation which they would have
received had their Series Preferred been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event
and had they thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to and including the
Conversion Date (as that term is hereafter defined in Section 4(j)), retained such securities or such
other assets receivable by them during such period, giving application to all other adjustments
called for during such period under this Section 4 with respect to the rights of the holders of the
Series Preferred.

(g) Capital Reorganization or Reclassification. If the Common Stock
issuable upon the conversion of the Series Preferred shall be changed into the same or different
number of shares of any class or classes of capital stock, whether by capital reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares or
stock dividend provided for elsewhere in this Section 4, or a merger, consolidation or sale of all or
substantially all of the Corporation’s capital stock or assets to any other person), then and in each
such event the holder of each share of Series Preferred shall have the right thereafter to convert
such share into the kind and amount of shares of capital stock and other securities and property
receivable upon such reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other change by the holders
of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series Preferred might have

$56629 v6/SD 12
been converted immediately prior to such reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or
change, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein.

(h) Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets. If at any time or from
time to time there shall be a merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into another
corporation (other than a merger or reorganization involving only a change in the state of
incorporation of the Corporation), or the sale of all or substantially all of the Corporation’s capital
stock or assets to any other person, then, as a part of such reorganization, merger, or consolidation
or sale, provision shal] be made so that the holders of the Series Preferred shal] thereafter be
entitled to receive upon conversion of the Series Preferred the number of shares of stock or other
securities or property of the Corporation, or of the successor corporation resulting from such merger
or consolidation, to which such holder would have been entitled if such holder had converted its
shares of Series Preferred immediately prior to such capital reorganization, merger, consolidation or
sale. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of
this Section 4 to the end that the provisions of this Section 4 (including adjustment of the Series A
Applicable Conversion Value, Series B Applicable Conversion Value, or Series C Applicable
Conversion Value, as applicable, then in effect and the number of shares of Common Stock or other
securities issuable upon conversion of such shares of Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred, or
Series C Preferred, as applicable) shall be applicable after that event in as nearly equivalent a
manner as may be practicable.

(i) Certificate as to Adjustments; Notice by Corporation. In each
case of an adjustment or readjustment of the Series A Applicable Conversion Rate, the Series B
Applicable Conversion Rate, or the Series C Applicable Conversion Rate, the Corporation at its.
expense will furnish each holder of Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred, or Series C Preferred, as .
applicable, with a certificate prepared by the Treasurer or Chief Financial Officer of the
Corporation, showing such adjustment or readjustment, and stating in detai] the facts upon which
such adjustment or readjustment is based.

(j) Exercise of Conversion Privilege. To exercise its conversion
privilege, a holder of Series Preferred shall surrender the certificate or certificates representing the
shares being converted to the Corporation at its principal office, and shall give written notice to the
Corporation at that office that such holder elects to convert such shares. Such notice shail] also state
the name or names (with address or addresses) in which the certificate or certificates for shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be issued. The certificate or certificates for
shares of Series Preferred surrendered for conversion shall be accompanied by proper assignment
thereof to the Corporation or in blank. The date when such written notice is received by the
Corporation, together with the certificate or certificates representing the shares of Series Preferred
being converted, shall be the “Conversion Date.” As promptly as practicable after the Conversion
Date, the Corporation shall issue and shall deliver to the holder of the shares of Series Preferred
being converted, or on its written order, such certificate or certificates as it may request for the
number of whole shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of such shares of Series
Preferred in accordance with the provisions of this Section 4, rounded up to the nearest whole share
as provided in Section 4(k), in respect of any fraction of a share of Common Stock issuable upon
such conversion. Such conversion shal] be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the
close of business on the Conversion Date, and at such time the rights of the holder as holder of the
converted shares of Series Preferred shall cease and the person(s) in whose name(s) any

556629 v6/SD 13
certificate(s) for shares of Common Stock shall be issuable upon such conversion shall be deemed
to have become the holder or holders of record of the shares of Common Stock represented thereby.

(k) No Issuance of Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common
Stock or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of shares of Series
Preferred. Instead of any fractional shares of Common Stock which would otherwise be issuable
upon conversion of Series Preferred, the Corporation shall round up to the next whole share of
Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of shares of Series Preferred. The determination as to
whether any fractional shares of Common Stock shall be rounded up shall be made with respect to
the aggregate number of shares of Series Preferred being converted at any one time by any holder
thereof, not with respect to each share of Series Preferred being converted.

(I) Partial Conversion. In the event some but not all of the shares of
Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred or Series C Preferred, as applicable, represented by a
certificate(s) surrendered by a holder are converted, the Corporation shall execute and deliver to or
on the order of the holder, at the expense of the Corporation, a new certificate representing the
number of shares of Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred or Series C Preferred, as applicable,
which were not converted.

(m) Reservation of Common Stock. The Corporation shall at all times
reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock, solely for
the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Series Preferred, such number of its
shares of Common Stock as shal] from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all
outstanding shares of the Series Preferred (including any shares of Series Preferred represented by
any warrants, options, subscription or purchase rights for Series Preferred), and if at any time the
number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all then outstanding shares.of the Series Preferred (including any shares of Series
Preferred represented by any warrants, options, subscriptions or purchase rights for such Series
Preferred), the Corporation shall] take such action as may be necessary to increase its authorized but
unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.

(n) No Reissuance of Preferred Stock. No share or shares of Series A
Preferred, Series B Preferred, or Series C Preferred acquired by the Corporation by reason of
redemption, purchase, conversion or otherwise shall be reissued, and all such shares shall be
cancelled, retired and eliminated from the shares which the Corporation shall be authorized to issue.
The Corporation shall from time to time take such appropriate corporate action as may be necessary
to reduce the authorized number of shares of the Series A Preferred, the Series B Preferred, or the
Series C Preferred, as applicable.

redemption of the Series Preferred on the Redemption Date are insufficient to redeem the
number of shares of Series Preferred to be so redeemed on such Redemption Date, the holders of
shares of Series Preferred shall share ratably in any funds legally available for redemption of
such shares according to the respective amounts which would be payable with respect. to the
number of shares owned by them if the shares to be so redeemed on such Redemption Date were
redeemed in full. The shares of Series Preferred not redeemed shall remain outstanding and
entitled to all rights and preferences provided herein.

(ii) At any time thereafter when additional funds of the
Corporation are legally available for the redemption of such shares of Series Preferred, such
funds will be used, as soon as practicable but no later than the end of the next succeeding fiscal
quarter, to redeem the balance of such shares, or such portion thereof for which funds are then
legally available, on the basis set forth above.

(c) Redemption Proportionate. Each redemption of Series Preferred
pursuant to this Section 5 shall be made so that the number of shares of Series Preferred to be
redeemed from each registered owner shall be on a pro rata basis according to the manner of
distribution of the respective liquidation preferences of shares of Series Preferred which each such
holder of Series Preferred owns of record as of the applicable Redemption Date.

(d) Redemption Notice. At least 15 days prior to the Redemption Date,
written notice (hereinafter referred to as the “Redemption Notice”) shall be mailed, first class or
certified mail, postage prepaid, by the Corporation to each holder of record of Series Preferred
which are to be redeemed, as its address shown on the records of the Corporation; provided,

however, that the Corporation’s failure to give such Redemption Notice as to any holder shall not
affect its obligation to redeem the Preferred Stock as provided in this Section 5 hereof as to such
holder. The Redemption Notice shall contain the following information:

which are to be redeemed by the Corporation;

(ii) | the Redemption Date and the Redemption Price; and

surrendered certificate shall be canceled and retired. In the event some but not all of the Series
Preferred represented by a certificate(s) surrendered by a holder are being redeemed, the
Corporation shall execute and deliver to or on the order of the holder, at the expense of the
Corporation, a new certificate representing the number of shares of Series Preferred which were not
redeemed.

The rights of redemption of the holders of Series Preferred are subject to
the rights and preferences of any class or series of preferred stock that may be designated to be _
senior to, or on parity with, the Series Preferred with respect to rights of redemption.

(f) Dividends and Conversion after Redemption. From and after
payment in full of the Redemption Price with respect to a share of Series Preferred, such share of
Series Preferred subject to redemption shall not be entitled to any further dividends pursuant to
Section ] hereof or to the conversion provisions set forth in Section 4 hereof; provided, however,
that in all events such redemption is consummated.

office a register for the registration of shares of Series Preferred. Upon the surrender of any
certificate representing shares of Series Preferred at such place, the Corporation will, at the
request of the record holders of such certificate, execute and deliver (at the Corporation’s
expense) a new certificate or certificates in exchange therefore representing the aggregate
number of shares of Series Preferred represented by the surrendered certificate. Each such new
certificate will be registered in such name and will represent such number of shares of Series
Preferred as is required by the holder of the surrendered certificate and will be substantially
identical in form to the surrendered certificate.

Corporation (an affidavit of the registered holder will be satisfactory) of the ownership and the
loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of any certificate evidencing shares of Series Preferred, and

State of Delaware, the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to adopt, amend and repeal the
bylaws of the Corporation. .

Article VI

A. Elimination of Certain Liability of Directors. To the fullest extent permitted by
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, a director of the Corporation shall! not be
personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of
fiduciary duty as a director of the Corporation; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not
eliminate or limit the liability of a director (i) for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to
the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve
intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the Delaware

556629 v6/SD 20
General Corporation Law or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper

as so amended. No amendment to or repeal of this Article VII shall have any adverse effect on
the liability or alleged liability of any director of the Corporation for or with respect to any acts
or omissions of such director occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.

B. Indemnification and Insurance.

l. Right to Indemnification. Each person who was or is made a party or is
threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative, or investigative (hereinafter a “proceeding”), by reason of the fact that
he or she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer
of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer,
employee, or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, or other
enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such
proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee, or agent or in
any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee, or agent, shall be indemnified
and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in.the case of
any such amendment, to the fullest extent permitted by law, only to the extent that such
amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said. law
permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability, and
loss (including attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines, amounts paid or to be paid in settlement, and
excise taxes or penalties arising under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974)
reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith and such indemnification
shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee, or agent and
shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors, and administrators; provided, however,
that, except as provided in paragraph (2) below, the Corporation shall indemnify any such person
seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such
person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors. The
right to indemnification conferred in this Article VJJ(B) shal! be a contract right and shall include
the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding
in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that, if the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by a director or officer in his
or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is
rendered by such person while a director or officer, including, without limitation, service to an
employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding, shall be made only
upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such director or officer, to
repay al] amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such director or officer is
not entitled to be indemnified under this Article VII(B) or otherwise. The corporation may, by
action of the Board of Directors, provide indemnification to employees and agents of the
corporation with the same scope and effect as the foregoing indemnification of directors and
officers.

556629 v6/SD 21
2. Right of Claimant to Bring Suit. If a claim under paragraph (1) of this
Article VIJ(B) is not paid in full by the Corporation within 30 days after a written claim has been

received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the
Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the
claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a
defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred
in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if
any is required, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards
of conduct that make it permissible under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving
such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its
Board of Directors, independent legal counsel}, or its stockholders) to have made a determination
prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the
circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, nor an actual determination by the
Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that
the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or
create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

3. Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The right to indemnification and the payment
of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in
this Article V1I(B) shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or
hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of this Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaw,
agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

4. Insurance. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to
