EX-3.1

3. Liquidation Rights.
(a) Liquidation Preference. In the event of any Liquidation (as defined below), either voluntary or involuntary:

(i) the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any distribution of any of
the assets of the Corporation to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and Common Stock by reason of their ownership of such stock, an
amount per share for each share of Series B Preferred Stock held by them equal to the sum of (A) the Series B Liquidation Preference and (B) all
declared but unpaid dividends (if any) on such share of Series B Preferred Stock; and

(ii) thereafter, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any distribution
of any of the assets of the Corporation to the holders of the Common Stock by reason of their ownership of such stock, an amount per share for
each share of Series A Preferred Stock held by them equal to the sum of (A) the Series A Liquidation Preference and (B) all declared but unpaid
dividends (if any) on such share of Series A Preferred Stock;

provided, that, if upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the assets of the Corporation legally available for
distribution to the holders of the Preferred Stock are insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full amounts specified in this
Section 3(a), then the entire assets of the Corporation legally available for distribution shall be first distributed with equal priority and pro rata
among the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock in proportion to the full amounts they would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to this
Section 3(a) and, thereafter, to the extent any assets of the Corporation legally available for distribution remain after such distribution to the Series
B Preferred Stock, such remaining assets shall be distributed with equal priority and pro rata among the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock in
proportion to the full amounts they would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 3(a).

(b) Remaining Assets. After the payment or setting aside for payment to the holders of Preferred Stock of the full amounts specified in
Section 3(a) above, the entire remaining assets of the Corporation legally available for distribution shall be distributed pro rata to holders of the
Common Stock of the Corporation in proportion to the number of shares of Common Stock held by them.

4

(c) Shares not Treated as Both Preferred Stock and Common Stock in any Distribution. Shares of Preferred Stock shall not be entitled
to be converted into shares of Common Stock in order to participate in any distribution, or series of distributions, as shares of Common Stock,
without first foregoing participation in the distribution, or series of distributions, as shares of Preferred Stock.

(d) Liquidation: Deemed Liquidation. For purposes of this Section 3, a “Liquidation” shall be deemed to be occasioned by, or to
include: (i) a merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into any other entity or entities (but excluding any merger effected solely for the
purpose of reincorporating into another state) or the merger of any other entity or entities into the Corporation, in which the holders of the
Corporation’s voting power immediately prior to such merger or consolidation, hold (together with their affiliates), immediately after such merger
or consolidation, less than a majority of the voting power of the Corporation or the surviving or successor entity in such merger or consolidation (or
its parent); (ii) a sale, lease or other conveyance of, including the grant of an exclusive license with respect to, all or substantially all of the assets of
the Corporation; (iii) any sale, transfer, or issuance or series of sales, transfers, and/or issuances of shares of the Corporation’s capital stock by the
Corporation or the holders thereof as a result of which the holders of the Corporation’s outstanding voting stock immediately prior to such sale or
issuance own less than 50% of the Corporation’s outstanding voting stock immediately after such sale or issuance; (iv) an exclusive, irrevocable
licensing of all or substantially all of the Corporation’s intellectual property to a third party; or (v) any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the treatment of a transaction as a Liquidation pursuant to this
Section 3(d) may be waived, either prospectively or retrospectively and either generally or in a particular instance, by the consent or vote of the
holders of two-thirds of the outstanding Preferred Stock.

(e) Valuation of Non-Cash Consideration. If any assets of the Corporation distributed to stockholders in connection with any
liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation are other than cash, then the value of such assets shall be their fair market value as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, except that any publicly-traded securities to be distributed to stockholders in a liquidation,
dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation shall be valued as follows:

(i) If the securities are then traded on a national securities exchange, then the value of the securities shall be deemed to be the
average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange over the ten (10) trading day period ending five (5) trading days prior to the
distribution;

(ii) if the securities are actively traded over-the-counter, then the value of the securities shall be deemed to be the average of the
closing bid prices of the securities over the ten (10) trading day period ending five (5) trading days prior to the distribution.

In the event of a merger or other acquisition of the Corporation by another entity, the distribution date shall be deemed to be the date such
transaction closes.

4. Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as follows:

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after

http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1348334/0001 193125 13387339/d563790dex3 1.htm[10/15/2013 1:04:29 PM]
EX-3.1

the date of issuance of such share at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for the Series A Preferred Stock, into that number of fully-
paid, nonassessable shares of Common Stock determined by dividing the Series A Original Issue Price by the Series A Conversion Price. Each
share of Series B Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share at the
office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for the Series B Preferred Stock, into that number of fully-paid, nonassessable shares of Common
Stock determined by dividing the Series B Original Issue Price by the Series B Conversion Price. The rate at which each share of Preferred Stock
may be converted into share(s) of Common Stock is referred to herein as the “Conversion Rate” for such share of Preferred Stock. Upon any
decrease or increase in the Series A Conversion Price or Series B Conversion Price (as applicable) for any share of Preferred Stock, as described in
this Section 4, the Conversion Rate for such share of Preferred Stock shall be appropriately increased or decreased.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into fully-paid, non-assessable shares of
Common Stock at the then effective Conversion Rate for such share: (i) immediately prior to the closing of a firm commitment underwritten initial
public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act covering the offer and sale of the Corporation’s
Common Stock (a “Public Offering”); or (ii) upon the receipt by the Corporation of a written request for such conversion from the holders of at
least two-thirds of the Preferred Stock then outstanding, or, if later, the effective date for conversion specified in such requests (each of the events
referred to in (i) and (11) are referred to herein as an “Automatic Conversion Event’’).

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any
fractional shares to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the then fair
market value of a share of Common Stock as determined by the Board of Directors. For such purpose, all shares of Preferred Stock held by each
holder of Preferred Stock that are then being converted shall be aggregated, and any resulting fractional share of Common Stock shall be paid in
cash. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into full shares of Common Stock, and to receive certificates
therefor, he shall either: (i) surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent
for the Preferred Stock; or (ii) notify the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and execute an
agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates, and shall
give written notice to the Corporation at such office that he elects to convert the same; provided, however, that on the date of an Automatic
Conversion Event, the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically without any further action by the holders of such
shares and whether or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent; provided further,
however, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such Automatic
Conversion Event unless either the certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent as
provided above,

or the holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement
satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates. On the date of the
occurrence of an Automatic Conversion Event, each holder of record of shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, notwithstanding that the certificates representing such shares of Preferred Stock shall not have been
surrendered at the office of the Corporation, that notice from the Corporation shall not have been received by any holder of record of shares of
Preferred Stock, or that the certificates evidencing such shares of Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered to such holder.

The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after such delivery, or after such agreement and indemnification, issue and deliver at such office
to such holder of Preferred Stock, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which he shall be entitled as aforesaid
and a check payable to the holder in the amount of any cash amounts payable as the result of a conversion into fractional shares of Common Stock,
plus any declared and unpaid dividends on the converted Preferred Stock. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior
to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive
the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of
Common Stock on such date; provided, however, that if the conversion is in connection with an underwritten offer of securities registered pursuant
to the Securities Act or a merger, sale, financing, or liquidation of the Corporation or other event, the conversion may, at the option of any holder
tendering Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing of such transaction or upon the occurrence of such event, in which case
the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted
such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such transaction or the occurrence of such event.

(d) Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of Common Stock. In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be
subdivided (by stock split, by payment of a stock dividend or otherwise), into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Series A
Conversion Price and Series B Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such
subdivision, be proportionately decreased. In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined (by reclassification or
otherwise) into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, the Series A Conversion Price and Series B Conversion Price in effect immediately
prior to such combination shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination, be proportionately increased.

(e) Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of Series A Preferred Stock. In the event the outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred Stock shall be subdivided (by stock split, by payment of a stock dividend or otherwise), into a greater number of shares of Series A
Preferred Stock, the Series A Original Issue Price and Series A Liquidation Preference in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall,

http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1348334/0001 193125 13387339/d563790dex3 1.htm[10/15/2013 1:04:29 PM]
EX-3.1

concurrently with the effectiveness of such subdivision, be proportionately decreased. In the event the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred
Stock shall be combined (by reclassification or otherwise) into a lesser number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, the Series A Original Issue
Price and Series A Liquidation Preference in effect immediately prior to such combination shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such
combination, be proportionately increased.

(f) Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of Series B Preferred Stock. In the event the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred
Stock shall be subdivided (by stock split, by payment of a stock dividend or otherwise), into a greater number of shares of Series B Preferred
Stock, the Series B Original Issue Price and Series B Liquidation Preference in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall, concurrently with
the effectiveness of such subdivision, be proportionately decreased. In the event the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be
combined (by reclassification or otherwise) into a lesser number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock, the Series B Original Issue Price and Series
B Liquidation Preference in effect immediately prior to such combination shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination, be
proportionately increased.

(g) Adjustments for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. Subject to Section 3 above, if the Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock, whether by
capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares provided for above), then, in any such event,
in lieu of the number of shares of Common Stock which the holders would otherwise have been entitled to receive each holder of such Preferred
Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such shares of Preferred Stock into a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock which a
holder of the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock immediately before that change would have
been entitled to receive in such reorganization or reclassification, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein with respect to such other
shares.

(h) No Impairment. The Corporation will not, through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or
sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or
performed hereunder by the Corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in carrying out of all the provision of this Section 4 and in the
taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock against
impairment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 4(h) shall prohibit the Corporation from amending its Certificate of
Incorporation with the requisite consent of its stockholders and the Board of Directors, in accordance with applicable law and as provided herein.

(i) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of a Series A Conversion Price or Series B
Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation at its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance
with the terms hereof and furnish to each holder of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, as the case may be, a certificate setting
forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall,
upon the written request at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth:
(i) such adjustments and readjustments; (ii) the Series A Conversion Price or Series B Conversion Price, as the case may be, at the time in effect;
and (iii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon the conversion
of Preferred Stock.

(j) Notices of Record Date. In the event that this Corporation shall propose at any time:

(i) to declare any Distribution upon its Common Stock, whether in cash, property, stock or other securities, whether or not a
regular cash dividend and whether or not out of earnings or earned surplus;

(ii) to effect any reclassification or recapitalization of its Common Stock outstanding involving a change in the Common Stock;
or

(iii) to voluntarily liquidate or dissolve or to enter into any transaction deemed to be a Liquidation;

then, in connection with each such event, this Corporation shall send to the holders of the Preferred Stock at least (10) days’ prior written notice of
the date on which a record shall be taken for such Distribution (and specifying the date on which the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled
thereto and, if applicable, the amount and character of such Distribution) or for determining rights to vote in respect of the matters referred to in
(ii) and (iii) above.

Such written notice shall be given by first class mail (or express courier), postage prepaid, addressed to the holders of Preferred Stock at the
address for each such holder as shown on the books of the Corporation and shall be deemed given on the date such notice is mailed.

The notice provisions set forth in this section may be shortened or waived prospectively or retrospectively by the vote or written consent of
the holders of two-thirds of the Preferred Stock.

In the event the notice requirements of this section are not complied with or waived, the Corporation shall forthwith either cause the closing of
the transaction to be postponed until such requirements have been complied with, or cancel such transaction, in which event the rights, preferences

http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1348334/0001 193125 13387339/d563790dex3 1.htm[10/15/2013 1:04:29 PM]
EX-3.1

and privileges of the holders of the Preferred Stock shall revert to and be the same as such rights, preferences and privileges existing immediately
prior to the date of the first notice referred to in this subsection.

(k) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized
but unissued shares of Common Stock solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock, such number of its
shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and
if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding
shares of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.

5. Voting.

(a) Restricted Class Voting. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or required by law, the holders of Preferred Stock and the
holders of Common Stock shall vote together and not as separate classes.

(b) No Series Voting. Other than as provided herein or as required by law, there shall be no series voting.

(c) Preferred Stock. Each holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of shares of Common
Stock into which the shares of Preferred Stock held by such holder could be converted as of the record date. The holders of shares of the Preferred
Stock shall be entitled to vote on all matters on which the Common Stock shall be entitled to vote. Holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
notice of any stockholders’ meeting in accordance with the Bylaws of the Corporation. Fractional votes shall not, however, be permitted and any
fractional voting rights resulting from the above formula (after aggregating all shares into which shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder
could be converted), shall be disregarded.

(d) Composition of the Board of Directors: Voting. Directors shall be divided into two separate classes: “Class 1 Directors” and
“Class 2 Directors.” The Board of Directors shall initially consist of eight (8) members, each of whom shall be a Class 1 Director and have one
(1) vote per director on all matters to be considered by the Board of Directors. The number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall, at
the request of the holders of a majority of the Preferred Stock, be increased by one (1) and such director shall be a Class 2 Director and have four
(4) votes on all matters to be considered by the Board of Directors.

(e) Election of Directors. The Class | Directors shall be designated pursuant to a written consent of the Corporation’s stockholders as
follows: the holders of Common Stock, voting as a separate class, shall be entitled to designate four (4) Class 1 Directors; the holders of Series A
Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, shall be entitled to designate two (2) Class | Directors (the “Series A Directors’); and the holders of
Series B Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, shall be entitled to designate (2) Class | Directors (the “Series B Directors”). In the event the
number of directors constituting the Board is, at the request of the holders of a majority of the Preferred Stock, increased pursuant to Section 5(d),
the holders of a majority of the Preferred Stock, voting, on an as-converted basis as a single class, shall be entitled to designate one (1) Class 2
Director pursuant to a written consent of the holders of a majority of the Preferred Stock. Any vacancy created by the death, removal or resignation
of a director, shall be filled only by the holders of shares of such class or series having the right to elect such director and may be accomplished by:
(i) voting for their own designee to fill such vacancy at a meeting of the Corporation’s stockholders; or (ii) written consent, if the consenting
stockholders hold a number of shares that would be sufficient to elect their designee at a meeting of the stockholders. Any director may be
removed during his or her term of office with cause only upon the affirmative vote of the majority of the Directors; any director may be removed
during his or her term of office without cause only upon the affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of the class or series of stock entitled to
elect such director, given either at a special meeting of such stockholders duly called for that purpose or pursuant to a written consent of
stockholders, and any vacancy thereby created may be filled by the holders of that class or series of stock represented at the meeting or pursuant to
written consent.

10

(f) Quorum, Required Vote and Adjournment. Directors then in office holding a majority of the votes (or such greater number required
by applicable law) of all directors then in office shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. The vote of directors holding a majority
of votes present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the board of directors. If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting
of the Board of Directors, the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the
meeting, until a quorum shall be present.

(g) Adjustment in Authorized Common Stock. Subject to any separate class vote required by Article 7 hereof, the number of authorized
shares of Common Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding) by an affirmative
vote of the holders of Preferred Stock and the holders of Common Stock, voting together and not as separate classes, irrespective of the provisions
of Section 242(b)(2) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.

6. Redemption.

(a) At any time after the fifth (Sth) anniversary of the initial issuance of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock, and at the election of the
holders of at least two-thirds of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, this Corporation shall redeem, out of funds legally available

http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1348334/0001 193125 13387339/d563790dex3 1.htm[10/15/2013 1:04:29 PM]
EX-3.1

therefor, all or a portion (as determined by such holders of Preferred Stock) of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock which have not been
converted into Common Stock pursuant to Section 4 hereof. Within ninety (90) days after receipt of such redemption request (each, a
“Redemption Date”), the Corporation shall redeem each share of Preferred Stock by paying in cash an amount per share equal to the Redemption
Price applicable to such share.

(b) Any redemption effected pursuant to Section 6(a) shall be made on a pro rata basis among the holders of the Preferred Stock in
proportion to the shares of Preferred Stock then held by them.

(c) At least fifteen (15), but no more than thirty (30) days prior to each Redemption Date, written notice shall be mailed, first class
postage prepaid, to each holder of record (at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given) of the
Preferred Stock to be redeemed, at the address last shown on the records of the Corporation for such holder, notifying such holder of the
redemption to be effected, specifying the number of shares to be redeemed from such holder, the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price, the
place at which payment may be obtained and calling upon such holder to surrender to the Corporation, in the manner and at the place designated,
the holder’s certificate or certificates representing the shares to be redeemed (the “Redemption Notice’). Except as provided herein, on or after the
Redemption Date each holder of Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall surrender to this Corporation the certificate or certificates representing such
shares, in the manner and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice, and thereupon the Redemption Price of such shares shall be payable to
the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof and each surrendered certificate shall be
cancelled. In the event less than all the shares represented by any such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the
unredeemed shares.

(d) From and after the applicable Redemption Date, unless there shall have been a default in payment of the Redemption Price, all
rights of the holders of shares of Preferred

11

Stock designated for redemption in the Redemption Notice as holders of Preferred Stock (except the right to receive the Redemption Price without
interest upon surrender of their certificate or certificates) shall cease with respect to the shares designated for redemption on such date, and such
shares shall not thereafter be transferred on the books of the Corporation or be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose whatsoever. If the funds
of the Corporation legally available for redemption of shares of Preferred Stock on any Redemption Date are insufficient to redeem the total
number of shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such date, those funds which are legally available will first be used to redeem the maximum
possible number of such shares ratably among the holders of Series B Preferred Stock (if applicable) to be redeemed based upon their holdings of
Series B Preferred Stock and, thereafter, the maximum possible number of such shares ratably among the holders of Series A Preferred Stock (if
applicable) to be redeemed based upon their holdings of Series A Preferred Stock. The shares of Preferred Stock not redeemed shall remain
outstanding and entitled to all the rights and preferences provided herein. At any time thereafter when additional funds of the Corporation are
legally available for the redemption of shares of Preferred Stock such funds will immediately be used to redeem the balance of the shares which the
Corporation has become obliged to redeem on any Redemption Date, but which it has not redeemed.

(e) On or prior to each Redemption Date, the Corporation may deposit the Redemption Price of all shares of Preferred Stock designated
for redemption in the Redemption Notice and not yet redeemed with a bank or trust corporation having aggregate capital and surplus in excess of
$2,000,000,000, as a trust fund for the benefit of the respective holders of the shares designated for redemption and not yet redeemed, with
irrevocable instructions and authority to the bank or trust corporation to pay the Redemption Price for such shares to their respective holders on or
after the Redemption Date upon receipt of notification from the Corporation that such holder has surrendered a share certificate to the Corporation
pursuant to Section 6(e) above. As of the Redemption Date, the deposit shall constitute full payment of the shares to their holders, and from and
after the Redemption Date the shares so called for redemption shall be redeemed and shall be deemed to be no longer outstanding, and the holders
thereof shall cease to be stockholders with respect to such shares and shall have no rights with respect thereto except the right to receive from the
bank or trust corporation payment of the Redemption Price of the shares, without interest, upon surrender of their certificates therefor. Such
instructions shall also provide that any moneys deposited by the Corporation pursuant to this Section 6(e) for the redemption of shares thereafter
converted into shares of the Corporation’s Common Stock pursuant to Section 4 hereof prior to the Redemption Date shall be returned to the
Corporation forthwith upon such conversion. The balance of any moneys deposited by the Corporation pursuant to this Section 6(e) remaining
unclaimed at the expiration of two (2) years following the Redemption Date shall thereafter be returned to the Corporation upon its request
expressed in a resolution of its Board.
