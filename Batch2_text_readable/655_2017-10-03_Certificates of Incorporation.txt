(d) Reorganization. For purposes of this Section 3, a liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation shall be deemed to be occasioned by, or to include:

(i) the acquisition of the Corporation by another entity by means of any
transaction or series of related transactions to which the Corporation is party (including, without
limitation, any stock acquisition, reorganization, merger or consolidation but excluding any sale of
stock for capital raising purposes) other than a transaction or series of transactions in which the
holders of the voting securities of the Corporation outstanding immediately prior to such transaction
retain, immediately after such transaction or series of transactions, as a result of shares in the
Corporation held by such holders prior to such transaction, at least a majority of the total voting
power represented by the outstanding voting securities of the Corporation or such other surviving or
resulting entity (or if the Corporation or such other surviving or resulting entity is a wholly-owned
subsidiary immediately following such acquisition, its parent);

(ii) asale, lease or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets
of the Corporation and its subsidiaries taken as a whole by means of any transaction or series of
related transactions, except where such sale, lease or other disposition is to a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Corporation;

aif
(iii) upon the election of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
of Preferred Stock, voting together, a sale of all or substantially all of the Corporation’s assets or a
merger or consolidation of the Corporation with any other corporation; or

(iv) any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, whether
voluntary or involuntary.

(e) Valuation of Non-Cash Consideration. If any assets of the Corporation
distributed to stockholders in connection with any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the
Corporation are other than cash, then the value of such assets shall be their fair market value as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, except that any publicly-traded securities to be
distributed to stockholders in a liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation shall be
valued as follows:

(i) if the securities are then traded on a national securities exchange, then
the value of the securities shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on
such exchange over the ten (10) trading day period ending five (5) trading days prior to the
Distribution;

(ii) if the securities are actively traded over-the-counter, then the value of
the securities shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid prices of the securities over the ten
(10) trading day period ending five (5) trading days prior to the Distribution.

In the event of a merger or other acquisition of the Corporation by another entity, the
Distribution date shall be deemed to be the date such transaction closes.

For the purposes of this subsection 3(e), “trading day” shall mean any day which the
exchange or system on which the securities to be distributed are traded is open and “closing prices”
or “closing bid prices” shall be deemed to be: (i) for securities traded primarily on the New York
Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or a Nasdaq market, the last reported trade price or
sale price, as the case may be, at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on that day and (ii) for securities listed
or traded on other exchanges, markets and systems, the market price as of the end of the regular
hours trading period that is generally accepted as such for such exchange, market or system. If, after
the date hereof, the benchmark times generally accepted in the securities industry for determining
the market price of a stock as of a given trading day shall change from those set forth above, the fair
market value shall be determined as of such other generally accepted benchmark times.

4. Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shali have conversion rights as follows:

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the
option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share at the office of the
Corporation or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, into that number of fully-paid,
nonassessable shares of Common Stock determined by dividing the Original Issue Price for the
relevant series by the Conversion Price for such series. (The number of shares of Common Stock
into which each share of Preferred Stock of a series may be converted is hereinafter referred to as the
“Conversion Rate” for each such series.) Upon any decrease or increase in the Conversion Price for

cs
any series of Preferred Stock, as described in this Section 4, the Conversion Rate for such series
shall be appropriately increased or decreased.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be
converted into fully-paid, non-assessable shares of Common Stock at the then effective Conversion
Rate for such share (i) immediately prior to the closing of a firm commitment underwritten initial
public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the “Securities Act”), covering the offer and sale of the Corporation’s Common Stock,
provided that the offering price per share is not less than three (3) times the Original Purchase Price
(as adjusted for Recapitalizations) and that the aggregate gross proceeds to the Corporation are not
less than $20,000,000, or (ii) upon the receipt by the Corporation of a written request for such
conversion from the holders of a majority of the Preferred Stock then outstanding (voting as a single
class and on an as-converted basis), or, if later, the effective date for conversion specified in such
requests (each of the events referred to in (i) and (ii) are referred to herein as an “Automatic
Conversion Event’).

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be
issued upon conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would
otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the then
fair market value of a share of Common Stock as determined by the Board of Directors. For such
purpose, all shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder of Preferred Stock shall be aggregated,
and any resulting fractional share of Common Stock shall be paid in cash. Before any holder of
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into full shares of Common Stock, and to
receive certificates therefor, he shall either (A) surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly
endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock or
(B) notify the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or
destroyed and execute an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation
from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates, and shall give written notice to the
Corporation at such office that he elects to convert the same; provided, however, that on the date of
an Automatic Conversion Event, the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted
automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the
certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent;
provided further, however, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing
the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such Automatic Conversion Event unless either the
certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are delivered to the Corporation or its transfer
agent as provided above, or the holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such
certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the
Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such
certificates. On the date of the occurrence of an Automatic Conversion Event, each holder of record
of shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion, notwithstanding that the certificates representing such shares of
Preferred Stock shall not have been surrendered at the office of the Corporation, that notice from the
Corporation shall not have been received by any holder of record of shares of Preferred Stock, or
that the certificates evidencing such shares of Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered to
such holder.

(d) Adjustments to Conversion Price for Diluting Issues.

(i) Special Definition. For purposes of this paragraph 4(d), “Additional
Shares of Common” shall mean all shares of Common Stock issued (or, pursuant to paragraph
4(d)(iii), deemed to be issued) by the Corporation after the filing of this Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, other than issuances or deemed issuances of:

(1) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable to officers,
directors and employees of, or consultants to, the Corporation pursuant to stock grants, option plans,
purchase plans or other employee stock incentive programs or arrangements approved by the Board
of Directors, or upon exercise of options or warrants or other rights granted to such parties pursuant
to any such plan or arrangement;

(2) shares of Common Stock issued upon the exercise or
conversion of Options or Convertible Securities outstanding as of the date of the filing of this
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation;

(3) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable as a dividend or
distribution on Preferred Stock or pursuant to any event for which adjustment is made pursuant to
paragraph 4(e), 4(f) or 4(g) hereof;

(4) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable pursuant to the
acquisition of another corporation by the Corporation by merger, purchase of substantially all of the
assets or other reorganization or to a joint venture agreement, provided, that such issuances are
approved by the Board of Directors;

(5) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable in connection with
research, collaboration, technology license, development, OEM, marketing or other similar
agreements or strategic partnerships approved by the Board of Directors;

(6) shares issued upon conversion of the Preferred Stock;

(7) shares issued in connection with a registered public offering;
and

(8) shares that are otherwise excluded by consent of the holders of
a majority of the Preferred Stock.

(141i) No Adjustment of Conversion Price. No adjustment in the Conversion
Price of a particular series of Preferred Stock shall be made in respect of the issuance of Additional
Shares of Common unless the consideration per share (as determined pursuant to paragraph 4(d)(v))
for an Additional Share of Common issued or deemed to be issued by the Corporation is less than
the Conversion Price in effect on the date of, and immediately prior to such issue, for such series of
Preferred Stock.

(iii) Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall issue any Options or

os
Convertible Securities or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of
securities entitled to receive any such Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum number
of shares (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto without regard to any provisions contained
therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of
such Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities, the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities or, in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such
Options and the conversion or exchange of the underlying securities, shall be deemed to have been
issued as of the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close
of business on such record date, provided that in any such case in which shares are deemed to be
issued:

(1) no further adjustment in the Conversion Price of any series of
Preferred Stock shall be made upon the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities or shares of
Common Stock in connection with the exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities;

(2) if such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms provide,
with the passage of time or otherwise, for any change in the consideration payable to the Corporation
or in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange
thereof (other than pursuant to Recapitalization provisions of such Options or Convertible Securities
such as Sections 4(e), 4(f} and 4(g) hereof), the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock
and any subsequent adjustments based thereon shall be recomputed to reflect such change as if such
change had been in effect as of the original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of the record date
with respect thereto);

(3) no readjustment pursuant to clause (2) above shall have the effect
of increasing the Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock to an amount above the Conversion
Price that would have resulted from any other issuances of Additional Shares of Common and any
other adjustments provided for herein between the original adjustment date and such readjustment
date;

(4) upon the expiration of any such Options or any rights of
conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have been exercised, the
Conversion Price of each Series of Preferred Stock computed upon the original issue thereof (or
upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto) and any subsequent adjustments based
thereon shall, upon such expiration, be recomputed as if:

(a) in the case of Convertible Securities or Options for
Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common issued were the shares of Common Stock, if
any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities and the consideration received therefor was the consideration actually
received by the Corporation for the issue of such exercised Options plus the consideration actually
received by the Corporation upon such exercise or for the issue of all such Convertible Securities
which were actually converted or exchanged, plus the additional consideration, if any, actually
received by the Corporation upon such conversion or exchange, and

wife.
(b) in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, only the
Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were issued at the time of
issue of such Options, and the consideration received by the Corporation for the Additional Shares of
Common deemed to have been then issued was the consideration actually received by the
Corporation for the issue of such exercised Options, plus the consideration deemed to have been
received by the Corporation (determined pursuant to Section 4(d)(v)) upon the issue of the
Convertible Securities with respect to which such Options were actually exercised; and

(5) if such record date shall have been fixed and such Options or
Convertible Securities are not issued on the date fixed therefor, the adjustment previously made in
the Conversion Price which became effective on such record date shall be canceled as of the close of
business on such record date, and thereafter the Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this
paragraph 4(d)(iii) as of the actual date of their issuance.

(iv) Adjustment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional Shares
of Common. In the event this Corporation shall issue Additional Shares of Common (including

Additional Shares of Common deemed to be issued pursuant to paragraph 4(d)(iii)) without
consideration or for a consideration per share less than the applicable Conversion Price of a series of
Preferred Stock in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such issue, then, the Conversion
Price of the affected series of Preferred Stock shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a
price (calculated to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction,
the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to such issue plus the number of shares which the aggregate consideration received by the
Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of Common so issued would purchase at such
Conversion Price, and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of such Additional Shares of Common
so issued. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Conversion Price shall not be reduced at such time if
the amount of such reduction would be less than $0.01, but any such amount shall be carried
forward, and a reduction will be made with respect to such amount at the time of, and together with,
any subsequent reduction which, together with such amount and any other amounts so carried
forward, equal $0.01 or more in the aggregate. For the purposes of this Subsection 4(d)(iv), all
shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock and
the exercise and/or conversion of any other outstanding Convertible Securities and all outstanding
Options shall be deemed to be outstanding.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this subsection 4(d),
the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue (or deemed issue) of any Additional
Shares of Common shall be computed as follows:

(1) Cash and Property. Such consideration shall:
(a) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the aggregate
amount of cash received by the Corporation before deducting any reasonable discounts,

commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the Corporation for any underwriting or
otherwise in connection with such issuance;

wi ie
(b) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair market value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors; and

(c) in the event Additional Shares of Common are issued
together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for consideration which
covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in clauses (a)
and (b) above, as reasonably determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(2) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per share
received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common deemed to have been issued pursuant
to paragraph 4(d)(iii) shall be determined by dividing

(x) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Corporation as
consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the minimum aggregate
amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to
any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration) payable to the
Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options for
Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities by

(y) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set forth in the
instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent
adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities.

(e) Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of Common Stock. In the
event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided (by stock split, by payment of a

stock dividend or otherwise), into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion
Price of each series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall,
concurrently with the effectiveness of such subdivision, be proportionately decreased. In the event

series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall, concurrently with the
effectiveness of such subdivision, be proportionately decreased. In the event the outstanding shares
of Preferred Stock or a series of Preferred Stock shall be combined (by reclassification or otherwise)
into a lesser number of shares of Preferred Stock, the Dividend Rate, Original Issue Price and

increased.

(g) Adjustments for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. Subject to
Section 3 above (“Liquidation Rights”), if the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the

Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of any other class or
classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a
subdivision or combination of shares provided for above), then, in any such event, in lieu of the
number of shares of Common Stock which the holders would otherwise have been entitled to receive
each holder of such Preferred Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such shares of Preferred
Stock into a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock which a holder of the number of
shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of such series of Preferred Stock immediately
before that change would have been entitled to receive in such reorganization or reclassification, all
subject to further adjustment as provided herein with respect to such other shares.

(h)  Certificate_as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation at its expense shall
promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish
to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and
showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation
shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be
furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and readjustments, (ii) the
Conversion Price at the time in effect and (iii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the
amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon the conversion of
Preferred Stock.

(i) Waiver of Adjustment of Conversion Price. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, any downward adjustment of the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock

may be waived by the consent or vote of the holders of the majority of the outstanding shares of such
series either before or after the issuance causing the adjustment. Any such waiver shall bind all
future holders of shares of such series of Preferred Stock.

(j) Notices of Record Date. In the event that this Corporation shall propose at any
time:

(i) to declare any Distribution upon its Common Stock, whether in cash,
property, stock or other securities, whether or not a regular cash dividend and whether or not out of
earnings or earned surplus;

(ii) to effect any reclassification or recapitalization of its Common Stock
outstanding involving a change in the Common Stock; or

(iii) to voluntarily liquidate or dissolve or to enter into any transaction
deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation pursuant to Section 3(d);

CS
then, in connection with each such event, this Corporation shall send to the holders of the
Preferred Stock prior written notice of the date on which a record shall be taken for such Distribution
(and specifying the date on which the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled thereto and, if
applicable, the amount and character of such Distribution) or for determining rights to vote in respect
of the matters referred to in (i), (ii) and (iii) above.

Such written notice shall be given by first class mail (or express courier), postage prepaid,
addressed to the holders of Preferred Stock at the address for each such holder as shown on the
books of the Corporation and shall be deemed given on the date such notice is mailed.

The notice provisions set forth in this section may be shortened or waived prospectively or
retrospectively by the consent or vote of the holders of a majority of the Preferred Stock, voting as a
single class and on an as-converted basis.

(k) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at all
times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock solely

for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock, such number of its
shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then
outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding
shares of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion
of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such
number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.

5. Voting.

(a) Restricted Class Voting. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or as
required by law, the holders of Preferred Stock and the holders of Common Stock shall vote together

(b) No Series Voting. Other than as provided herein or required by law, there
shall be no series voting.

Preferred Stock shall be entitled to vote on all matters on which the Common Stock shall be entitled
to vote. Holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to notice of any stockholders’ meeting in
accordance with the Bylaws of the Corporation. Fractional votes shall not, however, be permitted
and any fractional voting rights resulting from the above formula (after aggregating all shares into
which shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder could be converted), shall be disregarded.

directors. The holders of Series D Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, shall be entitled to

members of the Board of Directors shall be elected by a majority of the Preferred Stock and
Common Stock voting together as a single class on an as-converted to Common Stock basis.

(e) Adjustment in Authorized Common Stock. The number of authorized shares
of Common Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares of Common
Stock then outstanding) by an affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock of the
Corporation.

(f) Common Stock. Each holder of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to
one vote for each share thereof held.
