entitled to receive, on an equal priority, pari passy basis, dividends, out of any assets legally
available therefor, in the amount of $0.0352 per share per annum with respect to the Series A
Preferred Stock, as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations or splits with respect to such
shares; $0.073 per share per annum with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock, as adjusted for

each case payable when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors. Such dividends shall not

whether in cash or property, shall be paid or declared (payable other than in Common Stock), nor
shall any other distribution be made, on the Common Stock, nor shall any shares of Commun
Stock of the Company be purchased, redeemed, or otherwise acquired for value by the Company
(except for acquisitions of Common Stock by the Company pursuant to agreements which permit
the Company to repurchase such shares, at the original purchase price for such shares, upon
termination of services to the Company or in exercise of the Company’s right of first refusal
upon a proposed transfer) until all then declared but unpaid dividends on the Preferred Stock
shall have been paid or set apart. In the event that dividends are paid on any share of Common
Stock, an additional dividend shall be paid with respect to all outstanding shares of Preferred
Stock in an amount equal per share (on an as-converted basis) to the amount paid or set aside for
each share of Common Stock.

(b) Non-Cash Dividends. In the event that a dividend provided for in
this Section 2 shali be payeble in property other than cash, the value of such dividend shall be
deemed to be the fair market value of such property as determined in good faith by the Board.

2. Liquidation Preference.

(a) In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation, either voluntary or involuntary, the holders of Preferred Stock shal) be entitled to
receive, prior and in preference to any distribution of any of the assets of the Corporation to the
holders of Common Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount per share equal to the
sum of (i) $0.44 for each outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock as adjusted for any stock
dividends, combinations, splits or recapitalizations with respect to such shares, (ii) $0.73 for each
outstanding share of Series B Preferred Stock as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations,
splits or recapitalizations with respect to such shares, (iii) $0.59 for each outstanding share of

recapitalizations with respect to such shares, (iv) $0.43 for each outstanding share of Series D
Preferred Stock as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits or recapitalizations with
respect to such shares and (v) $0.827 for each outstanding share of Series E Preferred Stock as
adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits or recapitalizations with respect to such
shares (the “Original Issue Price,” respectively for each series of Preferred Stock), plus (vi) any
declared but unpaid dividends on such share. If upon the occurrence of such event, the assets
and funds thus distributed among the holders of the Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to
permit the payment to such holders of the full aforesaid preferential amounts, then, the entire
assets and funds of the Corporation legally available for distribution shall be distributed first,
ratably among the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock and the Series E Preferred Stock on a
pari passu basis in proportion to the total preferential amount to which each such holder is
entitled, second, ratably among the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock in proportion to the
total preferential amount to which each such holder is entitled, and third, ratably among the

(a) of this Section 2, all of the remaining assets of the Corporation available for distribution to
shareholders shall be distributed ratably among the holders of Common Stock in proportion to
the number of shares of Common Stock owned by each such holder.

(c) (i) For purposes of this Section 2, a liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation shall be deemed to be occasioned by, or to include, (A) the
acquisition of the Corporation by another entity or entities, acting in concert, by means of any
transaction or series of related transactions (including, without limitation, any reorganization,
merger or consolidation but, excluding any merger effected exclusively for the purpose of
changing the domicile of the Corporation or the issuance of the Corporation’s equity securities
for capital raising purposes) that results in the Corporation’s shareholders constituted
immediately prior to such transaction holding less than fifty percent (50%) of the voting power
of the surviving or acquiring entity (an “Acquisition’); or (B) a sale or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Corporation (an “Asset Transfer’).

(ii) In any of such events, if the consideration received by the
Corporation is other than cash, its value will be deemed its fair market va.ue as determined in
good faith by the Corporation’s Board of Directors, except that any securities to be distributed to
the shareholders shall be valued as follows:

(A) Securities not subject to investment letter or other
similar restrictions on free marketability covered by (B) below:

the Nasdaq National Market, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing sale
pices of the securities on such quotation system over the thirty (30) day period ending three (3)
days prior to the closing;

(2) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value
shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over

(3) If there is no active public market, the value
shall be the fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Corporation and the holders

investment letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely
by virtue of a shareholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an
appropriate discount from the market value determined as above in (A) (1), (2) or (3) to reflect
the approximate fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Corporation and the

holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of such Preferred
Stock.

(iii) The Corporation shall give each holder of record of
Preferred Stock wiitten notice of such impending transaction not later than twenty (20) days
prior to the shareholders’ meeting called to approve such transaction, or twenty (20) days prior to
the closing of such transaction, whichever is earlier, and shall also notify such holders in writing

$VW51720.6
of the final approval of such transaction. The first of such notices shall describe the material
terms and conditions of the impending transaction and the provisions of this Section 2, and the
Corporation shall thereafter give such holders prompt notice of any material changes. The
transaction shall in no event take place sooner than twenty (20) days after the Corporation has
given the first notice provided for herein or sooner than ten (10) days after the Corporation has
given notice of any material changes provided for herein; provided, however, that such pericds
may be shortened upon the written consent of the holders of Preferred Stock that are entitled to
such notice rights or similar notice rights and that represent at least a majority of the voting
power of all then outstanding shares of such Preferred Stock.

3. Redemption. The Preferred Stock is not redeemable.

4. Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion

convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such
share, at the office cf the \ .rporation or any transfer agent for such stock, into such number of
fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Original
Issue Price of the applicable series of Preferred Stock by the Conversion Price applicable to such
share, determined as hereafter provided, in effect on the date the certificate is surrendered for
conversion. Upon the date of the .iling of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation
with the California Secretary of State (the “File Date”), the initial Conversion Price per share for

effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ‘Securities
Act”), the public offering price of which equals or exceeds $3.50 per share (adjusted to reflect
subsequent stock dividends, stock splits or recapitalization), with a total offering, after deduction
of underwriters’ commissions and expenses, of at least $30,000,000 or (ii) the date specified by
written consent or approval of the holders of sixty-seven percent (67%) of the then outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class. Upon such automatic conversion,
any declared and unpaid dividends shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of
