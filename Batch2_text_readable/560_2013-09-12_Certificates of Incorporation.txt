distribution among the holders of such series of Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit the
payment to such holders of their full aforesaid preferential amount, then the entire amount of the
assets and funds of the Company legally available for distribution shall be distributed ratably
among the holders of such series of Preferred Stock in proportion to the aggregate preferential
amount each holder is otherwise entitled to receive. For the purposes of this Section 3,
“Proceeds” shall mean (i) all amounts of cash, stock, or other consideration payable to the

WEST\241909858,3 6
thereon plus the following amounts: (i) for the Series E-1 Preferred Stock, the Series E-1 Special
Preference Amount per share on each outstanding share of such Series E-1 Preferred Stock. If the
assets and funds thus available for distribution among the holders of Series E-1 Preferred Stock

amount, then the entire amount of the assets and funds of the Company legally available for
distribution shall be distributed ratably among the holders of Series E-1 Preferred Stock in
proportion to the aggregate preferential amount each holder is otherwise entitled to receive.

(ii) After payment of the full preferential amount set forth in
subsection 3(b)(i) above to the holders of the Series E-1 Preferred Stock, the holders of the
Series D-1 Preferred Stock, the Series C-1 Preferred Stock, the Series B-1 Preferred Stock and the
Series AA-1 Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive pari passu as among each such series of
Preferred Stock and prior and in preference to any distribution of any of the assets or surplus
funds of the Company to the holders of Common Stock as set forth in subsection 3{c) below by

such holders of their full aforesaid preferential amount, then the entire amount of the assets and
funds of the Company legally available for distribution shall be distributed ratably among the
holders of such series of Preferred Stock in proportion to the aggregate preferential amount each
holder is otherwise entitled to receive.

(c) Distribution after Payment of Liquidation Preference. After payment has
been made to the holders of the Preferred Stock of the full preferential amounts set forth in
Section 3(a) or 3(b) above, as applicable, the entire remaining assets, and funds of the Company
legally available for distribution, if any, shall be distributed ratably among the holders of Common
Stock.

(d) Shares not Treated as Both Preferred Stock and Common Stock in any
Distribution. Shares of Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to be converted into shares of
Common Stock in order to participate in any distribution, or series of distributions, as shares of
Common Stock, without first foregoing participation in the distribution, or series of distributions,
as shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 3(a) and 3(b) above. The foregoing sentence
notwithstanding, in the event of any event deemed a liquidation pursuant to subsection 3(e) below,
each holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, for each share of Preferred Stock then
held, out of the proceeds of such deemed liquidation, the greater of the amount of cash, securities
or other property to which such holder would be entitled to receive in a liquidation pursuant to
(i) Section 3(a) or 3(b) above, as applicable, or (ii) the amount of cash, securities or other property
to which such holder would be entitled to receive in a liquidation with respect to such shares if

treated as a liquidation, dissolution or winding up. A deemed liquidation, dissolution or winding
up may be waived upon the election the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock, voting on an as-converted to Common Stock basis.

(f) Non-Cash Distribution. Whenever the distribution provided for in this
Section 3 shall be payable in securities or property other than cash, the value of such distribution
shall be the fair market value of such securities or other property as determined in good faith by
the unanimous vote of the Board of Directors. Any securities shall be valued as follows:

deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the 30-

fair market value thereof, as determined by the affirmative vote of sixty-six and two-thirds

by dividing the Series D-1 Original Issue Price by the appropriate conversion price for the

to herein as the “Series D-1 Conversion Price”). The initial Series D-1 Conversion Price shall be
$0.7529 per share and shall be subject to adjustment as provided herein. The number of shares of

Conversion Rate shal] be subject to adjustment as described in this Section 4.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically
be converted into shares of Common Stock at the then effective applicable Conversion Rate for
such share immediately upon the earlier of (i) the consummation of the Company’s first firmly
underwritten public offering of the Company’s Common Stock registered under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), provided that aggregate gross proceeds to the
Company exceed $40,000,000 (before deducting underwriting discounts or commissions) (a
“Qualifying Public Offering”) or (ii) the date specified by written consent or agreement of the
holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as
a single class, on an as-converted to Common Stock basis; provided, however, that the Series D-1

(ii) without the consent of the holders of seventy-five percent (75%) of the Series D-1 Preferred
Stock and the Series E-1 Preferred Stock shall not be automatically converted into Common Stock
pursuant to this clause (ii) without the consent of the holders of seventy-five percent (75%) of the

issued upon conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder
would otherwise be entitled, the Company shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the
then fair market value of such fractional shares as determined by the Board of Directors. Before
any holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into full shares of Common
Stock, and to receive certificates therefor, he shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor,
duly endorsed, at the office of the Company or of any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, and
shall give written notice to the Company at such office that he elects to convert the same;
provided, however, that in the event of an automatic conversion pursuant to Section 4(b), the
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically without any further action
by the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates representing such shares are
surrendered to the Company or its transfer agent; provided, further, that the Company shall not be
obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such
automatic conversion unless either the certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are
delivered to the Company or its transfer agent as provided above, or the holder notifies the
Company or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and
executes an agreement and provides, if requested by the Company, a bond satisfactory to the
Company to indemnify the Company from any loss incurred by it in connection with such
certificates.

The Company shall, as soon as practicable after such delivery, or after such agreement
and indemnification, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, a
certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall

WEST\241909858.3 10
be entitled as aforesaid and promptly pay (i) in cash (by check or wire) or, to the extent that
sufficient funds are not then legally available therefor, in Common Stock (at the then-fair market
value, as determined above), any declared and unpaid dividends on shares of Preferred Stock
being converted and (ii) in cash (by check or wire) the value of any fractional shares otherwise
issuable upon such conversion. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made
immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred
Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of
such shares of Common Stock on such date; provided, however, that if the conversion is in
connection with the consummation of the first firmly underwritten public offering of the
Company’s Common Stock registered under the Securities Act (an “IPO”) or any liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Company (or deemed occurrence of such event pursuant to
subsection 3(e) above) (a “Liquidation Event”), the conversion may, at the option of any holder
tendering Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing of the sale of
securities pursuant to such IPO or Liquidation Event, in which event the person(s) entitled to
receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of the Preferred Stock shall not be
deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing or
consummation of the IPO or Liquidation Event, subject to each Conversion Price adjustment, if
any, pursuant to Section 4(d)(iii) below.

(d) Adjustments to Conversion Price for Diluting Issues. Each Conversion
Price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

(i) No Adjustment of Conversion Price. No adjustment in any
Conversion Price of a particular series of Preferred Stock shall be made in respect of the issuance
of Additional Shares of Common Stock, unless the consideration per share for the Additional
Shares of Common Stock issued or deemed to be issued by the Company is less than the
Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock in effect on the date of, and immediately
prior to, the issue of such Additional Shares of Common Stock.

(ii) | Deemed Issuances of Additional Shares of Common Stock.

(A) Options and Convertible Securities. In the event the
Company at any time or from time to time after the Series E-1 Issue Date shall issue any Options
or Convertible Securities or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class
of securities entitled to receive any such Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum
number of shares (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto without regard to any provisions
contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) of Common Stock issuable upon
the exercise of such Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities and Options therefor, the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to be Additional Shares
of Common Stock issued as of the time of such issue or, in the case such a record date shall have
been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, provided that Additional Shares of
Common Stock shall not be deemed to have been issued with respect to an adjustment of any
Conversion Price unless the consideration per share (determined pursuant to Section 4(d)(iv)
hereof) of such Additional Shares of Common Stock would be less than such Conversion Price
in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such issue, or such record date, as the case may

WEST\24 19098583 11
be, and provided further that in any such case in which Additional Shares of Common Stock are
deemed to be issued:

(1) no further adjustment in any Conversion Price shall
be made upon the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities or shares of Common Stock upon
the exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities;

(2) if such Options or Convertible Securities by their
terms provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any increase or decrease in the
consideration payable to the Company, or decrease or increase in the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable, upon the exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, each Conversion
Price computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with
respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon any such increase or
decrease becoming effective, be recomputed to take into effect such increase or decrease insofar
as it affects such Options or the rights of conversion or exchange under such Convertible
Securities;

(3) upon the expiration of any such Options or any
rights of conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have been
exercised, each Conversion Price computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon the
occurrence of a record date with respect thereto) and any subsequent adjustments based thereon
shall, upon such expiration, be recomputed as if:

a. in the case of Convertible Securities or
Options for Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common Stock issued were the
shares of Common Stock, if any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities and the consideration received therefor
was the consideration actually received by the Company for the issue of such Options, whether
or not exercised, plus the consideration actually received by the Company upon such exercise or
for the issue of all such Convertible Securities which were actually converted or exchanged, plus
the additional consideration, if any, actually received by the Company upon such conversion or
exchange, and

b. in the case of Options for Convertible
Securities only the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were
issued at the time of issue of such Options, and the consideration received by the Company for
the Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been then issued was the consideration
actually received by the Company for the issue of such Options, whether or not exercised, plus
the consideration deemed to have been received by the Company (determined pursuant to
Section 4(d){iv)) upon the issue of the Convertible Securities with respect to which such Options
were actually exercised;

(4) no readjustment pursuant to clause (2) or (3) above
shall have the effect of increasing any Conversion Price to an amount which exceeds the lower of
(i) such Conversion Price on the original adjustment date, or (ii) such Conversion Price that
would have resulted from any issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock between the
original adjustment date and such readjustment date;

WEST\241909858.3 12
(5) in the case of any Options which expire by their
terms not more than 30 days after the date of issue thereof, no adjustment of any Conversion
Price shall be made until the expiration or exercise of all such Options issued on the same date,
whereupon such adjustment shall be made in the same manner provided in clause (3) above; and

(6) if such record date shall have been fixed and such
Options or Convertible Securities are not issued on the date fixed therefor, the adjustment
previously made in any Conversion Price which became effective on such record date shall be
canceled as of the close of business on such record date, and thereafter such Conversion Price
shall be adjusted pursuant to this Section 4(d)(ii) as of the actual date of their issuance.

(B) Stock Dividends, Stock Distributions and Subdivisions. In
the event the Company at any time or from time to time after the Series E-1 Issue Date shall
declare or pay any dividend or make any other distribution on the Common Stock payable in
Common Stock or effect a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by
reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in Common Stock), then and in any
such event, Additional Shares of Common Stock shall be deemed to have been issued:

(1) in the case of any such dividend or distribution,
immediately after the close of business on the record date for the determination of holders of any
class of securities entitled to receive such dividend or distribution, or

(2) in the case of any such subdivision, at the close of
business on the date immediately prior to the date upon which such corporate action becomes
effective.

If such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend shall not have been paid on
the payment date fixed therefor, the adjustment previously made in any Conversion Price which
became effective on such record date shall be canceled as of the close of business on such record
date, and thereafter such Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this Section 4(d)(i1) as of
the time of actual payment of such dividend, if any.

(iii) | Adjustment of Conversion Price.

(A) _ In the event the Company shall issue Additional Shares of
Common Stock (including Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to
Section 4(d)(ii), but excluding Additional Shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to
Section 4(d)(ii)(B), which event is dealt with in Section 4(d)(v) hereof), without consideration or
for a consideration per share less than the applicable Conversion Price in effect on the date of
and immediately prior to such issue, then and in such event, the Conversion Price of the affected
Series of Preferred shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the
nearest cent) determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction (x) the numerator of
which shall be (1) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such
issue, plus (2) the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration
received by the Company for the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued
would purchase at such Conversion Price, and (y) the denominator of which shall be (1) the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus (2) the

WEST\24 1909858.3 13
number of such Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued, provided that for the purposes of
this Section 4(d)(iii), all shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise, conversion or
exchange of outstanding Options, Convertible Securities and shares of Preferred Stock, as the
case maybe, shall be deemed to be outstanding, and immediately after any Additional Shares of
Common Stock are deemed issued pursuant to Section 4(d)(ii) above, such Additional Shares of
Common Stock shall be deemed to be outstanding, and provided further that such Conversion
Price shall not be so reduced at such time if the amount of such reduction would be an amount
less than $0.001, but any such amount shall be carried forward and reduction with respect thereto
made at the time of and together with any subsequent reduction which, together with such
amount and any other amount or amounts so carried forward, shall aggregate $0.001 or more.

(iv) | Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this Section 4(d),
the consideration received by the Company for the issue of any Additional Shares of Common
Stock shall be computed as follows:

(A) Cash and Property. Such consideration shall:

(1) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
aggregate amount of cash received by the Company excluding amounts paid or payable for
accrued interest or accrued dividends;

(2) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith by the
affirmative vote of sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the Board of Directors; and

(3) in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock
are issued together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Company for
consideration which covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed
as provided in clauses (1) and (2) above, as determined in good faith by the affirmative vote of
sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the Board of Directors.

(B) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per
share received by the Company for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been
issued pursuant to Section 4(d)(ii)(A), relating to Options and Convertible Securities, shall be
determined by dividing:

(1) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by
the Company as consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the
minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating
thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such
consideration) payable to the Company upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the
exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities, by

(2) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock
(as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein

WEST\24 1909858.3 14
for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities.

(v) Adjustments for Subdivisions, Combinations or Consolidation of
Common Stock, In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided (by
stock split, or otherwise), into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, each Conversion
Price then in effect shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such subdivision, be
proportionately decreased. In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be
combined or consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of
Common Stock, each Conversion Price then in effect shall, concurrently with the effectiveness
of such combination or consolidation, be proportionately increased.

(vi) Adjustments for Other Distributions. In the event the Company at
any time or from time to time makes, or fixes a record date for the determination of holders of
Common Stock entitled to receive any distribution payable in securities of the Company other
than shares of Common Stock and other than as otherwise adjusted in this Section 4(d), then and
in each such event provision shall be made so that the holders of Preferred Stock shall receive
upon conversion thereof, in addition to the number of shares of Common Stock receivable
thereupon, the amount of securities of the Company which they would have received had their
Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event and had they
thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to and including the date of conversion,
retained such securities receivable by them as aforesaid during such period, subject to all other
adjustments called for during such period under this Section 4(d) with respect to the rights of the
holders of the Preferred Stock.

(vii) Adjustments for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. If
the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be changed into the
same or a different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock, whether by capital
reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares
provided for above), each Conversion Price then in effect shall, concurrently with the
effectiveness of such reorganization or reclassification, be proportionately adjusted such that the
Preferred Stock shall be convertible into, in lieu of the number of shares of Common Stock
which the holders would otherwise have been entitled to receive, a number of shares of such
other class or classes of stock equivalent to the number of shares of Common Stock that would
have been subject to receipt by the holders upon conversion of the Preferred Stock immediately
before that change.

(viii) Reorganization, Mergers, Consolidations, or Sales of Assets. To
the extent that Section 3 hereof does not apply or the holders of Preferred Stock waive their
rights under Section 3, if at any time or from time to time, there shall be a capital reorganization
of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision, combination, reclassification, or exchange of
shares provided for elsewhere in this Section 4) or a merger or consolidation of the Company
with or into another corporation, or the sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s
properties and assets to any other person, then, as a part of such reorganization, merger,
consolidation, or sale, provision shall be made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock shall
thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of the Preferred Stock held by them, the number
of shares of stock or other securities or property of the Company, or of the successor Company

WEST\241909858.3 15
resulting from such merger or consolidation or sale, to which a holder of Common Stock
deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled upon such capital reorganization, merger,
consolidation or sale. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application
of the provisions of this Section 4 with respect to the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock
after the reorganization, merger, consolidation, or sale to the end that the provisions of this
Section 4 (including adjustment of each Conversion Price then in effect and the number of shares
purchasable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event as nearly
equivalent as may be practicable.

(e) | No Impairment. The Company will not, by amendment of its Certificate of
Incorporation or through any reorganization, recapitalization, transfer of assets, merger,
consolidation, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to
avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder
by the Company but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of
this Section 4 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to
protect the conversion rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock against impairment.

(f) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of any Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4, the Company at its expense shall
promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and
furnish to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or
readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based.
The Company shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock, furnish
or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and
readjustments, (ii) the applicable Conversion Price at the time in effect, and (iii) the number of
shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be
received upon the conversion of Preferred Stock.

(g) Notices of Record Date. In the event that the Company shall propose at any
time:

(i) to declare any dividend or distribution upon its Common Stock,
whether in cash, property, stock or other securities, whether or not a regular cash dividend and
whether or not out of earnings or earned surplus;

(ii) to offer for subscription pro rata to the holders of any class or
series of its stock any additional shares of stock of any class or series or any other securities or
property, or to receive any other rights;

(iii) to effect any reclassification or recapitalization of its Common
Stock outstanding involving a change in the Common Stock; or

(iv) to merge with or into any other corporation, or sell, lease or convey
all or substantially all its property or business, or to liquidate, dissolve or wind up, including
without limitation, any deemed liquidation events as defined in Section 3(e) above;

then, in connection with each such event, this Company shall send to the holders of the Preferred
Stock at least 30 days’ prior written notice of the date on which a record shall be taken for such

WEST\241909858.3 16
dividend, distribution or subscription rights (and specifying the date on which the holders of
Common Stock shall be entitled thereto) or for determining rights to vote in respect of the
matters referred to in (iii) and (iv) above. With regard to the matters referenced in (iii) and (iv)
above, such written notice shall describe the material terms and conditions of the proposed
transaction and the Company shall thereafter give such holders prompt notice of any material
changes. The transaction shall in no event take place sooner than 30 days after the Company has
given the first notice provided for herein or sooner than 10 days after the Company has given
notice of any material changes provided for herein; provided, however, that such periods may be
shortened upon the written consent of the holders of the Preferred Stock that are entitled to such
notice rights or similar notice rights and that represent at least a majority of the voting power of
all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, voting together as single class, on an as-
converted to Common Stock basis.

Each such written notice shall be given as provided in Section 6 below.

(h) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Company shall at all
times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock
solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock, such
number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of
all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, the Company will take such corporate action as
may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of
Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose, including without
limitation using its best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval for any necessary
amendment to this certificate.

S. Voting. The holders of Preferred Stock and the holders of Common Stock shall
vote as a single class for all matters of which holders of Common Stock have the right to vote
except as otherwise provided herein in this Section 5.

(a) Preferred Stock. Each holder of shares of Preferred Stock shall be entitled
to the number of votes equal to the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of
Preferred Stock held by such holder of Preferred Stock could then be converted. The holders of
shares of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to vote on all matters on which the Common Stock
shall be entitled to vote. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to notice of any
stockholders’ meeting in accordance with the Bylaws of the Company (the “Bylaws”). Fractional
votes shall not, however, be permitted and any fractional voting rights resulting from the above
formula (after aggregating all shares into which shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder
could be converted), shall be rounded to the nearest whole number (with one-half being rounded
upward).

(b) Common Stock. Except as otherwise required by law, each holder of shares
of Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share thereof held.

(c) Election of Directors. So long as at least 5,000,000 shares of Series E-1
Preferred Stock (subject to appropriate adjustment for any subsequent stock splits, stock

WEST\241909858.3 17
dividends, recapitalizations and the like) remain outstanding, the holders of the Series E-1
Preferred Stock, voting together as a separate class and on an as-converted basis, shall be entitled
to elect one director. So long as at least 8,500,000 shares of Series AA-1 Preferred Stock (subject
to appropriate adjustment for any subsequent stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations and
the like) remain outstanding, the holders of the Series AA-1 Preferred Stock, voting together as a
separate class, shall be entitled to elect four directors. So long as at least 6,034,389 shares of
Series B-1 Preferred Stock (subject to appropriate adjustment for any subsequent stock splits,
stock dividends, recapitalizations and the like) remain outstanding, the holders of the Series B-1
Preferred Stock, voting together as a separate class, shall be entitled to elect one director. The
holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to elect one director. The holders of Preferred Stock
and Common Stock, voting together as a single class and on an as-converted basis, shall be
entitled to elect any remaining directors of the Company. Any vacancies on the Board of
Directors shall be filled by vote of the holders of that class or series of stock originally entitled to
elect the director whose absence or resignation created such vacancy.

Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class, on an as-converted to Common Stock basis:

outstanding shares of Preferred Stock; or

(B) increase or decrease the authorized number of shares of the
Series E-1 Preferred Stock.

of shares of stock of the Corporation representing a majority of the votes represented by all
outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote, irrespective of the provisions of
Section 242(b)(2) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.

from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law

WEST\24 1909858.3 20
as the same exists or may hereafter be amended. Neither any amendment nor repeal of this
