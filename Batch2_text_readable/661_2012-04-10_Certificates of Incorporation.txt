Conversion.
4.3.4.1 Terms of Conversion.

4.3.4.1.1. Optional Conversion. The holder of each share of Series A
Preferred shall have the right (the "Series A Conversion Right"), at such
holder's option, to convert such share at any time, without cost and
otherwise on the terms of this Section 4.3.4, into the number of fully paid
and non-assessable shares of Common that results from dividing:

(A) $1.00,
by:

(B) the Series A Conversion Price (as defined below) in effect at the
time of conversion.

The "Series A Conversion Price" as of the date of the filing of this
Restated Certificate (the “Filing Date”) shall be $22.6272 and shall be
subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in this Section 4.3.4.

4.3.4.1.2. Mandatory Conversion. All of the outstanding Series A
Preferred shall, without any further action by a holder thereof, convert into
Common (a "Series A Mandatory Conversion") upon the first to occur of
the following (each a "Series A Mandatory Conversion Event"): (A) the
Company's Qualified Public Offering (as defined below), (B) at such time as
at least two-thirds of the aggregate number of shares of Series A Preferred

LIT f2- 22U7tOF7
-6-

issued prior to such time have been voluntarily converted into Common by
the holders thereof, (C) at such time as is specified in a vote or written
consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred, or (D) at such time as is specified in a vote or written consent of
the holders of at least the Series D Approval Amount with respect to the
conversion of ali Preferred into Common. In each case each share of
Series A Preferred shall be automatically converted, without cost, on the
terms of this Section 4.3.4, into the number of shares of Common into
which such share of Series A Preferred would be convertible under Section
4.3.4.1.1 immediately prior to such conversion. As used in this Restated
Certificate, "Qualified Public Offering" means the closing of a firm
commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an_ effective
registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, covering the offer
and sale of Common for the account of the Company to the public at a price
per share of not less than three times the Series D Original Purchase Price
(as adjusted for stock splits, dividends and the like) with aggregate
proceeds to the Company of not less than $50,000,000 (before deduction of
underwriters commissions and expenses).

4.3.4.2 Mechanics of Conversion.

4.3.4.2.1. Optional Conversion. A holder of any share of Series A
Preferred may exercise the Series A Conversion Right of such share by
surrendering the certificate therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the
Company or of any transfer agent for the Series A Preferred, together with
a written notice to the Company which states:

(A) that such holder elects to convert the same,
(B) the number of shares of Series A Preferred being converted, and

(C) the name or names in which such holder wishes the certificate or
certificates for shares of Common to be issued.

Thereupon the Company shall promptly issue and deliver to the holder of
such shares, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate
or certificates for the number of shares of Common to which such holder
shail be entitled. If the certificate evidencing the shares of Series A
Preferred being converted shall also evidence shares of Series A
Preferred not being converted, then the Company shall also deliver to the
holder of such certificate, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a
new stock certificate evidencing the Series A Preferred not converted.
Any dividends or distributions declared but unpaid at the time of
conversion with respect to a share of Series A Preferred so converted
shall be payable ratably to the holders of the Common issued upon such
conversion.

4.3.4.2.2 Mandatory Conversion. The Company shall give written notice

to each holder of a share of Series A Preferred (A) not more than forty (40)
nor less than twenty (20) days before the anticipated effective date of the

HLG: 337197
4.3.4.3

4.3.4.4

WHLG: 337197

-7-

registration statement with respect to any Qualified Public Offering, and
shall also give written notice to each such holder upon the occurrence of
any Qualified Public Offering; and (B) upon the occurrence of any other
Series A Mandatory Conversion Event. Following the conversion of such
shares, each holder of shares so converted may surrender the certificate
therefor at the office of the Company or any transfer agent for the Series A
Preferred. Upon such surrender, the Company shall issue and deliver to
each holder, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common to which such holder is
entitled. Any dividends or distributions declared but unpaid at the time of
conversion with respect to a share of Series A Preferred so converted shall
be payable ratably to the holders of the Common issued upon such
conversion.

Effective Date of Conversion.

4.3.4.3.1 Optional Conversion. The conversion of any shares of Series A
Preferred shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the
close of business on the date that the shares to be converted are
surrendered to the Company together with the notice required by Section
4.3.4.2.1, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of
Common issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes
as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common on such date.

4.3.4.3.2 Mandatory Conversion. The conversion of shares of Series A
Preferred shall take place upon the first to occur of the Series A Mandatory
Conversion Events, whether or not the certificates representing such
shares of Series A Preferred shali have been surrendered, or new
certificates representing the shares of Common into which such shares
have been converted shall have been issued.

Adjustment of Conversion Price.

4.3.4.4.1 Subdivision or Combination of Shares. If the Company at any
time subdivides or combines the outstanding Common after the Filing Date,
the Series A Conversion Price shall be decreased, in the case of a
subdivision, or increased, in the case of a combination, in the same
proportions as the Common is subdivided or combined, effective
automatically as of the date the Company shail take a record of the holders

of its Common for the purpose of the subdivision or combination (or if no

such record is taken, as of the effectiveness of the subdivision or
combination).

4.3.4.4.2 Stock Dividends. If the Company at any time pays a dividend, or
makes any other distribution, to holders of Common payable in shares of
Common, or fixes a record date for the determination of holders of
Common entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in
shares of Common, the Series A Conversion Price shall be decreased by
multiplying it by a fraction:
FILG:

337197

-8-

(A) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of
Common outstanding immediately prior to such dividend or distribution,
and

(B) — the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of
Common outstanding immediately after such dividend or distribution
(plus, if the Company paid cash instead of fractional shares otherwise
issuable in such dividend or distribution, the number of additional shares
which would have been outstanding had the Company issued fractional
shares instead of cash),

effective automatically as of the date the Company shall take a record of
the holders of its Common for the purpose of receiving such dividend or
distribution (or if no such record is taken, as of the effectiveness of such
dividend or distribution).

4.3.4.4.3 Reclassification, Consolidation or Merger. If at any time, as a
result of:

(A) a capital reorganization or reclassification (other than a
subdivision, combination or dividend which gives rise to adjustment of the
Series A Conversion Price pursuant to Sections 4.3.4.4.1 or 4.3.4.4.2), or

(B) a merger or consolidation of the Company with another
corporation (whether or not the Company is the surviving corporation),

the Common issuable upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred shall
be changed into or exchanged for the same or a different number of
shares of any class or classes of stock of the Company or any other
corporation, or other securities convertible into such shares, then, as a
part of such reorganization, reclassification, merger or consolidation,
appropriate adjustments shall be made in the terms of the Series A
Preferred (or of any securities into which the Series A Preferred is
changed or for which the Series A Preferred is exchanged), so that:

(X) the holders of Series A Preferred or of such substitute securities
shall thereafter be entitled to receive, upon conversion of the Series A
Preferred or of such substitute securities, the kind and amount of shares
of stock, other securities, money and property which such holders would
have received at the time of such capital reorganization, reclassification,
merger, or consolidation, if such holders had converted their Series A
Preferred into Common immediately prior to such capital reorganization,
reclassification, merger, or consolidation, and

(Y) the Series A Preferred or such substitute securities shall thereafter
be adjusted on terms as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the
adjustments theretofore provided in this Section 4.3.4.4.

The provisions of this Section 4.3.4.4.3 shall similarly apply to successive
capital reorganizations, reclassifications, mergers, and consolidations.

(B) _ If at any time the Company issues (or is deemed by the express
provisions of Section 4.3.4.4.5 to have issued or sold) Additional Shares
of Common without consideration or for a consideration per share less
than the iower of (i) the Series A Conversion Price in effect at such
issuance or (ii) the Series C Conversion Price in effect at such issuance,
then the Series A Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently with
such issuance, to a price (calculated to the nearest cent) equal to the
price determined by multiplying the Series A Conversion Price by a
fraction:

(1) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of such
Additional Shares of Common plus the number of shares of
Common which the aggregate consideration received (or by the
express provisions hereof deemed to have been received) by the
Company for the total number of such Additional Shares of
Common so issued would purchase at the Series A Conversion
Price, and

(2) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Outstanding immediately after the issuance of such
Additional Shares of Common;

provided, however, that in no event shall the Series A Conversion Price
be reduced below $.01.

(C) The term "Common Outstanding" shall include all Common
issued and outstanding and issuable upon exercise or conversion of all
outstanding Convertible Securities. In the case of Convertible Securities
which are, by their terms, convertible into securities that have not yet
been authorized or designated or which are convertible into, or
exercisable for, securities at a conversion rate or exercise price (or into or
for a corresponding number of shares of Common) which may not be
determined at the time of the determination under Section 4.3.4.4.4(B),
such Convertible Securities shall be deemed to be converted or exercised
based upon a rate or price (and for a number of shares of Common)
reflecting: (i) if such Convertible Securities have a provision which
contains a price or rate which is fixed or can be fixed as of the date of the
determination under Section 4.3.4.4.4(B), then such price or rate or (ii)
otherwise, at the price of securities issued in the Company's most recent
equity financing.

4.3.4.4.5 Convertible Securities.

(A) As used in this Restated Certificate, the term "Convertible
Securities" means all rights or options for the purchase of, or stock or

respect to Series B Preferred, Section 4.5.4.4.4 with respect to Series B-1
Preferred, Section 4.6.4.4.4 with respect to Series C Preferred or
4.7.4.4.4 with respect to Series D Preferred Shares, if at any time or from
time to time after the first date of issuance of any Series A Preferred,
Series B Preferred, Series B-1 Preferred, Series C Preferred or Series D
Preferred, as applicable, the Company issues or sells Convertible
Securities (other than options or rights exercisable for or convertible into
shares of Common referred to in clauses (3), (5) and (7) of the definition
of Additional Shares of Common Stock), then in each case the Company
shall be deemed to have issued at the time of the issuance of such
Convertible Securities the maximum number of Additional Shares of
Common Stock (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, giving
effect to any provision contained therein for a subsequent upward
adjustment of such number) issuable upon exercise or conversion thereof
and to have received as consideration therefor an amount equal to the
total amount of the consideration, if any, received by the Company for the
issuance of such Convertible Securities plus the minimum amounts of
consideration, if any (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto,
giving effect to any provision contained therein for a subsequent
downward adjustment of such consideration), payable to the Company
upon the exercise or conversion of such Convertible Securities and the
minimum amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Company
(other than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such
Convertible Securities which were deemed to have been received by the
Company on issuance of such Convertible Securities) upon the exercise
of any Convertible Securities issuable upon the exercise or conversion of
such Convertible Securities. No further adjustment of the Conversion
Price for Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred, Series B-1 Preferred,
Series C Preferred or Series D Preferred, as applicable, adjusted upon
the issuance of such Convertible Securities, shall be made as a result of
the actual issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock on the
exercise or the conversion of any such Convertible Securities; provided,
however, that if the Convertible Securities or the conversion privilege
represented by any such Convertible Securities shail expire without
having been exercised, or are exercised for a lesser number of Additional
Shares of Common Stock or with a greater consideration paid to the
Company than was previously deemed to be issued or received by the
Company, the Conversion Price for Series A Preferred, Series B
Preferred, Series B-1 Preferred, Series C Preferred or Series D Preferred,
as applicable, adjusted upon the issuance of such Convertible Securities
shall be readjusted to the Conversion Price for Series A Preferred, Series
B Preferred, Series B-1 Preferred, Series C Preferred or Series D
Preferred, as applicable, which would have been in effect had an
adjustment been made on the basis that the only Additional Shares of
Common Stock so issued were the Additional Shares of Common Stock,
if any, actually issued or sold on the exercise or conversion of such
Convertible Securities, and such Additional Shares of Common Stock, if
any, were issued or sold for the consideration actually received by the
-12-

Company upon such exercise, plus the consideration, if any, actually
received by the Company for the granting of all such Convertible
Securities constituting warrants or options, whether or not exercised, plus
the consideration received for issuing or selling the Convertible Securities
actually converted plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the
Company (other than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced
by such Convertible Securities which were deemed to have been
received by the Company on issuance of such Convertible Securities) on
the conversion of such Convertible Securities.

4.3.4.4.6 Valuation of Consideration. For purposes of the operation of
Sections 4.3.4.4.4, 4.3.4.45, 44444 44445, 45.444, 4.5.4.4.5,

Company for any issue or sale of securities shall:

{A) _ to the extent it consists of cash, be computed as the aggregate
amount of cash received by the Company;

(B) to the extent it consists of property other than cash, be computed
at the fair value of that property as determined in good faith by the Board
of Directors; and

(C) if Additional Shares of Common or Convertible Securities are
issued or sold together with other stock or securities or other assets of the
Company for a consideration that covers both, be computed as the
portion of the consideration so received that may be reasonably
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors to be allocable to such
Additional Shares of Common or Convertible Securities.

4.3.4.4.7 Liquidating Dividends. Subject to the preferential rights of
holders of Series B Preferred pursuant to the provisions of Section
4.4.4.4.7, holders of Series B-1 Preferred pursuant to the provisions of
Section 4.5.4.4.7, holders of Series C Preferred pursuant to the provisions
of Section 4.6.4.4.7 and holders of Series D Preferred pursuant to 4.7.4.4.7,

return of capital or other than as a dividend payable out of funds legally
available for dividends under the laws of the State of Delaware, the holders
of the Series A Preferred shall be entitled to receive, without payment of
any consideration therefor, the assets that would have been payable to
them as owners of that number of shares of Common receivable by
exercise of such Series A Conversion Rights, had they been the holders of
record of such Common on the record date for such distribution; and an
appropriate provision therefor shall be made a part of any such distribution
in accordance with the preferential provisions of Section 4.3.3 of this
Restated Certificate.

4.3.4.5 Reservation of Shares. The Company will take such corporate action as

reserved out of its authorized but unissued Common for the sole purpose of issuance
upon conversion of shares of Series A Preferred, a sufficient number of shares of
Common to permit the conversion in full of all outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred.

4.3.46 Full Consideration. All shares of Common which shall be issued upon the
conversion of any Series A Preferred will, upon issuance, be fully paid and non-
assessable. The Company will pay such amounts and will take such other action as
may be necessary from time to time so that all shares of Common which shall be
issued upon the exercise of the Series A Conversion Right of any Series A Preferred
will, upon issuance and without cost to the recipient, be free from all preemptive rights,
taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issue thereof.

4.3.4.7 Notice of Adjustment Events. Whenever the Company contemplates the

A Preferred, by first class mail postage prepaid, promptly after each adjustment, a
certificate signed by its President or a Vice President and by its Chief Financial Officer,
Secretary or Assistant Secretary, setting forth, in reasonable detail, the event requiring
the adjustment, the amount of the adjustment, the method by which such adjustment

made any determination hereunder), and the Series A Conversion Price and the kind
of securities issuable upon the conversion of Series A Preferred after giving effect to
such adjustment.

4.3.5.2 No share of Series A Preferred shall be redeemed under the provisions of
this Section 4.3.5 if there are shares of Series B Preferred, Series B-1 Preferred,

HLG: 337197
-14-

4.3.5.3 Subject to the limitation set forth in Section 4.3.5.2, at any time on or after
the Redemption Trigger Date, the holders of at least 60% of the outstanding Series A
Preferred shall have the right to elect to require the Company to redeem all
outstanding shares of Series A Preferred. Within not more than fifteen (15) business
days after receipt of written notice of such election (‘Series A Redemption Election’),
the Company will provide a written notice (“Series A Redemption Notice’) advising
each holder of Series A Preferred of the proposed redemption in the form required
under Section 4.3.5.3.1. The Board of Directors shall establish the date on which the
Series A Preferred will be redeemed (“Series A Redemption Date”), which date will
be not less than thirty (80) nor more than ninety (90) days after the date the Company
receives the Series A Redemption Election. On the Series A Redemption Date, the
Company will redeem for cash, out of funds legally available for such purpose, all
shares of Series A Preferred at a price per share equal to the Series A Original
Purchase Price (such amount to be adjusted proportionately in the event the shares of
Series A Preferred are subdivided into a greater number or combined into a lesser
number) plus all declared but unpaid dividends on such shares (the "Series A
Redemption Price’).

4.3.5.3.1 The Series A Redemption Notice shall state:

(a) that the holders of at least 60% of the outstanding Series A Preferred
have elected to require the Company to redeem all outstanding
shares of Series A Preferred,

(b) the amount of funds legally available for such redemption and the
maximum number of shares of Series A Preferred the Company can
redeem,

(c) the Series A Redemption Date, and

(d) that each holder is to surrender to the Company in the manner
designated at the Company's principal place of business, its
certificate or certificates representing the shares of Series A Preferred
to be redeemed.

4.3.5.4 Each holder of shares of Series A Preferred being redeemed shall
surrender the certificate or certificates representing such shares to the Company, at
the Company's principal place of business. Upon such surrender (but not earlier than
the Series A Redemption Date) the Series A Redemption Price for such shares shall
be payable to the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or
certificates as the owner thereof, and each surrendered certificate shall be cancelled
and retired. If a certificate is surrendered and all the shares evidenced thereby cannot
be redeemed, the Company shall cause certificates evidencing the shares not being
redeemed to be issued in the name of the registered owner of such shares and to be
delivered to such person.

4.3.5.5 If the Series A Redemption Price is either paid or made available for
payment through the deposit arrangement specified in Section 4.3.5.6 with respect to
any shares of Series A Preferred, then notwithstanding that the certificates evidencing
any of the shares to be redeemed shall not have been surrendered, all rights with

EIT #2. 323971097
4.3.6

-15-

respect to such shares shall terminate as of the Series A Redemption Date, except
only the right of the holder to receive the Series A Redemption Price upon surrender of
the certificate evidencing such shares.

4.3.5.6 Subject to Section 4.3.5.2, within 10 business days of the Company's
receipt of the Series A Redemption Election, the Company shall deposit with any bank
or trust company having a capital and surplus of at feast $50,000,000 as a trust fund, a
sum equal to the aggregate Series A Redemption Price of all outstanding shares of
Series A Preferred with irrevocable instructions and authority to the bank or trust
company to pay, on or after the Series A Redemption Date, the Series A Redemption
Price to the respective holders of Series A Preferred upon the surrender of their share
certificates. From and after the date of such deposit, the shares so called for
redemption shall be redeemed. The deposit shall constitute full payment of the shares
to their holders, and from and after the Series A Redemption Date, the shares shall be
deemed to be no longer outstanding, and the holders thereof shall cease to be
shareholders with respect thereto and shall have no rights with respect thereto except
the rights to receive from the bank or trust company payment of the Series A
Redemption Price of the shares, without interest, upon surrender of their certificates
therefor {and a certificate for those shares, if any, evidenced by such certificates which
are not being redeemed on such Series A Redemption Date). Any funds so deposited
and unclaimed at the end of one year from such Series A Redemption Date shail be
released or repaid to the Company, after which the former holders of the shares called
for redemption shall be entitled to receive payment of the Series A Redemption Price
with respect to such shares only from the Company.

4.3.5.7 Subject to Section 4.3.5.2 hereof, if the funds of the Company legally
available therefor shall be insufficient to discharge the Series A Preferred redemption
requirement in full, funds to the extent legally available for such purpose shall be set
aside upon the Company's receipt of a Series A Redemption Election in accordance
with Section 4.3.5.6. The maximum number of full shares of Series A Preferred that
can be redeemed with such funds shall be redeemed from the holders of shares of
Series A Preferred as of the date of such Series A Redemption Election ratably in
accordance with the full amounts otherwise payable to them. Thereafter, the
Company shall redeem shares of Series A Preferred ratably from the hoiders thereof
as funds legally available therefor become available.

4.3.5.8 Nothing in this Section 4.3.5 shall prevent any holder of shares of Series A
Preferred from exercising the Series A Conversion Right of such shares at any time
prior to the actual redemption of such shares.

No Reissuance of Series A Preferred. No share or shares of Series A Preferred
acquired by the Company by reason of redemption, purchase, conversion or otherwise
shall be reissued, and all such shares shall be canceled, retired and eliminated from
the shares which the Company shall be authorized to issue.

4.4 Powers and Qualifications of Series B Preferred Stock. The powers, preferences and
rights, and the qualifications, restrictions or limitations, of the Series B Preferred are as follows:

shareholders of the Company and to have the number of votes equal to the number
(including any fraction) of shares of Common into which such share of Series B

the determination of shareholders entitled to vote on such matter or, if no such record
date is established, at the date such vote is taken or any written consent of

hereafter defined) (such amount to be adjusted proportionately in the event the shares
of Series B Preferred are subdivided into a greater number or combined into a lesser
number) per annum, payable out of funds legally available therefor. Such dividends
shall be (i) payable only when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors, (ii) non-
cumulative and (iii) pari passu with dividends payable to the holders of the Series B-1

fiscal year of the Company until dividends in the total amount determined in
accordance with Section 4.4.2.1 (adjusted in accordance therewith, if applicable) on
the Series B Preferred shall have been paid or declared and set apart during that fiscal
year, and no dividends (other than those payable on Common solely in shares of
Common) shall be paid on any share of Series B-1 Preferred, Series A Preferred or
Common, unless a dividend is paid with respect to ail outstanding shares of Series B
Preferred in an amount for each such share of Series B Preferred equal to or greater
than the aggregate amount of such dividends for all shares of Common into which
each such share of Series B Preferred could then be converted (assuming, for the
purposes of calculating the amount of dividends to be paid under this section, in the
case of dividends declared on shares of Series B-1 Preferred or Series A Preferred,
that such shares of Series B-1 Preferred or Series A Preferred, as applicable, had
been converted into shares of Common and such dividends had been declared on the
shares of Common issued upon conversion thereof).

4.4.2.3 In the event any dividend or other distribution payable in cash or other
property (other than securities of the Company the issuance of which gives rise to
adjustments pursuant to Section 4.4.4.4 of this Restated Certificate) is declared on any

dividend or distribution shail be entitled to receive, pari passu with the dividends
payable to the holders of Series B-1 Preferred pursuant to Section 4.5.2.3, in addition
to any dividend under 4.4.2.1, on the date of payment or distribution of such dividend
or other distribution the same cash or other property which such holder would have

4.4.3

-17-

received on such record date if such holder were the holder of record of the number
(including any fraction) of shares of Common into which the shares of Series B
Preferred then held by such holder are then convertible.

Liquidation Rights.

4.4.3.1 Subject to the rights of holders of Series D Preferred pursuant to Section
4.7.3 and holders of Series C Preferred pursuant to the provisions of Section 4.6.3, if
the Company shail be voluntarily or involuntarily liquidated, dissolved or wound up, the

voluntary or involuntary, and subject to payment to holders of Series D Preferred of the
full preferential amount pursuant to Section 4.7.3.1 and holders of Series C Preferred
of the full preferential amount pursuant to Section 4.6.3.1, the assets to be distributed
to the holders of Series B Preferred and the holders of Series B-1 Preferred shall be

4.4.3.1 and 4.5.3.1 of this Restated Certificate, then all of the then-remaining assets of
the Company to be distributed shail be distributed ratably to the holders of Series B
Preferred and Series B-1 Preferred, based upon the amounts which would otherwise

4.4.3.3 Upon the dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company, whether

Certificate, shall be distributed ratably to all holders of Common and Preferred on an
as-converted basis.

4.4.3.4 Unless waived by the holders of at least the Series D Approval Amount,
each of the Deemed Liquidation Events specified in Section 4.3.3.4 shall be treated as
a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company and shail entitle the holders of
shares of all series of Preferred and Common to receive at the closing in cash,
securities or other property (valued as provided in Sections 4.3.3.5, 4.4.3.5, 4.5.3.5,
4.6.3.5 and 4.7.3.5) the amounts specified in Sections 4.3.3.1 through 4.3.3.5, 4.4.3.1

Board of Directors.

444 Conversion.

4.4.4.1

HLG: 337197

Terms of Conversion.

4.4.4.1.1 Optional Conversion. The holder of each share of Series B
Preferred shall have the right (the "Series B Conversion Right"), at such
holder's option, to convert such share at any time, without cost and
otherwise on the terms of this Section 4.4.4, into the number of fully paid
and non-assessable shares of Common that results from dividing:

(A) $1.76,
by:

(B) the Series B Conversion Price (as defined herein) in effect at the
time of conversion.

The "Series B Conversion Price" as of the date of the Filing Date shall
be $22.6272 and shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as
provided in this Section 4.4.4,

4.4.4.1.2 Mandatory Conversion. All of the outstanding Series B
Preferred shall, without any further action by a holder thereof, convert into
Common {a "Series B Mandatory Conversion") upon the first to occur of
the following (each a “Series B Mandatory Conversion Event’): (A) the
Company's Qualified Public Offering, (B) at such time as at least two-thirds
of the aggregate number of shares of Series B Preferred and Series B-1
Preferred, collectively, issued prior to such time have been voluntarily
converted into Common by the holders thereof, (C) at such time as is
specified in a vote or written consent of the holders of at least a majority of
the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred and Series B-1 Preferred,
voting together as a single class, on an as-converted basis, or (D) at such
time as is specified in a vote or written consent of the holders of at least the
Series D Approval Amount with respect to the conversion of all Preferred
into Common. In each case each share of Series B Preferred shall be
automatically converted, without cost, on the terms of this Section 4.4.4,
into the number of shares of Common into which such share of Series B
Preferred would be convertible under Section 4.4.4.1.1 immediately prior to
such conversion.

4.4.4.1.3 Prior Pay to Play Conversions. Seventy-five percent (75%)
of any shares of Series B Preferred issued after the Filing Date pursuant to
the Put Agreement shall immediately upon issuance convert into the
number of shares of Common into which such share of Series B Preferred

conversion. All shares of Common issued to any holder of Series B
Preferred as a result of conversion pursuant to this Section 4.4.4.1.3 shall
4.4.4.2

HIG: 337197

-19-

be aggregated for the purpose of determining the number of shares of
Common to which such holder shall be entitled, and no fractional shares
shall be issued in connection with such conversion. No cash in lieu of any
fractional share shall be paid to any stockholder as a result of conversion
pursuant to this Section 4.4.4.1.3.

Mechanics of Conversion.

4.4.4.2.1. Optional Conversion. A holder of any share of Series B
Preferred may exercise the Series B Conversion Right of such share by
surrendering the certificate therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the
Company or of any transfer agent for the Series B Preferred, together with
a written notice to the Company which states:

(A) that such holder elects to convert the same,
(B) the number of shares of Series B Preferred being converted, and

(C) the name or names in which such holder wishes the certificate or
certificates for shares of Common to be issued.

Thereupon the Company shall promptly issue and deliver to the holder of
such shares, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate
or certificates for the number of shares of Common to which such holder
shall be entitled. If the certificate evidencing the shares of Series B
Preferred being converted shall also evidence shares of Series B
Preferred not being converted, then the Company shall also deliver to the
holder of such certificate, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a
new stock certificate evidencing the Series B Preferred not converted.
Any dividends or distributions declared but unpaid at the time of
conversion with respect to a share of Series B Preferred so converted
shall be payable ratably to the holders of the Common issued upon such
conversion, pari passu with the payment of such dividends or distributions
payable pursuant to Section 4.5.4.2.1.

4.4.4.2.2. Mandatory Conversion. The Company shall give written notice
to each holder of a share of Series B Preferred (A) not more than forty (40)
nor less than twenty (20) days before the anticipated effective date of the
registration statement with respect to any Qualified Public Offering, and
shall also give written notice to each such holder upon the occurrence of
any Qualified Public Offering; and (B) upon the occurrence of any other
Series B Mandatory Conversion Event. Following the conversion of such
shares, each holder of shares so converted may surrender the certificate
therefor at the office of the Company or any transfer agent for the Series B
Preferred. Upon such surrender, the Company shall issue and deliver to
each holder, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common to which such holder is
entitled. Any dividends or distributions declared but unpaid at the time of
conversion with respect to a share of Series B Preferred so converted shall
be payable ratably to the holders of the Common issued upon such
4.4.43

4.4.4.4

HLG: 337197

-20-

conversion, pari passu with the payment of such dividends or distributions
payable pursuant to Section 4.5.4.2.2.

Effective Date of Conversion.

4.4.4.3.1 Optional Conversion. The conversion of any shares of Series B
Preferred shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the
close of business on the date that the shares to be converted are
surrendered to the Company together with the notice required by Section
4.4.4.2.1, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of
Common issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes
as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common on such date.

4.4.4,3.2 Mandatory Conversion. The conversion of shares of Series B
Preferred shail take place upon the first to occur of the Series B Mandatory
Conversion Events, whether or not the certificates representing such
shares of Series B Preferred shall have been surrendered, or new
certificates representing the shares of Common into which such shares
have been converted shall have been issued.

Adjustment of Conversion Price.

4.4.4.4.1 Subdivision or Combination of Shares. If the Company at any
time subdivides or combines the outstanding Common after the Filing Date,
the Series B Conversion Price shall be decreased, in the case of a
subdivision, or increased, in the case of a combination, in the same
proportions as the Common is subdivided or combined, effective
automatically as of the date the Company shall take a record of the holders
of its Common for the purpose of the subdivision or combination (or if no
such record is taken, as of the effectiveness of the subdivision or
combination).

4.4.4.4.2 Stock Dividends. If the Company at any time pays a dividend, or
makes any other distribution, to holders of Common payable in shares of
Common, or fixes a record date for the determination of holders of
Common entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in
shares of Common, the Series B Conversion Price shall be decreased by
multiplying it by a fraction:

(A) | the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of
Common outstanding immediately prior to such dividend or distribution,
and

(B) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of
Common outstanding immediately after such dividend or distribution
(plus, if the Company paid cash instead of fractional shares otherwise
issuable in such dividend or distribution, the number of additional shares
which would have been outstanding had the Company issued fractional
shares instead of cash),
HLG

337197

-21-

effective automatically as of the date the Company shall take a record of
the holders of its Common for the purpose of receiving such dividend or
distribution (or if no such record is taken, as of the effectiveness of such
dividend or distribution).

4.4.4.4.3 Reclassification, Consolidation or Merger. If at any time, as a
result of:

(A) a capital reorganization or reclassification (other than a
subdivision, combination or dividend which gives rise to adjustment of the
Series B Conversion Price pursuant to Sections 4.4.4.4.1 or 4.4.4.4.2), or

(B) a merger or consolidation of the Company with another
corporation (whether or not the Company is the surviving corporation),

the Common issuable upon the conversion of the Series B Preferred shall
be changed into or exchanged for the same or a different number of
shares of any class or classes of stock of the Company or any other
corporation, or other securities convertible into such shares, then, as a
part of such reorganization, reclassification, merger or consolidation,
appropriate adjustments shall be made in the terms of the Series B
Preferred (or of any securities into which the Series B Preferred is
changed or for which the Series B Preferred is exchanged), so that:

(X) the holders of Series B Preferred or of such substitute securities
shall thereafter be entitled to receive, upon conversion of the Series B
Preferred or of such substitute securities, the kind and amount of shares
of stock, other securities, money and property which such holders would
have received at the time of such capita! reorganization, reclassification,
merger, or consolidation, if such holders had converted their Series B
Preferred into Common immediately prior to such capital reorganization,
reclassification, merger, or consolidation, and

(Y) the Series B Preferred or such substitute securities shall thereafter
be adjusted on terms as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the
adjustments theretofore provided in this Section 4.4.4.4.

The provisions of this Section 4.4.4.4.3 shall similarly apply to successive
capital reorganizations, reciassifications, mergers, and consolidations.

4.44.4.4 Additional Shares of Common. If at any time the Company
issues (or is deemed by the express provisions of Section 4.3.4.4.5 to have
issued or sold) Additional Shares of Common without consideration or for a
consideration per share less than the lower of (i) the Series B Conversion
Price in effect at such issuance or (ii) the Series C Conversion Price in
effect at such issuance, then the Series B Conversion Price shall be
reduced, concurrently with such issuance, to a price (calculated to the
nearest cent) equal to the price determined by multiplying the Series B
Conversion Price by a fraction:
-22-

(A) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common
Outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Shares
of Common plus the number of shares of Common which the aggregate
consideration received (or by the express provisions hereof deemed to
have been received) by the Company for the total number of such
Additional Shares of Common so issued would purchase at the Series B
Conversion Price, and

(B) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Outstanding immediately after the issuance of such Additional
Shares of Common;

provided, however, that in no event shall the Series B Conversion Price
be reduced below $.01.

by the Company for any issue or sale of securities shall be determined as

holders of Series D Preferred pursuant to the provisions of Section
4.7.4.4.7 and holders of Series C Preferred pursuant to the provisions of
Section 4.6.4.4.7, if the Company, at any time while any of the Series B
Preferred is outstanding, shall make a distribution of its assets to the
holders of its Common as a dividend in liquidation or partial liquidation or by
way of return of capital or other than as a dividend payable out of funds
legally available for dividends under the laws of the State of Delaware, the
holders of the Series B Preferred shall be entitled to receive, without
payment of any consideration therefor, the assets that would have been
payable to them as owners of that number of shares of Common receivable
by exercise of such Series B Conversion Rights, had they been the holders
of record of such Common on the record date for such distribution; and an
appropriate provision therefor shall be made a part of any such distribution
in accordance with the preferential provisions of Section 4.4.3 of this
Restated Certificate.

4.4.4.5 Reservation of Shares. The Company will take such corporate action as
may be necessary from time to time so that at all times it will have authorized, and
reserved out of its authorized but unissued Common for the sole purpose of issuance
upon conversion of shares of Series B Preferred, a sufficient number of shares of
Common to permit the conversion in full of all outstanding shares of Series B
Preferred.

4.4.4.6 Full Consideration. All shares of Common which shall be issued upon the

conversion of any Series B Preferred will, upon issuance, be fully paid and non-
assessable. The Company will pay such amounts and will take such other action as

HLG: 337197
-23-

may be necessary from time to time so that all shares of Common which shall be
issued upon the exercise of the Series B Conversion Right of any Series B Preferred
will, upon issuance and without cost to the recipient, be free from all preemptive rights,
taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issue thereof.

4.4.4.7 Notice of Adjustment Events. Whenever the Company contemplates the
occurrence of an event which would give rise to adjustments under Section 4.4.4.4, the
Company shall mail to each holder of Series B Preferred, at least 20 days prior to the

least 20 days prior to such event, a notice specifying (i) the nature of the contemplated
event, and (ii) the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such
event, and (iii) the date on which such event is expected to become effective, and (iv)
the time, if any is to be fixed, when the holders of record of Common (or other
securities) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common (or other securities)
for securities or other property deliverable in connection with such event.

4.4.4.8 Notice of Adjustments. Whenever the Series B Conversion Price or the
kind of securities issuable upon the conversion of Series B Preferred, or both, shall be
adjusted pursuant to Section 4.4.4.4, the Company shall mail to each holder of Series

4.3.5.1 above.

4.4.5.2 No share of Series B Preferred or Series B-1 Preferred shall be redeemed
under the provisions of this Section 4.4.5 or of Section 4.5.5 if there are shares of
Series D Preferred or Series C Preferred outstanding at such time unless funds
required to satisfy the Series D Redemption Price and Series C Redemption Price of
all such shares of Series D Preferred and Series C Preferred have been set apart by

than fifteen (15) business days after receipt of written notice of such election (“Series
B/B-1 Redemption Election’), the Company will provide a written notice (“Series
B/B-1 Redemption Notice’) advising each holder of Series B Preferred and/or Series

The Board of Directors shail establish the date on which the Series B Preferred and

HLG: 337197
-24-

Series B-1 Preferred will be redeemed (“Series B/B-1 Redemption Date’), which date
will be not less than thirty (30) nor more than ninety (90) days after the date the
Company receives the Series B/B-1 Redemption Election. On the Series B/B-1
Redemption Date, the Company will redeem for cash, out of funds legally available for
such purpose, all shares of Series B Preferred at a price per share equal to the Series
B Original Purchase Price (such amount to be adjusted proportionately in the event the
shares of Series B Preferred are subdivided into a greater number or combined into a
lesser number) plus all declared but unpaid dividends on such shares (the "Series B
Redemption Price") and all shares of Series B-1 Preferred at a price per share equal
to the Series B-1 Original Purchase Price (such amount to be adjusted proportionately
in the event the shares of Series B-1 Preferred are subdivided into a greater number or
combined into a lesser number) plus all declared but unpaid dividends on such shares
(the "Series B-1 Redemption Price").

4.4.5.3.1 The Series B/B-1 Redemption Notice shall state:

(a) that the holders of at least 60% of the outstanding Series B Preferred
and Series B-1 Preferred, voting together as a single class, on an as-
converted basis, have elected to require the Company to redeem all
outstanding shares of Series B Preferred and Series B-1 Preferred,

(b} the amount of funds legally available for such redemption and the
maximum number of shares of Series B Preferred and Series B-1
Preferred the Company can redeem,

(c) the Series B/B-1 Redemption Date, and

(d) that each holder is to surrender to the Company in the manner
designated at the Company’s principal place of business, its
certificate or certificates representing the shares of Series B Preferred
and Series B-1 Preferred to be redeemed.

4.4.5.4 | Each holder of shares of Series B Preferred and Series B-1 Preferred being
redeemed shall surrender the certificate or certificates representing such shares to the
Company, at the Company's principal place of business. Upon such surrender (but
not earlier than the Series B/B-1 Redemption Date) the Series B Redemption Price for
such shares of Series B Preferred and the Series B-1 Redemption Price for such
shares of Series B-1 Preferred shall be payable to the order of the person whose
name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof, and each
surrendered certificate shall be cancelled and retired. If a certificate is surrendered
and all the shares evidenced thereby cannot be redeemed, the Company shall cause
certificates evidencing the shares not being redeemed to be issued in the name of the
registered owner of such shares and to be delivered to such person.

4.4.5.5 If the Series B Redemption Price and Series B-1 Redemption Price is either
paid or made available for payment through the deposit arrangement specified in
Section 4.4.5.6 with respect to any shares of Series B Preferred and Series B-1
Preferred, then notwithstanding that the certificates evidencing any of the shares to be
redeemed shall not have been surrendered, all rights with respect to such shares shall
terminate as of the Series B/B-1 Redemption Date, except only the right of the holder

LG: 337197
4.46

-25-

to receive the Series B Redemption Price or Series B-1 Redemption Price, as the case
may be, upon surrender of the certificate evidencing such shares.

4.456 Subject to Section 4.4.5.2, within 10 business days of the Company's
receipt of the Series B/B-1 Redemption Election, the Company shall deposit with any
bank or trust company having a capital and surplus of at feast $50,000,000 as a trust
fund, a sum equal to the aggregate Series B Redemption Price of all outstanding
shares of Series B Preferred plus the aggregate Series B-1 Redemption Price of all
outstanding shares of Series B-1 Preferred with irrevocable instructions and authority
to the bank or trust company to pay, on or after the Series B/B-1 Redemption Date, the
Series B Redemption Price to the respective holders of Series B Preferred and the
Series B-1 Redemption Price to the respective holders of Series B-1 Preferred upon
the surrender of their share certificates. From and after the date of such deposit, the
shares so called for redemption shall be redeemed. The deposit shall constitute full
payment of the shares to their holders, and from and after the Series B/B-1
Redemption Date, the shares shall be deemed to be no longer outstanding, and the
holders thereof shall cease to be shareholders with respect thereto and shall have no
rights with respect thereto except the rights to receive from the bank or trust company
payment of the Series B Redemption Price or Series B-1 Redemption Price of the
shares, as the case may be, without interest, upon surrender of their certificates
therefor (and a certificate for those shares, if any, evidenced by such certificates which
are not being redeemed on such Series B/B-1 Redemption Date). Any funds so
deposited and unclaimed at the end of one year from such Series B/B-1 Redemption
Date shall be released or repaid to the Company, after which the former holders of the
shares called for redemption shall be entitled to receive payment of the Series B
Redemption Price or Series B-1 Redemption Price with respect to such shares, as the
case may be, only from the Company.

4.4.5.7 Subject to Section 4.4.5.2 hereof, if the funds of the Company legally
available therefor shail be insufficient to discharge the Series B Preferred and Series
B-1 Preferred redemption requirements in full, funds to the extent legally available for
such purpose shall be set aside upon the Company's receipt of a Series B/B-1
Redemption Election in accordance with Sections 4.4.5.6. The maximum number of
full shares of Series B Preferred and Series B-1 Preferred that can be redeemed with
such funds shall be redeemed from the holders of shares of Series B Preferred and
Series B-1 Preferred as of the date of such Series B/B-1 Redemption Election ratably
in accordance with the full amounts otherwise payable to them. Thereafter, the
Company shall redeem shares of Series B Preferred and Series B-1 Preferred ratably
from the holders thereof as funds legally available therefor become available.

4.4.5.8 Nothing in this Section 4.4.5 shall prevent any holder of shares of Series B
Preferred or Series B-1 Preferred from exercising the Series B Conversion Right or
Series B-1 Conversion right of such shares, as the case may be, at any time prior to
the actual redemption of such shares.

No Reijssuance of Series B Preferred. No share or shares of Series B Preferred
acquired by the Company by reason of redemption, purchase, conversion or otherwise
shall be reissued, and all such shares shall be canceled, retired and eliminated from
the shares which the Company shalt be authorized to issue.

Restated Certificate, each share of Series B-1 Preferred (including any fractional
share) shall entitle the holder thereof to vote on each matter submitted to a vote of the
shareholders of the Company and to have the number of votes equal to the number
(including any fraction) of shares of Common into which such share of Series B-1
Preferred is then convertible pursuant to the provisions hereof at the record date for
the determination of shareholders entitled to vote on such matter or, if no such record
date is established, at the date such vote is taken or any written consent of
shareholders becomes effective. Except as otherwise required by law or expressly
provided in this Restated Certificate, the holders of shares of Common and Preferred
of all classes shall vote together as a single class, on an as-converted basis, and not
as separate classes or series.

45.2 Dividends.

4.5.2.1 Subject to the rights of holders of Series D Preferred pursuant to the
provisions of Section 4.7.2 and holders of Series C Preferred pursuant to the
provisions of Section 4.6.2, the holders of the Series B-1 Preferred shall be entitled to
receive dividends at the rate of 8% of the Series B-1 Original Purchase Price (as
hereafter defined) (such amount to be adjusted proportionately in the event the shares
of Series B-1 Preferred are subdivided into a greater number or combined into a lesser
number) per annum, payable out of funds legally available therefor. Such dividends
shall be (i) payable only when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors, (ii) non-
cumulative and (iii) pari passu with dividends payable to the holders of the Series B
Preferred pursuant to Section 4.4.2.1. The “Series B-1 Original Purchase Price”
shalt be $1.76.

4.5.2.2 No dividends {other than those payable on Common solely in shares of
Common) shall be paid on any shares of Series A Preferred or Common during any
fiscal year of the Company until dividends in the total amount determined in
accordance with Section 4.5.2.1 (adjusted in accordance therewith, if applicable) on
the Series B-1 Preferred shall have been paid or declared and set apart during that
fiscal year, and no dividends (other than those payable on Common solely in shares of
Common) shall be paid on any share of Series B Preferred, Series A Preferred or
Common, unless a dividend is paid with respect to all outstanding shares of Series B-1
Preferred in an amount for each such share of Series B-1 Preferred equal to or greater
than the aggregate amount of such dividends for all shares of Common into which
each such share of Series B-1 Preferred could then be converted (assuming, for the
purposes of calculating the amount of dividends to be paid under this section, in the
case of dividends declared on shares of Series B Preferred or Series A Preferred, that
such shares of Series B Preferred or Series A Preferred, as applicable, had been
converted into shares of Common and such dividends had been declared on the
shares of Common issued upon conversion thereof).

4.5.2.3 In the event any dividend or other distribution payable in cash or other
property (other than securities of the Company the issuance of which gives rise to

WM: 337107
4.5.3

-27-

adjustments pursuant to Section 4.5.4.4 of this Restated Certificate) is declared on any
Common, each holder of shares of Series B-1 Preferred on the record date for such
dividend or distribution shall be entitled to receive, pari passu with the dividends
payable to the holders of Series B Preferred pursuant to Section 4.4.2.3, in addition to
any dividend under 4.5.2.1, on the date of payment or distribution of such dividend or
other distribution the same cash or other property which such holder would have
received on such record date if such holder were the holder of record of the number
{including any fraction) of shares of Common into which the shares of Series B-1
Preferred then held by such holder are then convertible.

Liquidation Rights.

4.5.3.1 Subject to the rights of holders of Series D Preferred pursuant to the
provisions of Section 4.7.3 and holders of Series C Preferred pursuant to the
provisions of Section 4.6.3, if the Company shall be voluntarily or involuntarily
liquidated, dissolved or wound up, the holder of each share of Series B-1 Preferred
then outstanding (including any fractional shares) shall be entitled to receive out of the
assets of the Company available for distribution to shareholders, pari passu with the
distribution payable to the holders of Series B Preferred pursuant to Section 4.4.3.1,
and before any payment or declaration and setting apart for payment of any amount
shall be made with respect to the Series A Preferred or Common, an amount equal to
(i) 100% of the Series B-1 Original Purchase Price (such amount to be adjusted
proportionately in the event the shares of Series B-1 Preferred are subdivided into a
greater number or combined into a lesser number), plus (ii) an amount equal to any
dividends on such share which are declared but unpaid as of such liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Company.

4.5.3.2 If, upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, whether
voluntary or involuntary, and subject to payment to holders of Series D Preferred of the
full preferential amount pursuant to Section 4.7.3.1 and holders of Series C Preferred
of the full preferential amount pursuant to Section 4.6.3.1, the assets to be distributed
to the holders of Series B Preferred and the holders of Series B-1 Preferred shall be
insufficient to permit the payment of the full preferential amount pursuant to Sections
4.4.3.1 and 4.5.3.1 of this Restated Certificate, then all of the then-remaining assets of
the Company to be distributed shall be distributed ratably to the holders of Series B
Preferred and Series B-1 Preferred, based upon the amounts which would otherwise
by payable to such holders pursuant to Section 4.4.3.1 or 4.5.3.1, as the case may be.

4.5.3.3. Upon the dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company, whether
voluntary or involuntary, the assets of the Company available for distribution to
shareholders after and in addition to the distribution of the preferential amounts
pursuant to Sections 4.7.3.1, 4.6.3.1, 4.5.3.1, 4.4.3.1 and 4.3.3.1 of this Restated
Certificate, shall be distributed ratably to all holders of Common and Preferred on an
as-converted basis.

4.5.3.4 Unless waived by the holders of at least the Series D Approval Amount,
each of the Deemed Liquidation Events specified in Section 4.3.3.4 shall be treated as
a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company and shall entitle the holders of
shares of all series of Preferred and Common to receive at the closing in cash,
securities or other property (valued as provided in Sections 4.3.3.5, 4.4.3.5, 4.5.3.5,

HLG: 337197
- 28 -

4.6.3.5 and 4.7.3.5) the amounts specified in Sections 4.3.3.1 through 4.3.3.5, 4.4.3.1
through 4.4.3.5, 4.5.3.1 through 4.5.3.5, 4.6.3.1 through 4.6.3.5 and 4.7.3.1 through

4.7.3.5.

4.5.3.5

in securities or property other than cash, the value of such distribution shall be the fair
market value of such securities or other property as determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors

4.5.4 Conversion.

4.5.4.1

HLG: 337197

Terms of Conversion.

4.5.4.1.1. Optional Conversion. The holder of each share of Series B-1
Preferred shall have the right (the "Series B-1 Conversion Right"), at such
holder's option, to convert such share at any time, without cost and
otherwise on the terms of this Section 4.5.4, into the number of fully paid
and non-assessable shares of Common that results from dividing:

(A) = $1.76,
by:

(B) the Series B-1 Conversion Price (as defined herein) in effect at the
time of conversion.

The "Series B-1 Conversion Price” as of the date of the Filing Date shall
be $22.6272 and shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as
provided in this Section 4.5.4.

4.5.4.1.2 Mandatory Conversion. All of the outstanding Series B-1
Preferred shall, without any further action by a holder thereof, convert into
Common (a "Series B-1 Mandatory Conversion") upon the first to occur
of the following (each a “Series B-1 Mandatory Conversion Event’): (A)
the Company's Qualified Public Offering, (B) at such time as at least two-
thirds of the aggregate number of shares of Series B Preferred and Series
B-1 Preferred, collectively, issued prior to such time have been voluntarily
converted into Common by the holders thereof, (C) at such time as is
specified in a vote or written consent of the holders of at least a majority of
the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred and Series B-1 Preferred,
voting together as a single class, on an as-converted basis, or (D) at such
time as is specified in a vote or written consent of the holders of at least the
Series D Approval Amount with respect to the conversion of all Preferred
into Common. In each case each share of Series B-1 Preferred shall be
automatically converted, without cost, on the terms of this Section 4.5.4,
into the number of shares of Common into which such share of Series B-1
Preferred would be convertible under Section 4.5.4.1.1 immediately prior to
such conversion.
4.5.4.2

HLG: 337197

-29-

4.5.4.1.3 Prior Pay to Play Conversions. Seventy-five percent (75%)
of any shares of Series B-1 Preferred issued after the Filing Date pursuant
to the Put Agreement shall immediately upon issuance convert into the
number of shares of Common into which such share of Series B-1
Preferred would be convertible under Section 4.4.4.1.1 immediately prior to
such conversion. Ail shares of Common issued to any holder of Series B-1
Preferred as a result of conversion pursuant to this Section 4.5.4.1.3 shall
be aggregated for the purpose of determining the number of shares of
Common to which such holder shall be entitled, and no fractional shares
shall'be issued in connection with such conversion. No cash in lieu of any
fractional share shall be paid to any stockholder as a result of conversion
pursuant to this Section 4.5.4.1.3.

Mechanics of Conversion.

4.5.4.2.1 Optional Conversion. A holder of any share of Series B-1
Preferred may exercise the Series B-1 Conversion Right of such share by
surrendering the certificate therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the
Company or of any transfer agent for the Series B-1 Preferred, together
with a written notice to the Company which states:

(A) that such holder elects to convert the same,

(B) the number of shares of Series B-1 Preferred being converted,
and

(C) the name or names in which such holder wishes the certificate or
certificates for shares of Common to be issued.

Thereupon the Company shail promptly issue and deliver to the holder of
such shares, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate
or certificates for the number of shares of Common to which such holder
shall be entitled. If the certificate evidencing the shares of Series B-1
Preferred being converted shall also evidence shares of Series B-1
Preferred not being converted, then the Company shall also deliver to the
holder of such certificate, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a
new stock certificate evidencing the Series B-1 Preferred not converted.
Any dividends or distributions declared but unpaid at the time of
conversion with respect to a share of Series B-1 Preferred so converted
shall be payable ratably to the holders of the Common issued upon such
conversion, pari passu with the payment of such dividends or distributions
payable pursuant to Section 4.4.4.2.1.

4.5.4.2.2 Mandatory Conversion. The Company shall give written notice
to each holder of a share of Series B-1 Preferred (A) not more than forty
(40) nor less than twenty (20) days before the anticipated effective date of
the registration statement with respect to any Qualified Public Offering, and
shall also give written notice to each such holder upon the occurrence of
any Qualified Public Offering; and (B) upon the occurrence of any other
Series B-1 Mandatory Conversion Event. Following the conversion of such
4.5.4.3

4.5.4.4

HLG: 337197

-30-

shares, each holder of shares so converted may surrender the certificate
therefor at the office of the Company or any transfer agent for the Series B-
1 Preferred. Upon such surrender, the Company shall issue and deliver to
each holder, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common to which such holder is
entitled. Any dividends or distributions declared but unpaid at the time of
conversion with respect to a share of Series B-1 Preferred so converted
shall be payable ratably to the holders of the Common issued upon such
conversion, pari passu with the payment of such dividends or distributions
payable pursuant to Section 4.4.4.2.2.

Effective Date of Conversion.

4.5.4.3.1. Optional Conversion. The conversion of any shares of Series B-
1 Preferred shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the
close of business on the date that the shares to be converted are
surrendered to the Company together with the notice required by Section
4.5.4.2.1, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of
Common issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes
as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common on such date.

4.5.4.3.2 Mandatory Conversion. The conversion of shares of Series B-1
Preferred shail take place upon the first to occur of the Series B-1
Mandatory Conversion Events, whether or not the certificates representing
such shares of Series B-1 Preferred shall have been surrendered, or new
certificates representing the shares of Common into which such shares
have been converted shall have been issued.

Adjustment of Conversion Price.

4.5.4.4.1 Subdivision or Combination of Shares. If the Company at any
time subdivides or combines the outstanding Common after the Filing Date,
the Series B-1 Conversion Price shall be decreased, in the case of a
subdivision, or increased, in the case of a combination, in the same
proportions as the Common is subdivided or combined, effective
automatically as of the date the Company shall take a record of the holders
of its Common for the purpose of the subdivision or combination (or if no
such record is taken, as of the effectiveness of the subdivision or
combination).

4.5.4.4.2 Stock Dividends. If the Company at any time pays a dividend, or
makes any other distribution, to holders of Common payable in shares of
Common, or fixes a record date for the determination of holders of
Common entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in
shares of Common, the Series B-1 Conversion Price shall be decreased by
multiplying it by a fraction:

(A) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of
Common outstanding immediately prior to such dividend or distribution,
and
TIT ct. 9397971079

-31-

(B) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of
Common outstanding immediately after such dividend or distribution
(plus, if the Company paid cash instead of fractional shares otherwise
issuable in such dividend or distribution, the number of additional shares
which would have been outstanding had the Company issued fractional
shares instead of cash),

effective automatically as of the date the Company shall take a record of
the holders of its Common for the purpose of receiving such dividend or
distribution (or if no such record is taken, as of the effectiveness of such
dividend or distribution).

4.5.4.4.3 Reclassification, Consolidation or Merger. If at any time, as a
result of:

(A) a capital reorganization or reclassification (other than a
subdivision, combination or dividend which gives rise to adjustment of the
Series B-1 Conversion Price pursuant to Sections 4.5.4.4.1 or 4.5.4.4.2),
or

(B) a merger or consolidation of the Company with another
corporation (whether or not the Company is the surviving corporation),

the Common issuable upon the conversion of the Series B-1 Preferred
shall be changed into or exchanged for the same or a different number of
shares of any class or classes of stock of the Company or any other
corporation, or other securities convertible into such shares, then, as a
part of such reorganization, reclassification, merger or consolidation,
appropriate adjustments shall be made in the terms of the Series B-1
Preferred {or of any securities into which the Series B-1 Preferred is
changed or for which the Series B-1 Preferred is exchanged), so that:

(X) the holders of Series B-1 Preferred or of such substitute securities
shall thereafter be entitled to receive, upon conversion of the Series B-1
Preferred or of such substitute securities, the kind and amount of shares
of stock, other securities, money and property which such holders would
have received at the time of such capital reorganization, reclassification,
merger, or consolidation, if such holders had converted their Series B-14
Preferred into Common immediately prior to such capital reorganization,
reclassification, merger, or consolidation, and

(Y) the Series B-1 Preferred or such substitute securities shall
thereafter be adjusted on terms as nearly equivalent as may be
practicable to the adjustments theretofore provided in this Section
4.5.4.4,
HLG: 337197

-32-

The provisions of this Section 4.5.4.4.3 shall similarly apply to successive
capital reorganizations, reclassifications, mergers, and consolidations.

4.5.4.4.4 Additional Shares of Common. If at any time the Company
issues (or is deemed by the express provisions of Section 4.3.4.4.5 to have
issued or sold) Additional Shares of Common without consideration or for a
consideration per share less than the lower of (i) the Series B-1 Conversion
Price in effect at such issuance or (ii) the Series C Conversion Price in
effect at such issuance, then the Series B-1 Conversion Price shall be
reduced, concurrently with such issuance, to a price (calculated to the
nearest cent) equal to the price determined by multiplying the Series B-1
Conversion Price by a fraction:

(A) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common
Outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Shares
of Common plus the number of shares of Common which the aggregate
consideration received (or by the express provisions hereof deemed to
have been received) by the Company for the total number of such
Additional Shares of Common so issued would purchase at the Series B-
1 Conversion Price, and

(B) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Outstanding immediately after the issuance of such Additional
Shares of Common;

provided, however, that in no event shall the Series B-1 Conversion Price
be reduced below $.01.

4.5.4.4.5 Convertibie Securities. For purposes of the adjustment required
under Section 4.5.4.4.4, Convertible Securities shall be treated as
described in Section 4.3.4.4.5.

4.5.4.4.6 Valuation of Consideration. The value of consideration received
by the Company for any issue or sale of securities shall be determined as
set forth in Section 4.3.4.4.6.

Preferred shall have the right (the "Series C Conversion Right"), at such
holder's option, to convert such share at any time, without cost and
otherwise on the terms of this Section 4.6.4, into the number of fully paid
and non-assessable shares of Common that results from dividing:

(A) $0.289018,
by:

(B) the Series C Conversion Price (as defined below) in effect at the
time of conversion.

The "Series C Conversion Price" as of the date of the Filing Date shall

provided in this Section 4.6.4.

4.6.4.1.2 Mandatory Conversion. All of the outstanding Series C
Preferred shall, without any further action by a holder thereof, convert into
Common (a "Series C Mandatory Conversion") upon the first to occur of
the following (each a “Series C Mandatory Conversion Event’): (A) the
Company's Qualified Public Offering, (B) at such time as at least 60% of the
aggregate number of shares of Series C Preferred issued prior to such time
have been voluntarily converted into Common by the holders thereof, (C) at
such time as is specified in a vote or written consent of the holders of at
least 60% of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred, or (D) at such
time as is specified in a vote or written consent of the holders of at least the
Series D Approval Amount with respect to the conversion of all Preferred
into Common. In each case each share of Series C Preferred shall be
automatically converted, without cost, on the terms of this Section 4.6.4,

shalt be issued in connection with such conversion. No cash in lieu of any

Mechanics of Conversion.

46.4.2.1 Optional Conversion. A holder of any share of Series C
Preferred may exercise the Series C Conversion Right of such share by
surrendering the certificate therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the
Company or of any transfer agent for the Series C Preferred, together with
a written notice to the Company which states:

(A) that such holder elects to convert the same,
(B) the number of shares of Series C Preferred being converted, and

(C) the name or names in which such holder wishes the certificate or
certificates for shares of Common to be issued.

Thereupon the Company shall promptly issue and deliver to the holder of
such shares, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate
or certificates for the number of shares of Common to which such holder
shall be entitled. If the certificate evidencing the shares of Series C
Preferred being converted shali also evidence shares of Series C
Preferred not being converted, then the Company shall also deliver to the
holder of such certificate, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a
new stock certificate evidencing the Series C Preferred not converted.
Any dividends or distributions declared but unpaid at the time of
conversion with respect to a share of Series C Preferred so converted
shall be payable ratably to the holders of the Common issued upon such
conversion.

4.6.4.2.2 Mandatory Conversion. The Company shall give written notice
to each holder of a share of Series C Preferred (A) not more than forty (40)
nor less than twenty (20) days before the anticipated effective date of the
registration statement with respect to any Qualified Public Offering, and
shall also give written notice to each such holder upon the occurrence of
any Qualified Public Offering; and (B) upon the occurrence of any other
Series C Mandatory Conversion Event. Following the conversion of such
shares, each holder of shares so converted may surrender the certificate
therefor at the office of the Company or any transfer agent for the Series C
Preferred. Upon such surrender, the Company shall issue and deliver to
each holder, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common to which such holder is
entitled. Any dividends or distributions declared but unpaid at the time of
conversion with respect to a share of Series C Preferred so converted shall
be payable ratably to the holders of the Common issued upon such
conversion.

Effective Date of Conversion.
4.6.4.3.1 Optional Conversion. The conversion of any shares of Series C

Preferred shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the
close of business on the date that the shares to be converted are
4.6.4.4

HLG: 337197

- 38 -

surrendered to the Company together with the notice required by Section
4.6.4.2.1, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of
Common issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes
as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common on such date.

4.6.4.3.2 Mandatory Conversion. The conversion of shares of Series C
Preferred shall take place upon the first to occur of the Series C Mandatory
Conversion Events, whether or not the certificates representing such
shares of Series C Preferred shall have been surrendered, or new
certificates representing the shares of Common into which such shares
have been converted shall have been issued.

Adjustment of Conversion Price.

4.6.4.4.1 Subdivision or Combination of Shares. If the Company at any
time subdivides or combines the outstanding Common after the Filing Date,
the Series C Conversion Price shall be decreased, in the case of a
subdivision, or increased, in the case of a combination, in the same
proportions as the Common is subdivided or combined, effective
automatically as of the date the Company shall take a record of the holders
of its Common for the purpose of the subdivision or combination (or if no
such record is taken, as of the effectiveness of the subdivision or
combination).

4.6.4.4.2 Stock Dividends. If the Company at any time pays a dividend, or
makes any other distribution, to holders of Common payable in shares of
Common, or fixes a record date for the determination of holders of
Common entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in
shares of Common, the Series C Conversion Price shall be decreased by
multiplying it by a fraction:

(A) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of
Common outstanding immediately prior to such dividend or distribution,
and

(B) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of
Common outstanding immediately after such dividend or distribution
(plus, if the Company paid cash instead of fractional shares otherwise
issuable in such dividend or distribution, the number of additional shares
which would have been outstanding had the Company issued fractional
shares instead of cash),

effective automatically as of the date the Company shall take a record of
the holders of its Common for the purpose of receiving such dividend or
distribution (or if no such record is taken, as of the effectiveness of such
dividend or distribution).

4.6.4.4.3 Reclassification, Consolidation or Merger. If at any time, as a
result of:
HAL GG): 337197

-39.-

(A) a capital reorganization or reclassification (other than a
subdivision, combination or dividend which gives rise to adjustment of the
Series C Conversion Price pursuant to Sections 4.6.4.4.1 or 4.6.4.4.2), or

(B) a merger or consolidation of the Company with another
corporation (whether or not the Company is the surviving corporation),

the Common issuable upon the conversion of the Series C Preferred shail
be changed into or exchanged for the same or a different number of
shares of any class or classes of stock of the Company or any other
corporation, or other securities convertible into such shares, then, as a
part of such reorganization, reclassification, merger or consolidation,
appropriate adjustments shall be made in the terms of the Series C
Preferred (or of any securities into which the Series C Preferred is
changed or for which the Series C Preferred is exchanged), so that:

(X) the holders of Series C Preferred or of such substitute securities
shall thereafter be entitled to receive, upon conversion of the Series C
Preferred or of such substitute securities, the kind and amount of shares
of stock, other securities, money and property which such holders would
have received at the time of such capital reorganization, reclassification,
merger, or consolidation, if such holders had converted their Series C
Preferred into Common immediately prior to such capital reorganization,
reclassification, merger, or consolidation, and

(Y) the Series C Preferred or such substitute securities shall
thereafter be adjusted on terms as nearly equivalent as may be
practicable to the adjustments theretofore provided in this Section 4.6.4.4.

The provisions of this Section 4.6.4.4.3 shall similarly apply to successive
capital reorganizations, reclassifications, mergers, and consolidations.

4.6.4.4.4 Additional Shares of Common. If at any time the Company
issues (or is deemed by the express provisions of Section 4.3.4.4.5 to have
issued or sold) Additional Shares of Common without consideration or for a
consideration per share less than the Series C Conversion Price in effect at
such issuance, then the Series C Conversion Price shall be reduced,
concurrently with such issuance, to a price (calculated to the nearest cent)
equal to the price determined by multiplying the Series C Conversion Price
by a fraction:

(A) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common
Outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Shares
of Common plus the number of shares of Common which the aggregate
consideration received (or by the express provisions hereof deemed to
have been received) by the Company for the total number of such
Additional Shares of Common so issued would purchase at the Series C
Conversion Price, and
- 40 -

(B) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Outstanding immediately after the issuance of such Additional
Shares of Common;

provided, however, that in no event shall the Series C Conversion Price
be reduced below $.01.

46.445 Convertible Securities. For purposes of the adjustment required
under Section 4.6.4.4.4, Convertible Securities shall be treated as
described in Section 4.3.4.4.5.

4.6.4.4.66 Valuation of Consideration. The value of consideration received
by the Company for any issue or sale of securities shall be determined as
set forth in Section 4.3.4.4.6.

4.6.4.4.7  Liquidating Dividends. Subject to the preferential rights of
holders of Series D Preferred pursuant to the provisions of Section
4.7.4.4.7, if the Company, at any time while any of the Series C Preferred is
outstanding, shall make a distribution of its assets to the holders of its
Common as a dividend in liquidation or partial liquidation or by way of
return of capital or other than as a dividend payable out of funds legally
available for dividends under the laws of the State of Delaware, the holders
of the Series C Preferred shall be entitled to receive, without payment of
any consideration therefor, the assets that would have been payable to
them as owners of that number of shares of Common receivable by
exercise of such Series C Conversion Rights, had they been the holders of
record of such Common on the record date for such distribution; and an
appropriate provision therefor shal! be made a part of any such distribution
in accordance with the preferential provisions of Section 4.6.3 of this
Restated Certificate.

4.6.4.5 Reservation of Shares. The Company will take such corporate action as
may be necessary from time to time so that at all times it will have authorized, and
reserved out of its authorized but unissued Common for the sole purpose of issuance
upon conversion of shares of Series C Preferred, a sufficient number of shares of
Common to permit the conversion in full of all outstanding shares of Series C
Preferred.

4.6.4.6 Full Consideration. All shares of Common which shail be issued upon the
conversion of any Series C Preferred will, upon issuance, be fully paid and non-
assessable. The Company will pay such amounts and will take such other action as
may be necessary from time to time so that all shares of Common which shall be
issued upon the exercise of the Series C Conversion Right of any Series C Preferred
will, upon issuance and without cost to the recipient, be free from all preemptive rights,
taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issue thereof.

certificate signed by its President or a Vice President and by its Chief Financial Officer,
Secretary or Assistant Secretary, setting forth, in reasonable detail, the event requiring
the adjustment, the amount of the adjustment, the method by which such adjustment
was calculated (including a description of the basis on which the Board of Directors
made any determination hereunder), and the Series C Conversion Price and the kind
of securities issuable upon the conversion of Series C Preferred after giving effect to
such adjustment.

Redemption.

4.6.5.1 "Redemption Trigger Date" has the meaning ascribed thereto in Section
4.3.5.1 above.

4.6.5.2 No share of Series C Preferred shall be redeemed under the provisions of
this Section 4.6.5 if there are shares of Series D Preferred outstanding at such time

certificates as the owner thereof, and each surrendered certificate shall be cancelled
and retired. If a certificate is surrendered and all the shares evidenced thereby cannot

company to pay, on or after the Series C Redemption Date, the Series C Redemption
Price to the respective holders of Series C Preferred upon the surrender of their share
certificates. From and after the date of such deposit, the shares so called for

be adjusted proportionately in the event the shares of Series D Preferred are
subdivided into a greater number or combined into a lesser number), plus (ii) an
amount equal to any dividends on such share which are declared but unpaid as of
such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company.

4.7.4.1 Terms of Conversion.

4.7.4.1.1 Optional Conversion. The holder of each share of Series D
Preferred shall have the right (the "Series D Conversion Right"), at such
hoider's option, to convert such share at any time, without cost and
otherwise on the terms of this Section 4.7.4, into the number of fully paid
and non-assessable shares of Common that results from dividing:

{A) the Series D Original Purchase Price,
by:

{B) the Series D Conversion Price (as defined below) in effect at the

be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in this Section
4.7.4.

4.7.4.1.2 Mandatory Conversion. All of the outstanding Series D
Preferred shall, without any further action by a holder thereof, convert into
Common (a "Series D Mandatory Conversion") upon the first to occur of

Company's Qualified Public Offering, (B) at such time as at least the Series
D Approval Amount issued prior to such time have been voluntarily
converted into Common by the holders thereof, (C) at such time as is
specified in a vote or written consent of the holders of at least the Series D
4.7.4.2

HLG: 337197

- 46 -

Approval Amount, or (D) at such time as is specified in a vote or written
consent of the holders of at least the Series D Approval Amount with
respect to the conversion of all Preferred into Common. In each case, each
share of Series D Preferred shall be automatically converted, without cost,
on the terms of this Section 4.7.4, into the number of shares of Common
into which such share of Series D Preferred would be convertible under
4.7.4.1.1 immediately prior to such conversion.

Mechanics of Conversion.

4.7.4.2.1 Optional Conversion. A holder of any share of Series D
Preferred may exercise the Series D Conversion Right of such share by
surrendering the certificate therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the
Company or of any transfer agent for the Series D Preferred, together with
a written notice to the Company which states:

(A) that such holder elects to convert the same,
(B) the number of shares of Series D Preferred being converted, and

(C) the name or names in which such holder wishes the certificate or
certificates for shares of Common to be issued.

Thereupon the Company shall promptly issue and deliver to the holder of
such shares, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate
or certificates for the number of shares of Common to which such holder
shall be entitled. If the certificate evidencing the shares of Series D
Preferred being converted shall also evidence shares of Series D
Preferred not being converted, then the Company shall also deliver to the
holder of such certificate, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a
new stock certificate evidencing the Series D Preferred not converted.
Any dividends or distributions declared but unpaid at the time of
conversion with respect to a share of Series D Preferred so converted
shall be payable ratably to the holders of the Common issued upon such
conversion.

4.7.4.2.2 Mandatory Conversion. The Company shall give written notice
to each holder of a share of Series D Preferred (A) not more than forty (40)
nor less than twenty (20) days before the anticipated effective date of the
registration statement with respect to any Qualified Public Offering, and
shall also give written notice to each such holder upon the occurrence of
any Qualified Public Offering; and (B) upon the occurrence of any other
Series D Mandatory Conversion Event. Following the conversion of such
shares, each holder of shares so converted may surrender the certificate
therefor at the office of the Company or any transfer agent for the Series D
Preferred. Upon such surrender, the Company shall issue and deliver to
each holder, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common to which such holder is
entitled. Any dividends or distributions declared but unpaid at the time of
conversion with respect to a share of Series D Preferred so converted shall
4.7.4.3

4.7.4.4

HLG: 337197

-47-

be payable ratably to the holders of the Common issued upon such
conversion.

Effective Date of Conversion.

4.7.4.3.1. Optional Conversion. The conversion of any shares of Series D
Preferred shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the
close of business on the date that the shares to be converted are
surrendered to the Company together with the notice required by Section
4.7.4.2.1, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of
Common issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes
as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common on such date.

4.7.4.3.2. Mandatory Conversion. The conversion of shares of Series D
Preferred shall take place upon the first to occur of the Series D Mandatory
Conversion Events, whether or not the certificates representing such
shares of Series D Preferred shall have been surrendered, or new
certificates representing the shares of Common into which such shares
have been converted shall have been issued.

Adjustment of Conversion Price.

4.7.4.4.1. Subdivision or Combination of Shares. If the Company at any
time subdivides or combines the outstanding Common after the Filing Date,
the Series D Conversion Price shall be decreased, in the case of a
subdivision, or increased, in the case of a combination, in the same
proportions as the Common is subdivided or combined, effective
automatically as of the date the Company shail take a record of the holders
of its Common for the purpose of the subdivision or combination (or if no
such record is taken, as of the effectiveness of the subdivision or
combination).

4.7.4.4.2 Stock Dividends. If the Company at any time pays a dividend, or
makes any other distribution, to holders of Common payable in shares of
Common, or fixes a record date for the determination of holders of
Common entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in
shares of Common, the Series D Conversion Price shall be decreased by
multiplying it by a fraction:

(A) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of
Common outstanding immediately prior to such dividend or distribution,
and

(B) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of
Common outstanding immediately after such dividend or distribution
(plus, if the Company paid cash instead of fractional shares otherwise
issuable in such dividend or distribution, the number of additional shares
which would have been outstanding had the Company issued fractional
shares instead of cash),
HLG: 337197

- 48 -

effective automatically as of the date the Company shall take a record of
the holders of its Common for the purpose of receiving such dividend or
distribution (or if no such record is taken, as of the effectiveness of such
dividend or distribution).

4.7.4.4.3 Reclassification, Consolidation or Merger. If at any time, as a
result of:

(A) a capital reorganization or reclassification (other than a
subdivision, combination or dividend which gives rise to adjustment of the
Series D Conversion Price pursuant to Sections 4.7.4.4.1 or 4.7.4.4.2), or

(B) a merger or consolidation of the Company with another
corporation (whether or not the Company is the surviving corporation),

the Common issuable upon the conversion of the Series D Preferred shall
be changed into or exchanged for the same or a different number of
shares of any class or classes of stock of the Company or any other
corporation, or other securities convertible into such shares, then, as a
part of such reorganization, reclassification, merger or consolidation,
appropriate adjustments shall be made in the terms of the Series D
Preferred (or of any securities into which the Series D Preferred is
changed or for which the Series D Preferred is exchanged), so that:

(X) the holders of Series D Preferred or of such substitute securities
shall thereafter be entitled to receive, upon conversion of the Series D
Preferred or of such substitute securities, the kind and amount of shares
of stock, other securities, money and property which such holders would
have received at the time of such capital reorganization, reclassification,
merger, or consolidation, if such holders had converted their Series D
Preferred into Common immediately prior to such capital reorganization,
reclassification, merger, or consolidation, and

(Y) the Series D Preferred or such substitute securities shall
thereafter be adjusted on terms as nearly equivalent as may be
practicable to the adjustments theretofore provided this Section 4.7.4.4.

The provisions of this Section 4.7.4.4.3 shall similarly apply to successive
capital reorganizations, reclassifications, mergers, and consolidations.

4.7.4.4.4 Additional Shares of Common.

(a) If at any time after the Filing Date until the earlier to occur of (i) the

three-year anniversary of the Initial Closing or (ii) the sale by the
Company of an aggregate of $50,000,000 in equity securities
(inclusive of the shares of Series D Preferred issued pursuant to the
Series D Purchase Agreement) (the earlier of (i) and (ii), the “Dilution
Lapse Date’), the Company issues (or is deemed by the express
provisions of Section 4.3.4.4.5 to have issued or sold) Additional
Shares of Common without consideration or for a consideration per
HLG: 337197

- 49 -

share less than the Series D Conversion Price in effect at such
issuance, then the Series D Conversion Price shall be reduced,
concurrently with such issuance, to a price equal to the consideration
per share of such Additional Shares of Common; provided, however,
that in no event shall the Series D Conversion Price be reduced below
$.01.

(b) If at any time after the Dilution Lapse Date, the Company issues (or is
deemed by the express provisions of Section 4.3.4.4.5 to have issued
or sold) Additional Shares of Common without consideration or for a
consideration per share less than the Series D Conversion Price in
effect at such issuance, then the Series D Conversion Price shail be
reduced, concurrently with such issuance, to a price (calculated to the
nearest cent) equal to the price determined by multiplying the Series
D Conversion Price by a fraction:

(A) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common
Outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Shares
of Common plus the number of shares of Common which the aggregate
consideration received (or by the express provisions hereof deemed to
have been received) by the Company for the total number of such
Additional Shares of Common so issued would purchase at the Series D
Conversion Price, and

(B) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Outstanding immediately after the issuance of such Additional
Shares of Common;

provided, however, that in no event shall the Series D Conversion Price
be reduced below $.01.

4.7.4.4.5 Convertible Securities. For purposes of the adjustment required
under Section 4.7.4.4.4, Convertible Securities shall be treated as
described in Section 4.3.4.4.5.

4.7.4.4.6 Valuation of Consideration. The value of consideration received
by the Company for any issue or sale of securities shall be determined as
set forth in Section 4.3.4.4.6.

4.7.4.4.7_ Liquidating Dividends. If the Company, at any time while any of
the Series D Preferred is outstanding, shall make a distribution of its assets
to the holders of its Common as a dividend in liquidation or partial
liquidation or by way of return of capital or other than as a dividend payable
out of funds legally available for dividends under the laws of the State of
Delaware, the holders of the Series D Preferred shall be entitled to receive,
without payment of any consideration therefor, the assets that would have
been payable to them as owners of that number of shares of Common
receivable by exercise of such Series D Conversion Rights, had they been
the holders of record of such Common on the record date for such
distribution; and an appropriate provision therefor shall be made a part of
4.7.5

- 50 -

any such distribution in accordance with the preferential provisions of
Section 4.7.3 of this Restated Certificate.

4.7.4.5 Reservation of Shares. The Company will take such corporate action as
may be necessary from time to time so that at all times it will have authorized, and
reserved out of its authorized but unissued Common for the sole purpose of issuance
upon conversion of shares of Series D Preferred, a sufficient number of shares of
Common to permit the conversion in full of all outstanding shares of Series D
Preferred.

4.746 Full Consideration. All shares of Common which shall be issued upon the
conversion of any Series D Preferred will, upon issuance, be fully paid and non-
assessable. The Company will pay such amounts and will take such other action as
may be necessary from time to time so that all shares of Common which shall be
issued upon the exercise of the Series D Conversion Right of any Series D Preferred
will, upon issuance and without cost to the recipient, be free from all preemptive rights,
taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issue thereof.

4.7.4.7 Notice of Adjustment Events. Whenever the Company contemplates the
occurrence of an event which would give rise to adjustments under Section 4.7.4.4, the
Company shall mail to each holder of Series D Preferred, at least 20 days prior to the
record date with respect to such event or, if no record date shall be established, at
least 20 days prior to such event, a notice specifying (i) the nature of the contemplated
event, and (ii) the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such
event, and (iii) the date on which such event is expected to become effective, and (iv)
the time, if any is to be fixed, when the holders of record of Common (or other
securities) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common {or other securities)
for securities or other property deliverable in connection with such event.

4.7.4.8 Notice of Adjustments. Whenever the Series D Conversion Price or the
kind of securities issuable upon the conversion of Series D Preferred, or both, shall be
adjusted pursuant to Section 4.7.4.4, the Company shall mail to each holder of Series
D Preferred, by first class mail postage prepaid, promptly after each adjustment, a
certificate signed by its President or a Vice President and by its Chief Financial Officer,
Secretary or Assistant Secretary, setting forth, in reasonable detail, the event requiring
the adjustment, the amount of the adjustment, the method by which such adjustment
was Calculated (including a description of the basis on which the Board of Directors
made any determination hereunder), and the Series D Conversion Price and the kind
of securities issuable upon the conversion of Series D Preferred after giving effect to
such adjustment.

4.3.5.1 above.

Original Purchase Price (such amount to be adjusted proportionately in the event the
shares of Series D Preferred are subdivided into a greater number or combined into a
lesser number) plus all declared but unpaid dividends on such shares (the "Series D
Redemption Price").

4.7.5.2.1 The Series D Redemption Notice shall state:

(a) that the holders of at least the Series D Approval Amount have

delivered to such person.

4.7.5.4 If the Series D Redemption Price is either paid or made available for
payment through the deposit arrangement specified in Section 4.7.5.5 with respect to
any shares of Series D Preferred, then notwithstanding that the certificates evidencing
any of the shares to be redeemed shal! not have been surrendered, all rights with

after the Series D Redemption Date, the Series D Redemption Price to the respective
holders of Series D Preferred upon the surrender of their share certificates. From and
after the date of such deposit, the shares so called for redemption shall be redeemed.
The deposit shall constitute full payment of the shares to their holders, and from and
after the Series D Redemption Date, the shares shall be deemed to be no longer
outstanding, and the holders thereof shall cease to be shareholders with respect
thereto and shall have no rights with respect thereto except the rights to receive from
the bank or trust company payment of the Series D Redemption Price of the shares,
without interest, upon surrender of their certificates therefor (and a certificate for those

year from such Series D Redemption Date shall be released or repaid to the
Company, after which the former holders of the shares called for redemption shall be
entitled to receive payment of the Series D Redemption Price with respect to such
shares only from the Company.

4.75.6 Ifthe funds of the Company legally available therefor shall be insufficient to
discharge the Series D Preferred redemption requirement in full, funds to the extent
legally available for such purpose shall be set aside upon the Company's receipt of a
Series D Redemption Election in accordance with Section 4.7.5.5. The maximum
number of full shares of Series D Preferred that can be redeemed with such funds
shall be redeemed from the holders of shares of Series D Preferred as of the date of

requested by such Related Party, be attributed to such holder; provided that no shares
constituting part of such excess shall be attributed to more than person or entity.

4.8.2.5 All shares of Common issued to any holder of Preferred as a result of
