notice, surrender such holder's certificate or certificates for all such shares to the Corporation at
the place designated in such notice, and shall thereafter reccive certificates for the number of
shares of Common Stock or other securities to which such holder is entitled. Upon the date of
any such automatic conversion, all rights with respect to the Convertible Preferred Stock will

shares), except only the rights of the holders thereof, upon surrender of their certificate or
certificates therefor, to recive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock or other
securities into which such Convertible Preferred Stock has been converted and cash for fractional
shares. All certificates evidencing shares of Convertible Preferred Stock which are automatically
converted in accordance with the provisions hereof shall, from and after the date of such
automatic conversion, be deemed to have been retired and canceled and the shares of Convertible
Preferred Stock represented thereby converted into Common Stock for all Purposes,
notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender such certificates. As soon
as practicable after the date of any such automatic conversion and the surrender of the certificate
or certificates for Convertible Preferred Stock as aforesaid, the Corporation shall cause to be
issued and delivered to such holder, or to such holder's written order, a certificate or certificates

shares of stock or other securities or property to which a holder of the number of shares
of Common Stock of the Corporation deliverable upon conversion of such Convertible
Preferred Stock would have been entitled upon such reclassification, reorganization,

the consideration actually received by the Corporation upon such exercise, plus the

Convertible Securities is less than the then-applicable Conversion Price in effect for such
series of Convertible Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall be deemed to have issued at
the time of the issuance of such Options the maximum number of Additional Shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the total amount of Convertible Securities .
covered by such Options and to have received as consideration for the issuance of such
Additional Shares of Common Stock an amount equal to the amount of consideration, if
