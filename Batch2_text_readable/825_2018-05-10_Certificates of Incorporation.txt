ARTICLES OF AMENDMENT UBI No: 601 973 642
OF
AVALARA, INC.

Pursuant to RCW 23B.10.060, the following Articles of Amendment are executed by
the undersigned, a Washington corporation:

1. The name of the corporation is Avalara, Inc. (the “Company’).

2. The Restated Fifteenth Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of the
Company are amended as follows:

(a) Section 2.2 of Article 2 of the Restated Fifteenth Amended and
Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company is amended to add the following
subsection 2.2.2:

“2.2.2 Reverse Stock Split. Upon effectiveness of these Articles of
Amendment (the “Effective Time”), every 2 outstanding shares of the
Company’s Common Stock shall be combined and reclassified into one share
of Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company, thereby
giving effect to a two-to-one reverse stock split (the “Reverse Split”). No
fractional shares shall be issued in the Reverse Split; instead, any shareholder
who would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share shall receive in lieu of
such fractional share a cash payment equal to the value of such fraction (based
on the per share value as determined by the Board of Directors in good faith).
The total number of shares which this Company is authorized to issue and the
total number shares of any class or series of shares that this Company shall
have authority to issue shall not be effected by the Reverse Split and shall
remain as set forth in Section 2.2.1. For the avoidance of doubt, the Reverse
Split will result in appropriate increases to the applicable Conversion Price (as
defined below) for each series of outstanding Series Preferred Stock (as
defined below) pursuant to Section 2.3.4(d)(3), but will not result in any other
adjustments to the Series Preferred Stock, including, without limitation, with
respect to references to numbers of Series Preferred Stock outstanding set
forth in these Amended Articles, or the Original Purchase Price or Liquidation
Value for any Series Preferred Stock. Each stock certificate that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented shares of the Company’s Common
Stock shall, from and after the Effective Time, be deemed exchanged for a
number of whole shares of Common Stock after the Effective Time into which
the shares of Common Stock formerly represented by such certificate shall
have been reclassified (as well as the right to receive cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Common Stock after the Effective Time), without the need for
surrender or exchange thereof.”

Securities Act, covering the sale of Common Stock to the public that results in
aggregate cash proceeds to the Company of not less than $50,000,000 (net of
