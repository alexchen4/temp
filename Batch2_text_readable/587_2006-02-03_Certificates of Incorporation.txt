The holders of the Series A-1 Preferred and the Series A-]A Preferred
shall have the following rights with respect to the conversion of the Series A-1 Preferred and the
Series A-1A Preferred into shares of Common Stock (the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Optional Conversion. Subject to and in compliance with the
provisions of this Section 5, any shares of Series A-! Preferred or Series A-1 A Preferred may, at
the option of the holder, be converted at any time into fully-paid and nonassessable shares of
Common Stock. The number of shares of Common Stock to which a holder of Series A-1
Preferred or Series A-1A Preferred shal] be entitled upon conversion shall be the product
obtained by multiplying the ‘Series A-1/A-1A Preferred Conversion Rate” then in effect
(determined as provided in Scction 5(b)) by the number of shares of Series A-1 Preferred or
Series A-1A Preferred, as the case may be, being converted.

(b) Series A-1/A-1A Preferred Conversion Rate. The conversion rate in
effect at any time for conversion of either the Series A-| Preferred or the Series A-1A Preferred
(the “Series A-1/A-1A Preferred Conversion Rate’) shall be the quotient obtained by dividing
the Original Issue Price of the Series A-1 Preferred or the Series A-1A Preferred, as the case may
be. by the “Series A-1/A-1A Preferred Conversion Price,” calculated as provided in Section 5(c).

(c) Series A-1/A-1A Preferred Conversion Price. The conversion price
for either the Series A-1 Preferred or the Series A-1A Preferred shall initially be the Original
Issue Price of cither the Series A-1 Preferred or the Series A-1A Preferred, as the case may be
(the “Series A-1/A-1A Preferred Conversion Price”). Such initial Series A-1/A-1A Preferred
Conversion Price shall be adjusted from time to time in accordance with this Section 5. All
references to the Series A-1/A-1A Preferred Conversion Price herein shall mean the Series A-
1/A-1A Preferred Conversion Price as so adjusted.

(d) Mechanics of Conversion, Esch holder of Series A-1 Preferred or
Series A-1A Preferred who desires to convert the same into shares of Common Stock pursuant to
this Section 5 shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of
the Company or any transfer agent for the Serics A-1 Preferred or the Series A-1A Preferred, and
shall give written notice to the Company at. such office that such holder elects to convert the
same. Such notice shall state the number of shares of Series A-1 Preferred and/or Series A-lA
Preferred being converted. Thereupon, the Company shall promptly issue and deliver at such
office to such holder a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to
which such holder is entitled and shall promptly pay (i) in cash or, to the extent sufficient funds
arc not then legally available therefor, in Common Stock (at the Common Stock’s fair market
value determined by the Board as of the date of such conversion), any declared and unpaid
dividends on the shares of Series A-1 Preferred and Series A-1A Preferred being converted and
(ii) in cash (at the Common Stock’s fair market valuc dctcrmincd by the Board as of the date of
conversion) the valuc of any fractional share of Common Stock otherwise issuable to any holder
of Serics A-1 Preferred or Series A-1A Preferred, as the case may be. Such conversion shall be
deemed to have been made at the close of business on the date of such surrender of the
certificates representing the shares of Series A-1 Preferred and Series A-IA Preferred to be

H-N: 176716.02
converted, and the person cntitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such

conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such shares of Common Stock
on such date.

(e) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If at any time or
from time to time afler the date that the first share of either Series A-1 Preferred or Series A-1A
Preferred is issued (as applicable, the “Original Issue Date’) the Company effects a subdivision
of the outstanding Common Stock, the Series A-1/A-1A Preferred Conversion Price in effect
immediately before that subdivision shall be proportionately decrcascd. Conversely, if at any
time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date the Company combines the outstanding
shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, the Series A-1/A-1A Preferred
Conversion Price in effect immediately before the combination shall be proportionately
increased. Any adjustment under this Section 5{e) shall become effective at the close of business
on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective.

(f) Adjustment for Common Stock Dividends and Distributions. If at
any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date the Company pays to holders of
Commion Stock a dividend or other distribution in additional shares of Common Stock, the Series
A-I/A-1A Preferred Conversion Price then in effect shall be decreased as of the time of such
issuance, as provided below:

(i) The Series A-1/A-1A Preferred Conversion Price shall be
adjusted by multiplying the Series A-1/A-1A Preferred Conversion Price then in effect by a
fraction equal to:

(A)the numerator of which is the total number of shares of
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance, and

(B) the denominator of which is the total number of shares
of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance plus the
number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution;

(ii) | If the Company fixes a record date to determine which
holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution, the Series
A-1/A-1A Preferred Conversion Price shall be fixed as of the close of business on such record
date and the number of shares of Common Stock shall be calculated immediately prior to the
close of business on such record date; and

(iii) If such record date is fixed and such dividend is not fully
paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the Series A-1/A-1A
Preferred Conversion Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such
record date and thereafter the Series A-1/A-1A Preferred Conversion Price shall be adjusted
pursuant to this Section 5(f) to reflect the actual payment of such dividend or distribution.

(g) Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange, Substitution,
Reorganization, Merger or Consolidation. If at any time or from time to time after the

H+M: 176716.02
Original Issue Date, the Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Series A-| Preferred
or the Series A-1A Preferred is changed into the same or a different number of shares of any
class or classes of stock, whether by recapitalization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or
otherwise (other than an Acquisition or Assel Transfer as defined in Section 4 or a subdivision or
combination of shares or stock dividend or a reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale of
asscts provided for elsewhere in this Section 5), in any such event each holder of Series A-1
Preferred and Series A-1A Preferred shall then have the right to convert such stock into the kind
and amount of stock and other securities and property receivable upon such recapitalization,
reclassification, merger, consolidation or other change by holders of the maximum number of
shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series A-1 Preferred or Series A-1A
Preferred could have been converted immediately prior to such recapitalization, reclassification,
merger, consolidation or change, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein or with
respect to such other securities or property by the terms thereof. In any su¢h case, appropriate
adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Scction 5 with respect to the
rights of the holders of cach of the Series A-! Preferred and the Series A-1A Preferred after the
capital reorganization to the end that the provisions of this Section 5 (including adjustment of the
Series A-1/A-1A Preferred Conversion Price then in effect and the number of shares issuable
upon conversion of cither the Serics A-1 Preferred or the Series A-1A Preferred) shall be
applicable after that event and be as nearly equivalent as practicable.

(h) Sale of Shares Below Series A-1/A-1A Preferred Conversion Price.

(i) If at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue
Date. the Company issues or sells, or is deemed by the express provisions of this Section 5(h) to
have issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock (as defined below), other than as
provided in Section 5(f) or 5(g) above, for an Effective Price (as defined below) less than the
then effective Series A-1/A-1A Preferred Conversion Price (a “Qualifying Dilutive Issuance”),
then and in each such case, the then existing Series A-1/A-1A Preferred Conversion Price shall
be reduced, as of the opening of business on the date of such issue or sale, to a price determined
by multiplying the Serics A-1/A-1A Preferred Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to
such issuance or sale by a fraction equal to:

(A)the numerator of which shall be (A) the number of
shares of Common Stock deemed outstanding (as determined below) immediately prior to such
issue or sale, plus (B) the number of shares of Common Stock which the Aggregate
Consideration (as defined below) received or deemed received by the Company for the total
number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued would purchase at such then-existing
Serics A-1/A-1A Preferred Conversion Price, and

(B) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares
of Common Stock deemed outstanding (as determined below) immediately prior to such issue or
sale plus the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued.

For the purposes of the preceding sentence, the number of shares of Common Stock

deemed to be outstanding as of a given date shall be the sum of (A) the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding, (B) the number of shares of Common Stock into which the then

WM: 176716.02
outstanding shares of Series A-1 Preferred could be converted if fully converted on the day
immediately preceding the given date, and (C) the number of shares of Common Stock into
which the then outstanding shares of Scries A-1A Preferred could be converted if fully converted
on the day immediately preceding the given date.

(ii) No adjustment shall be made to the Series A-I/A-I1A
Preferred Conversion Price in an amount less than one cent per share. Any adjustment otherwise
required by this Section 5(h) that is not required to be made due to the preceding sentence shal]
be included in any subsequent adjustment to the Serics A-1/A-1A Preferred Conversion Price.

(iii) | For the purpose of making any adjustment required under
this Section 5(h), the aggregate consideration received by the Company for any issue or salc of
securities (the “Aggregate Consideration”) shall be defined as: (A) to the extent it consists of
cash, be computed at the gross amount of cash received by the Company before deduction of any
underwriting or similar commissions, compensation or concessions paid or allowed by the
Company in connection with such issue or sale and without deduction of any expenses payable
by the Company, (B) to the extent it consists of property other than cash, be computed at the fair
value of that property as determined in good faith by the Board, and (C) if Additional Shares of
Common Stock, Convertible Securities (as defined below) or rights or options to purchase cither
Additional Shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities are issued or sold together with
other stock or securities or other assets of the Company for a consideration which covers both, be
computed as the portion of the consideration so reccived that may be reasonably determined in
good faith by the Board to be allocable to such Additional Shares of Common Stock, Convertible
Securities or rights or options.

(iv) For the purpose of the adjustment required under this
Section S(h), if the Company issues or sells (x) Preferred Stock or other stock, options, warrants,
purchase rights or other securitics convertible into, Additional Shares of Common Stock (such
convertible stock or securities being herein referred to as “Convertible Securities”) or (y) rights
or options for the purchase of Additional Shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities and
if the Effective Price of such Additional Shares of Common Stock is less than the Series A-1/A-
1A Preferred Conversion Price, in each case the Company shall be deemed to have issued at the
time of the issuance of such rights or options or Convertible Securities the maximum number of
Additional Shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise or conversion thereof and to have
received as consideration for the issuance of such shares an amount equal to the total amount of
the consideration, if any, received by the Company for the issuance of such rights or options or
Convertible Securities plus:

(A)in the case of such rights or options, the minimum

amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon the exercise of such rights or
options; and

(B) in the case of Convertible Securitics, the minimum
amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon the conversion thercof (other
than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities);
provided that if the minimum amounts of such consideration cannot be ascertained, but are a

H+M: 176716.02
function of antidilution or similar prolective clauses, the Company shall be deemed to have
received the minimum amounts of consideration without reference to such clauses.

(C) If the minimum amount of consideration payable to the
Company upon the exercise or conversion of rights, options or Convertible Securities is reduced
over time or op the occurrence or non-occurrence of specified events other than by reason of
antidilution adjustments. the Effective Price shall be recalculated using the figure to which such
minimum amount of consideration is reduced; provided further, that if the minimum amount of
consideration payable to the Company upon the exercise or conversion of such rights, options or
Convertible Securities is subsequently increased, the Effective Price shall be again recalculated
using the increased minimum amount of consideration payable to the Company upon the exercise
or conversion of such rights, options or Convertible Securities.

(D) No further adjustment of the Series A-1/A-1A Preferred
Conversion Price, as adjusted upon the issuance of such rights, options or Convertible Securities,
shall be made as a result of the actual issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock or the
exercise of any such rights or options or the conversion of any such Convertible Securities. If
any such rights or options or the conversion privilege represented by any such Convertible
Securities shall expire without having been exercised, the Series A-1/A-1A Preferred Conversion
Price as adjusted upon the issuance of such rights, options or Convertible Securities shall be
readjusted to the Series A-1/A-1A Preferred Conversion Price which would have been in effect
had an adjustment been made on the basis that the only Additional Shares of Common Stock so
issued were the Additional Shares of Common Stock, if any, actually issued or sold on the
exercise of such rights or options or rights of conversion of such Convertible Securities, and such
Additional Shares of Common Stock, if any, were issued or sold for the consideration actually
received by the Company upon such exercise, plus the consideration, if any, actually received by
the Company for the granting of all such rights or options, whether or not exercised, plus the
considcration received for issuing or selling the Convertible Securities actually converted, plus
the consideration, if any, actually received by the Company (other than by cancellation of
liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securitics) on the conversion of such
Convertible Securitics, provided that such readjustment shall not apply to prior conversions of
either Serics A-1 Preferred or Scrics A-1A Preferred.

(v) For the purpose of making any adjustment to the
Conversion Price of either the Series A-1 Preferred or the Series A-1A Preferred required under
this Scction 5(h), “Additional Shares of Common Stock” shall mean all shares of Common
Stock issued by the Company or deemed to be issued pursuant to this Section 5(h) (including
shares of Common Stock subsequently reacquired or retired by the Company) on or after the

number of shares of Additional Shares of Common Stock or the Effective Price cannot be
ascertained al the time of issuance, such Additional Shares of Common Stock shall be deemed
issued immediately upon the occurrence of the first event that makes such number of shares or
the Effective Price, as applicable, determinable.

(vi) In the event that the Company issues or sells, or is deemed
to have issued or sold, Additional shares of Common Stock in a Qualifying Dilutive [ssuance

transactions as the First Dilutive Issuance (a “Subsequent Dilutive Issuance”), then and in each
such case upon a Subsequent Dilutive Issuance the Series A-1/A-1A Preferred Conversion Price
shall be reduced to the Series A-1/A-1A Preferred Conversion Price that would have been in
effect had the First Dilutive Issuance and each Subsequent Dilutive Issuance all occurred on the
closing date of the First Dilutive Issuance.
