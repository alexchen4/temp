of any wholly unissued series of Preferred Stock, and the number of shares constituting any such series and the
designation thereof, or any of them; and to increase or decrease the number of shares of any series subsequent to the
issue of shares of that series, but not below the number of shares of such series then outstanding. In case the number
of shares of any series shall be so decreased, the shares constituting such decrease shall resume the status which they

a. Holders of Series E-F Preferred Stock, in preference to the holders of any other stock of the Company,
shall be entitled to receive, on an equal priority pari passu basis according to the respective dividend
preferences set forth herein when and as declared by the Board of Directors, but only out of funds that are
legally available therefor, cash dividends at the rate of eight percent (8%) of the "Original Issue Price" (as
defined below) per annum, on each outstanding share of Series E-F Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any
stock dividends, combinations, splits recapitalizations and the like with respect to such shares). After the
payment of dividends to holders of the Series E-F Preferred Stock, holders of the Series A-D Preferred
Stock, in preference to the holders of any other stock of the Company ("Junior Stock"), shall be entitled to
receive, on an equal priority pari passu basis according to the respective dividend preferences set forth
herein when and as declared by the Board of Directors, but only out of funds that are legally available
therefor, cash dividends at the rate of eight percent (8%) of the "Original Issue Price" (as defined below)
per annum, on each outstanding share of Series A-D Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any stock dividends,
combinations, splits recapitalizations and the like with respect to such shares). The "Original Issue Price"
of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be two dollars and fifty-three and six-tenths cents ($2.536). The

Series F Preferred Stock shall be $1.3077. Such dividends shall be payable only when, as and if declared by
the Board of Directors and shall be non-cumulative.

b. So long as any shares of the Series E-F Preferred Stock shall be outstanding, the Company shall not pay
or declare any dividend, whether in cash or property, or make any other distribution on the Series A-D
Preferred Stock, or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire for value any shares of the Series A-D Preferred
Stock until all dividends as set forth in Section 1(a) above on the Series E-F Preferred Stock shall have
been paid or declared and set apart. So long as any shares of Series Preferred shall be outstanding, no
dividend, whether in cash or property, shall be paid or declared, nor shall any other distribution be made,
on any Junior Stock, nor shall any shares of any Junior Stock of the Company be purchased, redeemed or
otherwise acquired for value by the Company (except for acquisitions of Common Stock by the Company
pursuant to agreements which permit the Company to repurchase such shares upon termination of services
to the Company or in exercise of the Company's right of first refusal upon a proposed transfer) until all
dividends (set forth in Section l(a) above) on the Series Preferred shall have been paid or declared and set
apart. In the event dividends are paid on any share of Common Stock, an additional dividend shall be paid
with respect to all outstanding shares of Series Preferred in an amount equal per share (on an as-if-
converted to Common Stock basis) to the amount paid or set aside for each share of Common Stock. The
provisions of this Section 1(b) shall not, however, apply to (i) a dividend payable in Common Stock, (ii) the
acquisition of shares of any Junior Stock in exchange for shares of any other Junior Stock, or (iii) any
repurchase of any outstanding securities of the Company that is approved by the Company's Board of
Directors.

manner as the Common Stock, in either case upon the following basis: each holder of shares of Series
Preferred shall be entitled to such number of votes as shall be equal to the whole number of shares of

3. LIQUIDATION RIGHTS.

a. Upon any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary,
before any distribution or payment shall be made to the holders of any other stock of the Company, the
holders of Series E-F Preferred Stock shall be entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Company, or the
consideration received in such transaction, on an equal priority pari passu basis according to the respective
liquidation preferences set forth herein, an amount per share equal to the sum of (i) one and one-half (1.5)
times the Original Issue Price of the Series E Preferred Stock, plus all declared and unpaid dividends on
such shares of Series E Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits,
recapitalizations and the like with respect to such shares other than the Split, as defined in Section D.4(c) of
this Article III) for each share of Series E Preferred Stock then held, and (ii) one (1) times the Original
Issue Price of the Series F Preferred Stock, plus all declared and unpaid dividends on such shares of Series
F Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like
with respect to such shares other than the Split, as defined in Section D.4(c) of this Article III) for each
share of Series F Preferred Stock then held (the "Series E-F Preference"). Upon any liquidation,
dissolution, or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, after payment in full of the
Series E-F Preference, but before any distribution or payment shall be made to the holders of any Junior
Stock, the holders of Series A-D Preferred Stock shall be entitled to be paid out of the assets of the
Company available for distribution, or

the consideration received in such transaction, if any, on an equal priority pari passu basis according to the
respective liquidation preferences set forth herein, an amount per share equal to the respective Original
Issue Prices of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock or Series D
Preferred Stock, plus all declared and unpaid dividends on such shares of Series A-D Preferred Stock (as
adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like with respect to such
shares other than the Split, as defined in Section D.4(c) of this Article III) for each share of Series A-D
Preferred Stock held by them (the "Series A-D Preference").

b. After the payment of the full Series E-F Preference and of the full Series A-D Preference as set forth in
Section 3(a) above, the remaining assets of the Company legally available for distribution, or the
consideration received in such transaction, if any, shall be distributed ratably to the holders of the Common
Stock and the Series Preferred (on an as-converted basis) until the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock,
the Series C Preferred Stock and the Series D Preferred Stock shall have received an aggregate per share
(including the amounts paid pursuant to Section 3(a) above) of three (3) times the Original Purchase Price
of each such share of Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock or Series D Preferred Stock, as
applicable. Thereafter, subject to the rights of the Preferred Stock that may from time to time come into
existence, the holders of the Common Stock, the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series E Preferred Stock and
the Series F Preferred Stock shall receive all of the remaining assets of the Company pro rata based upon
the number of shares of Common Stock, Series A Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock and Series F
Preferred Stock (each on an as-converted basis) held by each.

c. The following events shall be considered a liquidation under this Section 3:

(i) any consolidation or merger of the Company with or into any other corporation or other entity
or person, or any other corporate reorganization, in which the shareholders of the Company
immediately prior to such consolidation, merger or reorganization, own less than 50% of the
Company's voting power immediately after such consolidation, merger or reorganization, or any
transaction or series of related transactions to which the Company is a party in which in excess of
fifty percent (50%) of the Company's voting power is transferred (an " Acquisition"); and

(ii) a sale, exclusive license, lease or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company (an "Asset Transfer").

d. In the event that any transaction described in Section D.3(c) of this Article III occurs, if the consideration
received by this corporation is other than cash, its value will be deemed its fair market value as determined
in good faith by the Board of Directors. Any securities shall be valued as follows:

(i) Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar restrictions on free marketability
covered by (ii) below:
(A) If traded on a securities exchange or through the Nasdaq National Market, the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such quotation system over the
thirty (30) day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing;

(B) If actively traded over the counter, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing
bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the thirty (30) day period ending three (3) days
prior to the closing; and

(C) If there is no active public market, the value shall be the fair market value thereof, as
determined by the Board of Directors and the holders of a least a majority of the voting power of
all then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock.

5

(ii) The method of valuation of securities subject to investment letter or other restrictions on free
marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of a shareholder's status as an affiliate
or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount from the market value determined as
above in (A), (B) or (C) to reflect the approximate fair market value thereof, as determined by the
Board of Directors and the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then
outstanding shares of such Preferred Stock.

4. CONVERSION RIGHTS.

The holders of the Series Preferred shall have the following rights with respect to the conversion of the Series
Preferred into shares of Common Stock (the "Conversion Rights"):

a. Optional Conversion. Subject to and in compliance with the provisions of this Section 4, any shares of
Series Preferred may, at the option of the holder, be converted at any time into fully paid and nonassessable
shares of Common Stock. The number of shares of Common Stock to which a holder of Series Preferred
shall be entitled upon conversion shall be the product obtained by multiplying the "Series Preferred
Conversion Rate" then in effect for the applicable series of Preferred Stock (determined as provided in
Section 4(b)) by the number of shares of such series of Preferred Stock being converted.

b. Series Preferred Conversion Rate. The conversion rate in effect at any time for conversion of the
Series Preferred (the "Series Preferred Conversion Rate") shall be the quotient obtained by dividing the
Original Issue Price of the Series Preferred by the "Series Preferred Conversion Price," calculated as
provided in Section 4(c).

c. Conver sion Price. Upon the filing of these Restated Articles, the conversion price for the Series A
Preferred Stock shall be $0.634, the conversion price for the Series B Preferred Stock shall be $3.181074,
the conversion price for the Series C Preferred Stock shall be $3.955589, the conversion price for the Series
D Preferred Stock shall be $5.604556 and the conversion price for the Series E Preferred Stock and the
Series F Preferred Stock shall be each such series' respective Original Issue Prices (the conversion price for
each aforementioned series, the "Series Preferred Conversion Price"). For purposes of clarity, it is noted
that the conversion price of the Series A Preferred Stock gives effect to the four-for-one split of the
Company's Common Stock on August 17, 1998 (the "Split"). Such Series Preferred Conversion Prices shall
be adjusted from time to time in accordance with this Section 4. All references to the Series Preferred
Conversion Price herein shall mean the Series Preferred Conversion Price as so adjusted.
d. Mechanics of Conversion. Each holder of Series Preferred who desires to convert the same into shares
of Common Stock pursuant to this Section 4 shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly
endorsed, at the office of the Company or any transfer agent for the Series Preferred, and shall give written
notice to the Company at such office that such holder elects to convert the same. Such notice shall state the
number of shares of Series Preferred being converted. Thereupon, the Company shall promptly issue and
deliver at such office to such holder a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock
to which such holder is entitled and shall promptly pay in cash or, to the extent sufficient funds are not then
legally available therefor, in Common Stock (at the Common Stock's fair market value determined by the
Board of Directors as of the date of such conversion), any declared and unpaid dividends on the shares of
Series Preferred being converted. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made at the close of
business on the date of such surrender of the certificates representing the shares of Series Preferred to be
converted, and the person entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion
shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such shares of Common Stock on such date.

6

e. Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. For purposes hereof, the "Original Issue Date" for a
series of Preferred Stock is the effective date of the initial sale of shares of such series of Preferred Stock.
For purposes hereof, the "Filing Date" is the date of the filing of these Restated Articles. If the Company
shall at any time or from time to time after the Filing Date, effect a subdivision of the outstanding Common
Stock without a corresponding subdivision of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, the
Series C Preferred Stock, the Series D Preferred Stock, the Series E Preferred Stock and/or the Series F
Preferred Stock, the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price in effect immediately before that
subdivision shall be proportionately decreased. Conversely, if the Company shall at any time or from time
to time after the Filing Date combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of
shares without a corresponding proportional combination of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock, the Series C Preferred Stock, the Series D Preferred Stock, the Series E Preferred Stock
and/or the Series F Preferred Stock, the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price in effect immediately
before the combination shall be proportionately increased. Any adjustment under this Section 4(e) shall
become effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective.

f. Adjustment for Common Stock Dividends and Distributions. If the Company at any time or from
time to time after the Filing Date makes, or fixes a record date for the determination of holders of Common
Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock, in
each such event the Series Preferred Conversion Price that is then in effect for each series of Preferred
Stock shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance or, in the event such record date is fixed, as of the
close of business on such record date by multiplying the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price then
in effect by a fraction (i) the numerator of which is the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of business on such record date, and
(ii) the denominator of which is the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of business on such record date plus the issuance
of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution; provided, however, that if
such record date is fixed and such dividend is not fully paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the
date fixed therefor, the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of
the close of business on such record date and then thereafter such Series Preferred Conversion Price shall
be adjusted pursuant to this Section 4(f) to reflect the actual payment of such dividend or distribution.

g. Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. If at any time or from time to time after
the Filing Date, the Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Series Preferred is changed into the
same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by recapitalization,
reclassification or otherwise (other than an Acquisition or Asset Transfer as defined in Section 3(c) ora
subdivision or combination of shares or stock dividend or a reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale of
assets provided for elsewhere in this Section 4), in any such event each holder of Series Preferred shall
have the right thereafter to convert such stock into the kind and amount of stock and other securities and
property receivable upon such recapitalization, reclassification or other change by holders of the maximum
number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series Preferred could have been converted
immediately prior to such recapitalization, reclassification or change, all subject to further adjustment as
provided herein or with respect to such other securities or property by the terms thereof.

h. Reor ganizations, Mer gers, Consolidations or Sales of Assets. If at any time or from time to time after
the Filing Date, there is a capital reorganization of the Common Stock (other than an Acquisition or Asset
Transfer as defined in Section 3(c) or a recapitalization, subdivision, combination, reclassification,
exchange or substitution of shares provided for elsewhere in this

7

Section 4), as a part of such capital reorganization, provision shall be made so that the holders of the Series
Preferred shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of the Series Preferred the number of
shares of stock or other securities or property of the Company to which a holder of the number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable upon such conversion would have been entitled to receive as a result of such
capital reorganization, subject to adjustment in respect of such stock or securities by the terms thereof. In
any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 4
with respect to the rights of the holders of Series Preferred after the capital reorganization to the end that
the provisions of this Section 4 (including adjustment of the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price
then in effect and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Series Preferred) shall be applicable
after that event and be as nearly equivalent as practicable.

i. Sale of Shares Below Series Preferred Conversion Price.

(i) If, after the Filing Date the Company shall issue or sell, or is deemed by the express provisions
of this Section 4(i) to have issued or sold Additional Shares of Common Stock (as hereinafter
defined), other than in connection with a subdivision or combination of shares of Common Stock
as provided in Section 4(e) above, or a dividend or other distribution on any class of stock as
provided in Section 4(f) above, or a reclassification, exchange or substitution as provided in
Section 4(g) above, or a reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale of assets as provided in
Section 4(h) above, for an Effective Price (as defined in subsection (iv) below):

(A) less than the then effective Series Preferred Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred Stock,
then and in each such case the then Series Preferred Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred
Stock shall be reduced, as of the opening of business on the date of such issue or sale, to a price
determined by multiplying such Series Preferred Conversion Price by a fraction: (1) the numerator
of which shall be (A) the number of shares of Common Stock deemed outstanding (as determined
below) immediately prior to such issue or sale, plus (B) the number of shares of Common Stock
which the "aggregate consideration received" (as defined in subsection i(ii) below) by the
Company for the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued would purchase
at the then Series Preferred Conversion Price of the Series F Preferred Stock, and (ii), the
denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock deemed outstanding (as
determined below) immediately prior to such issue or sale plus the total number of Additional
Shares of Common Stock so issued; and/or

(B) less than the then effective Series Preferred Conversion Price for the Series E Preferred Stock,
then and in each such case the then Series Preferred Conversion Price for the Series E Preferred
Stock, shall be reduced, as of the opening of business on the date of such issue or sale, to a price
determined by multiplying such Series Preferred Conversion Price by a fraction: (1) the numerator
of which shall be (A) the number of shares of Common Stock deemed outstanding (as determined
below) immediately prior to such issue or sale, plus (B) the number of shares of Common Stock
which the "aggregate consideration received" (as defined in subsection i(ii) below) by the
Company for the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued would purchase
at the then Series Preferred Conversion Price of the Series E Preferred Stock, and (ii), the
denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock deemed outstanding (as
determined below) immediately prior to such issue or sale plus the total number of Additional
Shares of Common Stock so issued; and/or

(C) less than the then effective Series Preferred Conversion Price for the Series F Preferred Stock,
then and in each such case the then Series Preferred Conversion Price for the Series B Preferred
Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock and Series F Preferred Stock,
respectively, shall be reduced, as of the opening of business on the date of such issue or sale, to a
price determined by multiplying each such Series Preferred Conversion Price by a fraction: (i) the
numerator of which shall be (A) the number of shares of Common

Stock deemed outstanding (as determined below) immediately prior to such issue or sale, plus (B)
the number of shares of Common Stock which the "aggregate consideration received" (as defined
in subsection i(ii) below) by the Company for the total number of Additional Shares of Common
Stock so issued would purchase at the then Series Preferred Conversion Price of the Series F
Preferred Stock, and (ii), the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common
Stock deemed outstanding (as determined below) immediately prior to such issue or sale plus the
total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued.

For the purposes of this subsection 4(i)(i), the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be outstanding as of a
given date shall be the sum of (A) the number of shares of Common Stock actually outstanding, (B) the number of
shares of Common Stock into which the then outstanding shares of Series Preferred could be converted if fully
converted on the day immediately preceding the given date, and (C) the number of shares of Common Stock which
could be obtained through the exercise or conversion of all other rights, options and convertible securities
outstanding on the day immediately preceding the given date.

(ii) For the purpose of making any adjustment required under this Section 4(i), the "aggregate
consideration received" by the Company for any issue or sale of securities shall (A) to the extent it
consists of cash, be computed without deduction of any underwriting or similar commissions,
compensation or concessions paid or allowed by the Company in connection with such issue or
sale but without deduction of any expenses payable by the Company, (B) to the extent it consists
of property other than cash, be computed in accordance with Section 3(d) of this Article III.D., and
(C) if Additional Shares of Common Stock, Convertible Securities (as defined in subsection i(ii1)
below) or rights or options to purchase either Additional Shares of Common Stock or Convertible
Securities are issued or sold together with other stock or securities or other assets of the Company
for a consideration which covers both, be computed as the portion of the consideration so received
that may be reasonably determined in good faith by the Board of Directors to be allocable to such
Additional Shares of Common Stock, Convertible Securities or rights or options.

(iii) For the purpose of the adjustment required under this Section 4(i), if the Company issues or
sells any (i) stock or other securities convertible into, Additional Shares of Common Stock (such
convertible stock or securities being herein referred to as "Convertible Securities") or (ii) rights or
options for the purchase of Additional Shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities and if
the Effective Price of such Additional Shares of Common Stock is less than the applicable Series
Preferred Conversion Price, in each case the Company shall be deemed to have issued at the time
of the issuance of such rights or options or Convertible Securities the maximum number of
Additional Shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise or conversion thereof and to have
received as consideration for the issuance of such shares an amount equal to the total amount of
the consideration, if any, received by the Company for the issuance of such rights or options or
Convertible Securities, plus, in the case of such rights or options, the minimum amounts of
consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon the exercise of such rights or options, plus, in
the case of Convertible Securities, the minimum amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the
Company (other than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible
Securities) upon the conversion thereof; provided that if in the case of Convertible Securities the
minimum amounts of such consideration cannot be ascertained, but are a function of antidilution
or similar protective clauses, the Company shall be deemed to have received the minimum
amounts of consideration without reference to such clauses; provided further that if the minimum
amount of consideration payable to the Company upon the exercise or conversion of rights,
options or Convertible Securities is reduced over time or on the occurrence or non-occurrence of
specified events other than by reason of antidilution adjustments, the

9

Effective Price shall be calculated using the figure to which such minimum amount of
consideration is reduced; provided further that if the minimum amount of consideration payable to
the Company upon the exercise or conversion of such rights, options or Convertible Securities is
subsequently increased, the Effective Price shall be again recalculated using the increased
minimum amount of consideration payable to the Company upon the exercise or conversion of
such rights, options or Convertible Securities. No further adjustment of the Series Preferred
Conversion Price, as adjusted upon the issuance of such rights, options or Convertible Securities,
shall be made as a result of the actual issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock on the
exercise of any such rights or options or the conversion of any such Convertible Securities. If any
such rights or options or the conversion privilege represented by any such Convertible Securities
shall expire without having been exercised, the Series Preferred Conversion Price as adjusted upon
the issuance of such rights, options or Convertible Securities shall be readjusted to the Series
Preferred Conversion Price which would have been in effect had an adjustment been made on the
basis that the only Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued were the Additional Shares of
Common Stock, if any, actually issued or sold on the exercise of such rights or options or rights of
conversion of such Convertible Securities, and such Additional Shares of Common Stock, if any,
were issued or sold for the consideration actually received by the Company upon such exercise,
plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the Company for the granting of all such rights
or options, whether or not exercised, plus the consideration received for issuing or selling the
Convertible Securities actually converted, plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the
Company (other than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible
Securities) on the conversion of such Convertible Securities; provided that such readjustment shall
not apply to prior conversions of Series Preferred.

(iv) "Additional Shares of Common Stock" shall mean all shares of Common Stock issued by the
Company or deemed to be issued pursuant to this Section 4(i), whether or not subsequently
reacquired or retired by the Company other than (A) shares of Common Stock issued upon
conversion of the Series Preferred; (B) up to 6,940,000 shares of Common Stock and/or options,
warrants or other Common Stock purchase rights and the Common Stock issued pursuant to such
options, warrants or other rights (net of cancellations, repurchases and terminations and as
adjusted for stock dividends, combinations, splits other than the Split, recapitalizations and the
like) after the Original Issue Date of the Series A Preferred Stock to employees, officers or
directors of, or consultants or advisors to, the Company or any subsidiary pursuant to purchase or
stock option plans or other arrangements that are approved by the Board; (C) shares of Common
Stock issued pursuant to the exercise or conversion of options, warrants or convertible securities
outstanding as of the Filing Date; (D) up to 1,470,981 shares of Common Stock (including
options, warrants and rights to purchase Common Stock) issued to any bank, equipment lessor,
lender, financial institution or similar financing source, in bona fide arm's length transactions
primarily for non-capital raising purposes which are approved by the Board; (E) shares of
Common Stock (including options, warrants and rights to purchase Common Stock) issued in
connection with (1) any strategic acquisition or partnership relationship approved by the Board or
(2) a Qualified Initial Public Offering (as defined in Article III.D., Section 4()(i) below) or any
other registered public offering of the Company's securities in connection with which all then-
outstanding Preferred Stock is converted to Common Stock; and (F) any shares of Common Stock
or Preferred Stock (including options, warrants and rights to purchase Common Stock or Preferred
Stock) issued or issuable pursuant to transactions, agreements or other arrangements that are
approved by holders of a majority of the outstanding Series Preferred as being excluded from the
definition of "Additional Shares of Common Stock" set forth in this paragraph. Each holder of an
outstanding share of Series Preferred shall be

10

deemed to have consented, for purposes of Sections 502 and 503 of the California Corporations
Code, to distributions made by this Corporation in connection with the repurchase at cost (or such
other price as may be agreed to by this Corporation's Board of Directors) of shares of Common
Stock issued to or held by officers, directors or employees of, or consultants, contractors or
advisors to, this Corporation or its subsidiaries upon termination of their employment or services
pursuant to agreements (whether now existing or hereafter entered into) providing for the right of
said repurchase between this Corporation and such persons. References to Common Stock in the
subsections of this clause (iv) shall mean all shares of Common Stock issued by the Corporation
or deemed to be issued pursuant to this Section 4(i). The "Effective Price" of Additional Shares of
Common Stock shall mean the quotient determined by dividing the total number of Additional
Shares of Common Stock issued or sold, or deemed to have been issued or sold by the Company
under this Section 4(i), into the aggregate consideration received, or deemed to have been received
by the Company for such issue under this Section 4(4), for such Additional Shares of Common
Stock.

j. Certificate of Adjustment. In each case of an adjustment or readjustment of the Series Preferred
Conversion Price for the number of shares of Common Stock or other securities issuable upon conversion
of the Series Preferred, if the Series Preferred is then convertible pursuant to this Section 4, the Company,
at its expenses, shall compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the provisions hereof
and prepare a certificate showing such adjustment or readjustment and shall mail such certificate, by first
class mail, postage prepaid, to each registered holder of Series Preferred at the holder's address as shown in
the Company's books. The certificate shall set forth such adjustment or readjustment, showing in detail the
facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based, including a statement of (i) the consideration
received or deemed to be received by the Company for any Additional Shares of Common Stock issued or
sold or deemed to have been issued or sold, (ii) the Series Preferred Conversion Price at the time in effect,
(iii) the number of Additional Shares of Common Stock and (iv) the type and amount, if any, of other
property which at the time would be received upon conversion of the Series Preferred.

k. Notices of Record Date. Upon (i) any taking by the Company of a record of the holders of any class of
securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend or
other distribution, or (ii) any Acquisition (as defined in Section 3(c) or other capital reorganization of the
Company, any reclassification or recapitalization of the capital stock of the Company, any merger or
consolidation of the Company with or into any other corporation, or any Asset Transfer (as defined in
Section 3(c)), or any voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company, the
Company shall mail to each holder of Series Preferred at least twenty (20) days prior to the record date
specified therein a notice (the "Notice") specifying (A) the date on which any such record is to be taken for
the purpose of such dividend or distribution and a description of such dividend or distribution, (B) the date
on which any such Acquisition, reorganization, reclassification, transfer, consolidation, merger, Asset
Transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to become effective, and (C) the date, if any,
that is to be fixed as to when the holders of record of Common Stock (or other securities) shall be entitled
to exchange their shares of Common Stock (or other securities) for securities or other property deliverable
upon such Acquisition, reorganization, reclassification, transfer, consolidation, merger, Asset Transfer,
dissolution, liquidation or winding up; provided that the failure of the Company to timely give such notice
in the case of subsections (B) and (C) above shall not affect the validity of the events specified in such
subsections; provided, further, that in the event of a merger or reorganization of the Company for the
purpose of changing the Company's state of incorporation and in which there is no substantial change in the
shareholders of the Company or its successor (as the case may be), the above Notice shall be mailed to each
holder at least ten (10) days prior to such record date.

11

1. Automatic Conversion.

(i) Each share of Series Preferred shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock,
based on the then-effective, applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price, (A) at any time upon the
affirmative election of the holders of at least sixty-six and two thirds percent (667/3%) of the then
outstanding shares Series Preferred, voting together as a single class, or (B) immediately upon the
closing of a firmly underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, covering the offer and sale of Common Stock for
the account of the Company in which (i) the per share price is no less than $5.00 per share (as
adjusted for any stock splits, dividends, recapitalizations and the like occurring after the Filing
Date), and (ii) the aggregate cash proceeds to the Company (after underwriting discounts,
commissions and fees) are at least $20,000,000 (the "Qualified Initial Public Offering"). Upon
such automatic conversion, any declared and unpaid dividends shall be paid in accordance with
the provisions of Section 4(d).

(ii) Upon the occurrence of either of the events specified in paragraph (i) above, the outstanding
shares of Series Preferred shall be converted automatically without any further action by the
holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered
to the Company or its transfer agent; provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated
to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion unless
the certificates evidencing such shares of Series Preferred are either delivered to the Company or
its transfer agent as provided below, or the holder notifies the Company or its transfer agent that
such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the
Company to indemnify the Company from any loss incurred by it in connection with such
certificates. Upon the occurrence of such automatic conversion of the Series Preferred, the holders
of Series Preferred shall surrender the certificates representing such shares at the office of the
Company or any transfer agent for the Series Preferred. Thereupon, there shall be issued and
delivered to such holder promptly at such office and in its name as shown on such surrendered
certificate or certificates, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock
into which the shares of Series Preferred surrendered were convertible on the date on which such
automatic conversion occurred, and any declared and unpaid dividends shall be paid in accordance
with the provisions of Section 4(d).

m. Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of Series
Preferred. All shares of Common Stock (including fractions thereof) issuable upon conversion of more than
one share of Series Preferred by a holder thereof shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether
the conversion would result in the issuance of any fractional share. If, after the aforementioned aggregation,
the conversion would result in the issuance of any fractional share, the Company shall, in lieu of issuing
any fractional share, pay cash equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by the Common Stock's fair
market value (as determined by the Board of Directors) on the date of conversion.

n. Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Company shall at all times reserve and keep
available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the
conversion of the shares of the Series Preferred, such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from
time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of the Series Preferred. If at any
time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Series Preferred, the Company will take such corporate
action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of
Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.

12

o. Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Section 4 shall be in writing and shall be deemed
effectively given: (i) upon personal delivery to the party to be notified, (ii) when sent by confirmed telex or
facsimile if sent during normal business hours of the recipient; if not, then on the next business day, (iii)
five (5) days after having been sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage
prepaid, or (iv) one (1) day after deposit with a nationally recognized overnight courier, specifying next day
delivery, with written verification of receipt. All notices shall be addressed to each holder of record at the
address of such holder appearing on the books of the Company.

p. Payment of Taxes. The Company will pay all taxes (other than taxes based upon income) and other
governmental charges that may be imposed with respect to the issue or delivery of shares of Common
Stock upon conversion of shares of Series Preferred, including any tax or other charge imposed in
connection with any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other
than that in which the shares of Series Preferred so converted were registered.

q. No Dilution or Impairment. Without the consent of the holders of the then outstanding Series
Preferred, as required under Section 2, the Company shall not amend its Restated Articles of Incorporation
or participate in any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of
securities or take any other voluntary action, for the purpose of intentionally avoiding or seeking to avoid
the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Company,
but shall at all times in good faith assist in carrying out all such action as may be reasonably necessary or
appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holders of the Series Preferred against dilution or
other impairment.

5.REDEMPTION.

a. The Company shall be obligated to redeem the Series Preferred as follows:
(i) The holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (667/3%) of the then outstanding shares
of Series Preferred, voting together as a single class, may require the Company, to the extent it
may lawfully do so, to redeem the Series Preferred in one (1) installment on the fifth anniversary
of the Original Issue Date of the Series E Preferred (the "Redemption Date"). The Company shall
effect such redemption on the Redemption Date by (i) first paying in cash in exchange for the
shares of Series E-F Preferred Stock to be redeemed, on an equal priority pari passu basis and
prior and in preference to any redemption of the Series A-D Preferred Stock, a sum equal to the
Original Issue Price per share of the Series E-F Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any stock
dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like with respect to such shares) plus all
declared but unpaid dividends and plus ten percent (10%) of the Original Issue Price per annum
with respect to such shares (the "Series E-F Preferred Redemption Price"), and (ii) after payment
in full of the Series E-F Preferred Redemption Price, then paying in cash in exchange for the
shares of Series A-D Preferred Stock to be redeemed a sum equal to the Original Issue Price per
share of the Series A-D Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits,
recapitalizations and the like with respect to such shares) plus all declared but unpaid dividends
and plus ten percent (10%) of the Original Issue Price per annum with respect to such shares. The
total amount to be paid for the Series Preferred is hereinafter referred to as the "Redemption
Price." The Series E-F Preferred Stock shall be redeemed prior to redemption of any shares of
Series A-D Preferred Stock. Subject to the foregoing priority of the Series E-F Preferred Stock,
shares subject to redemption pursuant to this Section 5(a) shall be redeemed from each holder of
Series Preferred on an equal priority pro rata basis.

(ii) At least thirty (30) days but no more than sixty (60) days prior to the Redemption Date, the
Company shall send a notice (a "Redemption Notice") to all holders of Series

13

Preferred to be redeemed setting forth (A) the Redemption Price for the shares to be redeemed;
and (B) the place at which such holders may obtain payment of the Redemption Price upon
surrender of their share certificates. If the Company does not have sufficient funds legally
available to redeem all shares to be redeemed at the Redemption Date, then, subject to the
redemption priority of the Series E-F Preferred Stock set forth in subparagraph (a) above, it shall
redeem such shares pro rata (based on the portion of the aggregate Redemption Price payable to
them) to the extent possible and shall redeem the remaining shares to be redeemed as soon as
sufficient funds are legally available.

b. On or prior to the Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit the Redemption Price of all shares to be
redeemed with a bank or trust company having aggregate capital and surplus in excess of $100,000,000, as
a trust fund, with irrevocable instructions and authority to the bank or trust company to pay, on and after
such Redemption Date, the Redemption Price of the shares to their respective holders upon the surrender of
their share certificates. Any moneys deposited by the Company pursuant to this Section 5(b) for the
redemption of shares thereafter converted into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 4 hereof no
later than the fifth (Sth) day preceding the Redemption Date shall be returned to the Company forthwith
upon such conversion. The balance of any funds deposited by the Company pursuant to this Section 5(b)
remaining unclaimed at the expiration of one (1) year following such Redemption Date shall be returned to
the Company promptly upon its written request.

c. On or after the Redemption Date, each holder of shares of Series Preferred to be redeemed shall
surrender such holder's certificates representing such shares to the Company in the manner and at the place
designated in the Redemption Notice, and thereupon the Redemption Price of such shares shall be payable
to the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof and
each surrendered certificate shall be canceled. In the event less than all the shares represented by such
certificates are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares. From and
after the Redemption Date, unless there shall have been a default in payment of the Redemption Price or
the Company is unable to pay the Redemption Price due to not having sufficient legally available funds, all
rights of the holders of such shares as holders of Series Preferred (except the right to receive the
Redemption Price without interest upon surrender of their certificates), shall cease and terminate with
respect to such shares; provided that in the event that shares of Series Preferred are not redeemed due to a
default in payment by the Company or because the Company does not have sufficient legally available
funds, such shares of Series Preferred shall remain outstanding and shall be entitled to all of the rights and
preferences provided herein.

d. In the event of a call for redemption of any shares of Series Preferred, the Conversion Rights (as defined
in Section 4) for such Series Preferred shall terminate as to the shares designated for redemption at the
close of business on the fifth (Sth) day preceding the Redemption Date, unless default is made in payment
of the Redemption Price.

6. NO REISSUANCE OF SERIES PREFERRED.

No share or shares of Series Preferred acquired by the Company by reason of redemption, purchase, conversion or
otherwise shall be reissued; and in addition, the Restated Articles shall be appropriately amended to effect the
corresponding reduction in the Company's authorized stock.

IV.

A. The liability of the directors of the Corporation for monetary damages shall be eliminated to the fullest extent
permissible under California law.

14

B. The Corporation is authorized to provide indemnification of agents (as defined in Section 317 of the General
Corporation Law of California) for breach of duty to the Corporation and its shareholders through bylaw provisions
or through agreements with agents, or both, in excess of the indemnification otherwise permitted by Section 317 of
the General Corporation Law of California, subject to the limits on such excess indemnification set forth in Section
204 of the General Corporation Law of California. If, after the effective date of this Article, California law is
amended in a manner which permits a corporation to limit the monetary or other liability of its directors or to
authorize indemnification of, or advancement of such defense expenses to, its directors or other persons, in any such
case to a greater extent than is permitted on such effective date, the references in this Article to "California law"
shall to that extent be deemed to refer to California law as so amended.

C. Any repeal or modification of this Article shall only be prospective and shall not effect the rights under this
Article in effect at the time of the alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act giving rise to liability.

THREE: The foregoing amendment and restatement of the Articles of Incorporation has been duly approved by the
Board of Directors of this Corporation.

FOUR: The foregoing amendment and restatement of the Articles of Incorporation has been duly approved by the
required vote of shareholders in accordance with Sections 902 and 903 of the California Corporations Code. The
total number of outstanding shares of the Corporation is 9,278,280 shares of Common Stock, 1,042,184 shares of
Series A Preferred Stock, 4,178,273 shares of Series B Preferred Stock, 1,387,244 shares of Series C Preferred Stock
4,553,845 shares of Series D Preferred Stock and 4,653,318 shares of Series E Preferred Stock. The number of
shares of each class and each series voting in favor of the foregoing amendment and restatement of the Articles of
Incorporation equaled or exceeded the vote required. The percentage vote required was (i) more than 50% of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class, (ii) more than fifty
percent (50%) of the Common Stock, (iii) more than 50% of the Preferred Stock, (iv) more than 50% of the Series D
Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, (v) more than 50% of the Series E Preferred Stock, voting as a separate
class, (vi) more than 50% of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, and
Series D Preferred Stock, voting together as a separate class on an as-converted to Common Stock basis, (vii) more
than 50% of the Series B Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, (viii) more than 50% of the Series C Preferred
Stock, voting as a separate class, and (ix) more than 50% of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series E Preferred
Stock, voting together as a separate class on an as-converted to Common Stock basis.
