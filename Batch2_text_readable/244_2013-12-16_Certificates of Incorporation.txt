Change in Control,”

ce

(j) In the event of such a Change in Control, if the consideration reccived by
the Company or its stockholders is other than cash, the value of such non-cash consideration shall be
deemed its fair market value as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors as of the date of such
Change in Control. Any securities shall be valued as follows:
(i) Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar
restrictions on free marketability covered by Subsection D.4(j)(ii) below:

(A) If traded on a securities exchange or through the Nasdaq
National Market, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on
such quotation system over the thirty (30) day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing;

(B) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the thirty (30)
day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing; and

(C) If there is no active public market, the value shall be the
fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Board of Directors and the holders of at least
seventy percent (70%) of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (voting
together as a single class on an as-converted to Common Stock basis and not as a separate series).

(ii) The method of valuation of securities subject to investment letter
or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of a
stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount from the
market value determined as above in Subsection D.4(j)(i)(A), (B) or (C) to reflect the approximate fair
market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Board of Directors and the holders of at least seventy
percent (70%) of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of such Preferred Stock (voting together
as a single class on an as-converted to Common Stock basis and not as a separate series).

(k) Notwithstanding anything in this Section D.4 to the contrary, if upon any
liquidation event described in Section D.4(i), the holders of Preferred Stock would receive a greater
aggregate liquidation amount if such holders converted such holders’ shares of Preferred Stock into
Common Stock than such holders would be entitled to receive pursuant to Sections D.4(a)-(f) as holders
of Preferred Stock, then such holders shall not receive any amounts under such sections as holders of
Preferred Stock but shall be treated, for the purposes of determining such holders’ rights under such
sections only, as though such holders held, in addition to any shares of Common Stock then actually held
by such holders, such number of shares of Common Stock that such holders would hold if such holders
had then converted such holders’ shares of Preferred Stock into Common Stock, effective immediately
prior to such liquidation event, at the then applicable Conversion Rate for each series of Preferred Stock.
For the avoidance of doubt, however, in no event shall any holders of Preferred Stock be entitled to
receive under this Section D.4(k) both the liquidation preference set forth in Sections D.4(a)-(f) and any
distribution pursuant to the notional conversion described in this Section D.4(k).

The right of conversion with respect to any shares of Preferred Stock which shall have
been called for redemption under Section D.8 hereof shall terminate at the close of business on the day
fixed for redemption unless the Company shall default in the payment of the redemption price, in which
case the right of conversion with respect to such shares shall continue unless and until such redemption
price is paid in full.

(b) Mechanics of Optional Conversions. Before any holder of Preferred
Stock shall be entitled to convert shares of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, the holder shall
surrender the certificate or certificates therefor at the office of the Company or of any transfer agent for
the Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the Company at such office that the holder elects to
convert the same. Such notice shall state the number of shares of Preferred Stock being converted and
shall state therein the holder’s name or the name or names of the holder’s nominees in which the holder
wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued. On the date of conversion,
all rights with respect to the Preferred Stock so converted shall terminate, except any of the rights of the
holder thereof, upon surrender of the holder’s certificate or certificates therefor, to receive certificates for
the number of shares of Common Stock into which such Preferred Stock has been converted and cash in
an amount equal to any declared but unpaid dividends on, and any and all other amounts owing with
respect to, the shares of Preferred Stock being converted to and including the time of conversion. If so
required by the Company, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by
written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Company, duly executed by the
registered holder or by the holder’s attorney duly authorized in writing. Upon the optional conversion of
the Preferred Stock, all shares of Preferred Stock being converted by any holder thereof shall be
aggregated for the purpose of determining the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder
shall be entitled, and no fractional share of Common Stock shall be issued. In lieu of any fractional share

14
to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the Company shall pay cash equal to such fraction
multiplied by the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of conversion, as reasonably
determined by the Board of Directors in good faith. The Company shall, promptly after surrender of the
certificate or certificates for conversion, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock,
or to the holder's nominee or nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common
Stock to which the holder shall be entitled as aforesaid, together with cash in lieu of any fraction of a
share and cash in an amount equal to any dividends declared but unpaid thereon and any and all! other
amounts owing with respect thereto at such time. Unless otherwise specified by the holder in the written
notice of conversion, such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close
of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person
or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion shall be treated for
all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date.

(c) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall
automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the Applicable Conversion Price then in
effect, as the case may be, upon the occurrence of either of the following:

(i) at any time upon the affirmative election of the holders of at least
seventy-five percent (75%) of the outstanding shares of Series G Preferred Stock, Series F Preferred
Stock, Series E Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock and Series B and C Stock (voting together as if
a single class on an as-converted to Common Stock basis and not as separate series), or

(ii) immediately upon the closing of the Company’s first firm
commitment public offering underwritten by an investinent banking firm of national reputation pursuant
to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, covering the offer and
sale of Common Stock for the account of the Company at a price equal to or greater than three times (3x)
the Series G Conversion Price (as adjusted as provided herein) with aggregate gross procceds to the
Company of at least $40 million before expenses (“Qualified Public Offering”).

(d) Mechanics of Automatic Conversions. Upon the occurrence of an event
specified in Section 6(c), the shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically without any
further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates representing such shares
are surrendered to the Company or its transfer agent; provided, however, that all holders of shares of
Preferred Stock being converted shall be given written notice of the occurrence of the event specified in
Section 6(c) triggering such conversion, including the date such event occurred (the “Mandatory
Conversion Date’), and the Company shail not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion unless certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred
Stock being converted are either delivered to the Company or its transfer agent, or the holder notifies the
Company or any transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen, or destroyed and executes an
agreement satisfactory to the Company to indemnify the Company from any loss incurred by it in
connection therewith. On the Mandatory Conversion Date, all rights with respect to the shares of
Preferred Stock so converted shall terminate, except any of the rights of the holder thereof, upon
surrender of the holder’s certificate or certificates therefor, to receive certificates for the number of shares
of Common Stock into which such Preferred Stock has been converted, together with cash in an amount
equal to any declared but unpaid dividends on, and any and all other amounts owing with respect to, the
shares of Preferred Stock converted to and including the time of conversion. Upon the automatic
conversion of the shares of Preferred Stock, the holders of such shares shall surrender the certificates
representing such shares at the office of the Company or of its transfer agent. If so required by the
Company, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by written instrument
or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Company, duly executed by the registered holder or

15
by the holder’s attorney duly authorized in writing. Upon surrender of such certificates there shall be
issued and delivered to such holder, or to such holder’s nominee or nominees promptly at such office, a
certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Preferred
Stock surrendered were convertible on the date on which such automatic conversion occurred, together
with cash in an amount equal to any dividends declared but unpaid on, and any and all other amounts
owing with respect to, the shares of Preferred Stock converted to and including the time of conversion.
Upon the automatic conversion of the Preferred Stock, all shares of Preferred Stock being converted by
any holder thereof shall be aggregated for the purpose of determining the number of shares of Common
Stock to which such holder shall be entitled, and no fractional share of Common Stock shall be issued. In
lieu of any fractional share to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the Company shall pay cash
equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair market value of the Common Stock on the Mandatory
Conversion Date, as reasonably determined by the Board of Directors in good faith.

Additional Shares of Common Stock in Subsection D.6(e){i)(C)()) or Convertible Securities or shall fix
a record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive any such
Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of shares (as set forth in the instrument
relating thereto without regard to any provisions contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such
number) of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case of Convertible
Securities and Options therefor, the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, shall be
deemed to be Additional Shares of Common Stock issued as of the time of such issue or, in case such a
record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, and the Applicable
Conversion Price of such serics of Preferred Stock shall be adjusted accordingly, provided that in any
such case in which Additional Shares of Common Stock are deemed to be issued:

(1) no further adjustment in the Applicable
Conversion Price of any such series of Preferred Stock shal! be made upon the exercise of such Options or
conversion or exchange of the Convertible Securities,

(1) if such Options or Convertible Securitics by
their terms provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any increase in the consideration payable to
the Company, or decrease in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable, upon the exercise,
conversion or exchange thereof, the Applicable Conversion Price of any such series of Preferred Stock
computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto),
and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon any such increase or decrease becoming
effective, be recomputed to reflect such increase or decrease insofar as it affects such Options or the rights
of conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities;

(II) upon the expiration of any such Options or any
rights of conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have been exercised,
the Applicable Conversion Price of any such serics of Preferred Stock computed upon the original issue
thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments
based thereon, shall, upon such expiration, be recomputed as if

(1) In the case of Convertible Securities or
Options for Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common Stock issued were the shares of
Cominon Stock, if any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange
of such Convertible Securities and the consideration received therefor was the consideration actually
received by the Company for the issue of all such Options, whether or not exercised, plus the
consideration actually received by the Company upon such exercise, or for the issue of ali such
Convertible Securities which were actually converted or exchanged, plus the additional consideration, if
any, actually received by the Company upon such conversion or exchange; and

(2) in the case of Options for Convertible
Securities only the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were issued at
the time of issue of such Options, and the consideration reccived by the Company for the Additional
Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been then issued was the consideration actually received by the
Company for the issue of all such Options, whether or not exercised, plus the consideration deemed to

18
have been received by the Company (determined pursuant to Subsection 6(e)(v)) upon the issue of the
Convertible Securities with respect to which such Options were actually exercised;

(TV) no readjustment pursuant to clause (1) or (2)
immediately above shall have the effect of increasing the Applicable Conversion Price of any such series

Common Stock between the original adjustment date and such readjustment date; and

such record date shall be canceled as of the close of business on such record date, and thereafter the
Applicable Conversion Price of any such series of Preferred Stock shall be adjusted pursuant to this
Subsection 6(e)(iii) as of the actual date of their issuance.

(iv) Adjustment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional
Shares of Common Stock. If on or after the First Issuance Date the Company shall issue or sell, or is, in

Conversion Price, (B) in the casc of the Series F Preferred Stock, the Series F Conversion Price, (C) in the
case of the Series E Preferred Stock, the Series E Conversion Price, (D) in the case of the Series D
Preferred Stock, the Series D Conversion Price and (E) in the case of the Series C Preferred Stock, Series
B Preferred Stock or Series A Preferred Stock, the Series C Conversion Price in effect immediately prior
to the time of such issue or sale, then, forthwith upon such issue or sale, the Applicable Conversion Price
of a series of Preferred Stock shall be reduced concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the
nearest hundredth of a cent) determined by multiplying such applicable Conversion Price by a fraction,
the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
such issue plus the number of shares which the aggregate consideration received by the Company for the
total number of Additional Shares of Common so issued would purchase at such Conversion Price, and
the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior
to such issue plus the number of such Additional Shares of Common so issued or deemed to have been
issued. For the purposes of this Subsection D,6(e)(iv), all shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of ail outstanding shares of Preferred Stock and the exercise and/or conversion of any other
outstanding Convertible Securities and all outstanding Options shall be deemed to be outstanding.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any adjustment in Applicable Conversion
Prices hereunder, in the event that the percentage decrease in the Series A Conversion Price or the Series
B Conversion Price is greater than the percentage decrease in the Series C Conversion Price, then the
Series A Conversion Price or the Series B Conversion Price, as applicable, shall instead by adjusted by an
amount equal to the percentage decrease in the Series C Conversion Price.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of Subsection
D.6(e), the consideration received by the Company for the issue (or deemed issue) of any Additional
Shares of Common Stock shall be computed as follows:

(A) Cash and Property: Such consideration shall:

19
(Dd insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
aggregate amounts of cash received by the Company before deducting any reasonable discounts,
commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the Company for any underwriting, or
amounts paid or payable for accrued interest in connection with such issuance;

ret) insofar as it consists of property other than cash,
be computed at the fair value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors; and

(1) in the event Additional Shares of Common
Stock are issued together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Company for consideration
which covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in clauses
(I) and (ID above, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

{B} Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration
per share received by the Company for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued
pursuant to Subsection 6(e){iii)(A), relating to Options and Convertible Securities, shall be determined by
dividing (x) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Company as consideration for the issue
of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional
consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained
therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration) payable to the Company upon the exercise of
such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for
Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, by (y) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set
forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a
subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities.

(vi) Adjustment for Dividends, Distributions, Subdivisions,
Combinations or Consolidations of Common Stock.

(A) Stock Dividends, Distributions or Subdivisions. In the
event that at any time after the First Issuance Date, the Company shall effect payment of a pro rata stock
dividend, stock distribution or subdivision of the Common Stock, the Applicable Conversion Price of
each series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately before such deemed issuance shall, concurrently with
