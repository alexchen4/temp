4, Optional Conversion.

The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as follows (the
“Conversion Rights”):

4.1 Right to Convert.

4.1.1 Conversion Ratio. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be
convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time and from time to time, and without
the payment of additional consideration by the holder thereof, into such number of fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Series A Original Issue
Price by the Series A Conversion Price (as defined below) in effect at the time of conversion.
The “Series A Conversion Price” shall initially be equal to $2.00. Such initial Series A
Conversion Price, and the rate at which shares of Series A Preferred Stock may be converted into
shares of Common Stock, shall be subject to adjustment as provided below.

4.1.2 Termination of Conversion Rights. In the event of a notice of
redemption of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 6, the Conversion
Rights of the shares designated for redemption shal! terminate at the close of business on the last
full day preceding the date fixed for redemption, unless the redemption price is not fully paid on
such redemption date, in which case the Conversion Rights for such shares shall continue until
such price is paid in full. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation or a Deemed Liquidation Event, the Conversion Rights shall terminate at the close
of business on the last full day preceding the date fixed for the payment of any such amounts
distributable on such event to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock.

4.2 Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued
upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the
holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction
multiplied by the fair market value of a share of Common Stock as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors of the Corporation. Whether or not fractional shares would be issuable
upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Series A
Preferred Stock the holder is at the time converting into Common Stock and the aggregate
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion.

43 Mechanics of Conversion.

4.3.1 Notice of Conversion. In order for a holder of Series A Preferred
Stock to voluntarily convert shares of Series A Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock,
such holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates for such shares of Series A Preferred
Stock (or, if such registered holder alleges that such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed,
a lost certificate affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify
the Corporation against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the
alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate), at the office of the transfer agent for the
Series A Preferred Stock (or at the principal office of the Corporation if the Corporation serves
as its own transfer agent), together with written notice that such holder elects to convert all or
any number of the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock represented by such certificate or
certificates and, if applicable, any event on which such conversion is contingent. Such notice
shall state such holder’s name or the names of the nominees in which such holder wishes the
certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued. If required by the
Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by a
written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly
executed by the registered holder or his, her or its attorney duly authorized in writing. The close
of business on the date of receipt by the transfer agent (or by the Corporation if the Corporation
serves as its own transfer agent) of such certificates (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement)
and notice shall be the time of conversion (the “Conversion Time”), and the shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of the shares represented by such certificate shall be deemed to
be outstanding of record as of such date. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after the
Conversion Time, issue and deliver to such holder of Series A Preferred Stock, or to his, her or
its nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable
upon such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof, a certificate for the number (if
any) of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock represented by the surrendered certificate that
were not converted into Common Stock, and cash as provided in Subsection 4.2 in lieu of any
fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion.

43.2 Reservation of Shares. The Corporation shall at all times when the
Series A Preferred Stock shall be outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized
but unissued capital stock, for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Series A Preferred
Stock, such number of its duly authorized shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be
sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding Series A Preferred Stock; and if at any time
the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect
the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Corporation
shall take such corporate action as may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shal! be sufficient for such purposes,
including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval
of any necessary amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation. Before taking any action which
would cause an adjustment reducing the Series A Conversion Price below the then par value of
the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, the
Corporation will take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary

in order that the Corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of

Common Stock at such adjusted Series A Conversion Price.
4.3.3 Effect of Conversion. All shares of Series A Preferred Stock
which shall have been surrendered for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed
to be outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares shall immediately cease and terminate
at the Conversion Time, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive shares of Common
Stock in exchange therefor, with all unpaid Accruing Dividends, and any other declared but
unpaid dividends thereon, hereby cancelled and forfeited. Any shares of Series A Preferred
Stock so converted shall be retired and cancelled and may not be reissued as shares of such

series.

4.3.4 No Further Adjustment. Upon any such conversion, no adjustment
to the Series A Conversion Price shall be made for any declared but unpaid dividends on the
Series A Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion or on the Common Stock delivered upon
conversion,

4.3.5 Taxes. The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and other
similar taxes that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of Common
Stock upon conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4. The
Corporation shall not, however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of
any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other
than that in which the shares of Series A Preferred Stock so converted were registered, and no
such issuance or delivery shall be made unless and until the person or entity requesting such
issuance has paid to the Corporation the amount of any such tax or has established, to the
satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax has been paid.

(a) If the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the
Series A Original Issue Date shall issue any Options or Convertible Securities (excluding
Options or Convertible Securities which are themselves Exempted Securities) or shall fix a
record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive any such
Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set
forth in the instrument relating thereto, assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to
exercisability, convertibility or exchangeability but without regard to any provision contained
therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options
or, in the case of Convertible Securities and Options therefor, the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to be Additional Shares of Common Stock issued as of
the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of
business on such record date.

(b) ‘If the terms of any Option or Convertible Security, the
issuance of which resulted in an adjustment to the Series A Conversion Price pursuant to the
terms of Subsection 4.4.4 below, are revised as a result of an amendment to such terms or any
other adjustment pursuant to the provisions of such Option or Convertible Security (but

12

excluding automatic adjustments to such terms pursuant to anti-dilution or similar provisions of
such Option or Convertible Security) to provide for either (1) any increase or decrease in the
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion and/or exchange of
any such Option or Convertible Security or (2) any increase or decrease in the consideration
payable to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion and/or exchange, then, effective upon
such increase or decrease becoming effective, the Series A Conversion Price computed upon the
original issue of such Option or Convertible Security (or upon the occurrence of a record date
with respect thereto) shall be readjusted to such Series A Conversion Price as would have
obtained had such revised terms been in effect upon the original date of issuance of such Option
or Convertible Security. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no readjustment pursuant to this
clause (b) shall have the effect of increasing the Series A Conversion Price to an amount which
exceeds the lower of (i) the Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the original
adjustment made as a result of the issuance of such Option or Convertible Security, or (ii) the
Series A Conversion Price that would have resulted from any issuances of Additional Shares of
Common Stock (other than deemed issuances of Additional Shares of Common Stock as a result
of the issuance of such Option or Convertible Security) between the original adjustment date and
such readjustment date.

(c) If the terms of any Option or Convertible Security
(excluding Options or Convertible Securities which are themselves Exempted Secumnities), the
issuance of which did not result in an adjustment to the Series A Conversion Price pursuant to
the terms of Subsection 4.4.4 below (either because the consideration per share (determined
pursuant to Subsection 4.4.5 hereof) of the Additional Shares of Common Stock subject thereto
was equal to or greater than the Series A Conversion Price then in effect, or because such Option
or Convertible Security was issued before the Series A Original Issue Date), are revised after the
Series A Original Issue Date as a result of an amendment to such terms-or any other adjustment
pursuant to the provisions of such Option or Convertible Security (but excluding automatic
‘adjustments to such terms pursuant to anti-dilution or similar provisions of such Option or
Convertible Security) to provide for either (1) any increase or decrease in the number of shares
of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any such Option or
Convertible Security or (2) any increase or decrease in the consideration payable to the
Corporation upon such exercise, conversion or exchange, then such Option or Convertible
Security, as so amended or adjusted, and the Additional Shares of Common Stock subject thereto
(determined in the manner provided in Subsection C.4.4.3(a) above) shall be deemed to have
been issued effective upon such increase or decrease becoming effective.

({d)} Upon the expiration or termination of any unexercised
Option or unconverted or unexchanged Convertible Security (or portion thereof) which resulted
(either upon its original issuance or upon a revision of its terms) in an adjustment to the Series A
Conversion Price pursuant to the terms of Subsection 4.4.4 below, the Series A Conversion Price
shall be readjusted to such Series A Conversion Price as would have obtained had such Option or
Convertible Security (or portion thereof) never been issued.

(e) If the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
the exercise, conversion and/or exchange of any Option or Convertible Security, or the
consideration payable to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion and/or exchange, is
calculable at the time such Option or Convertible Security is issued or amended but is subject to

13

adjustment based upon subsequent events, any adjustment to the Series A Conversion Price
provided for in this Subsection 4.4.3 shall be effected at the time of such issuance or amendment
based on such number of shares or amount of consideration without regard to any provisions for
subsequent adjustments (and any subsequent adjustments shall be treated as provided in clauses
(b) and (c) of this Subsection 4.4.3. If the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the
exercise, conversion and/or exchange of any Option or Convertible Security, or the consideration
payable to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion and/or exchange, cannot be calculated
at all at the time such Option or Convertible Security is issued or amended, any adjustment to the
Series A Conversion Price that would result under the terms of this Subsection 4.4.3 at the time
of such issuance or amendment shall instead be effected at the time such number of shares and/or
amount of consideration is first calculable (even if subject to subsequent adjustments), assuming
for purposes of calculating such adjustment to the Series A Conversion Price that such issuance
or amendment took place at the time such calculation can first be made.

4.4.4 Adjustment of Series A Conversion Price Upon Issuance of

Additional Shares of Common Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the
Series A Original Issue Date : issue Additional Shares of Common Stock ree Additional

Shares“ of"Eomn ae tockedeemed=.to

considera jionsert i arg
fi€diately prior to “Sich ad Series A Conversion Price shall be reduced,
concurrently with such issue, to tice..(calculated to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent)
determined in accordance. wi ef6ll0\ : :

“CP) = CP; * (A+B) +(A+C).
For purposes of the foregoing formula, the following definitions shall apply:

(a) “CP,” shall mean the Series A Conversion Price in effect
immediately after such issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock

(b) “CP,” shall mean the Series A Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock;

(c) “A” shall mean the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock (treating for
this purpose as outstanding all shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Options
outstanding immediately prior to such issue or upon conversion or exchange of Convertible
Securities (including the Series A Preferred Stock) outstanding (assuming exercise of any
outstanding Options therefor) immediately prior to such issue);

(d)  “B” shall mean the number of shares of Common Stock
that would have been issued if such Additional Shares of Common Stock had been issued at a
price per share equal to CP) (determined by dividing the aggregate consideration received by the
Corporation in respect of such issue by CP}); and

(e) “C” shall mean the number of such Additional Shares of
Common Stock issued in such transaction.

14
4.4.5 Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this
Subsection 4.4, the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional
Shares of Common Stock shall be computed as follows:

(a) Cash and Property: Such consideration shall:

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

insofar as it consists of cash, be computed as the
aggregate amount of cash received by the
Corporation, excluding amounts paid or payable for
accrued interest;

insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair market value thereof at the
time of such issue, as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors of the Corporation; and

in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock
are issued together with other shares or securities or
other assets of the Corporation for consideration
which covers both, be the proportion of such
consideration so received, computed as provided in
clauses (i) and (ii) above, as determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

(b) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per
share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been

issued pursuant to Subsection 4.4.3, relating to Options and Convertible Securities, shall be

determined by dividing
(i)

(ii)

the total amount, if any, received or receivable by
the Corporation as consideration for the issue of
such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the
minimum aggregate amount of additional
consideration (as set forth in the instruments
relating thereto, without regard to any provision
contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of
such consideration) payable to the Corporation upon
the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the
case of Options for Convertible Securities, the
exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities
and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, by

the maximum number of shares of Common Stock

(as set forth in the instruments relating thereto,
without regard to any provision contained therein

15
for a subsequent adjustment of such number)
issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible
Securities, the exercise of such Options for
Convertible Securities and the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities.

44.6 Multiple Closing Dates. In the event the Corporation shall issue on
more than one date Additional Shares of Common Stock that are a part of one transaction or a
series of related transactions and that would result in an adjustment to the Series A Conversion
Price pursuant to the terms of Subsection 4.4.4 above, and such issuance dates occur within a
period of no more than 180 days from the first such issuance to the final such issuance, then,
upon the final such issuance, the Series A Conversion Price shall be readjusted to give effect to
all such issuances as if they occurred on the date of the first such issuance (and without giving
effect to any additional adjustments as a result of any such subsequent issuances within such
period).

4.5 Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If the Corporation shall at
any time or from time to time after the Series A Original Issue Date effect a subdivision of the
outstanding Common Stock, the Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately before that
subdivision shall be proportionately decreased so that the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be increased in proportion to such
increase in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. If the Corporation
shall at any time or from time to time after the Series A Original Issue Date combine the
outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately
before the combination shall be proportionately increased so that the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be decreased in
proportion to such decrease in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding.
Any adjustment under this subsection shal! become effective at the close of business on the date
the subdivision or combination becomes effective.

4.6 Adjustment for Certain Dividends and Distributions, In the event the
Corporation. at any time or from time to time after the Series A Original Issue Date shall make or

issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive,
a dividend or other distribution payable on the Common Stock in additional shares of Common
Stock, then and in each such event the Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately before
such event shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance or, in the event such a record date
shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, by multiplying the Series A
Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction:

(1) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares
of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the time of such issuance or the close of business
on such record date, and

16

(2) the denominator of which shall be the total number of
shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close
of business on such record date plus the number of shares
of Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or
distribution.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) if such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend is
not fully paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the Series A
Conversion Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record date
and thereafter the Series A Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this subsection as of
the time of actual payment of such dividends or distributions; and (b) that no such adjustment
shall be made if the holders of Series A Preferred Stock simultaneously receive a dividend or
other distribution of shares of Common Stock in a number equal to the number of shares of
Common Stock as they would have received if all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock
had been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event.

4.7 Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. In the event the

Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Series A Original Issue Date shall make or
issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive,
a dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the Corporation (other than a distribution
of shares of Common Stock in respect of outstanding shares of Common Stock) or in other
property and the provisions of Section 1 do not apply to such dividend or distribution, then and
in each such event provision shall be made so that the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock
' shall receive upon conversion thereof, in addition to the number of shares of Common Stock
receivable thereupon, the kind and amount of securities of the Corporation, cash or other
property which they would have been entitled to receive had the Series A Preferred Stock been
converted into Common Stock on the date of such event and had they thereafter, during the
period from the date of such event to and including the conversion date, retained such securities
receivable by them as aforesaid during such period, giving application to all adjustments called
for during such period under this paragraph with respect to the rights of the holders of the
Series A Preferred Stock; provided, however, that no such provision shall be made if the holders
of Series A Preferred Stock receive, simultaneously with the distribution to the holders of
Common Stock, a dividend or other distribution of such securities, cash or other property in an
amount equal to the amount of such securities, cash or other property as they would have
received if all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock had been converted into Common
Stock on the date of such event.

4.8 Adjustment for Merger or Reorganization, etc. Subject to the provisions

of Subsection 2.3, if there shall occur any reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
consolidation or merger involving the Corporation in which the Common Stock (but not the
Series A Preferred Stock) is converted into or exchanged for securities, cash or other property
(other than a transaction covered by Subsections 4.4, 4.6 or 4.7), then, following any such
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger, each share of Series A
Preferred Stock shall thereafter be convertible in lieu of the Common Stock into which it was
convertible prior to such event into the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property
which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation issuable upon

17
conversion of one share of Series A Preferred Stock immediately prior to such reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger would have been entitled to receive
pursuant to such transaction; and, in such case, appropriate adjustment (as determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation) shall be made in the application of the
provisions in this Section 4 with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the holders of the
Series A Preferred Stock, to the end that the provisions set forth in this Section 4 (including
provisions with respect to changes in and other adjustments of the Series A Conversion Price)
shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any securities or
other property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock.

readjustment of the Series A Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation at its
expense shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable but in any event not later than 10 days

furnish to each holder of Series A Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or
readjustment (including the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property into which the
Series A Preferred Stock is convertible) and showing in detail the facts upon which such
adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the written request at any time of any holder of Series A Preferred Stock (but in
any event not later than 10 days thereafter), furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a
certificate setting forth (i) the Series A Conversion Price then in effect, and (ii) the number of
shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other securities, cash or property which then
would be received upon the conversion of Series A Preferred Stock.

(a) the Corporation shall take a record of the holders of its
Common Stock (or other capital stock or securities at the time issuable upon conversion of the
Series A Preferred Stock) for the purpose of entitling or enabling them to receive any dividend or
other distribution, or to receive any right to subscribe for or purchase any shares of capital stock

for securities or other property deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification,

18

consolidation, merger, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, and the amount per share
