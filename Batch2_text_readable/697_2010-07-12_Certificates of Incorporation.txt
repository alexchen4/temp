dividing the Series B Original Issue Price by the Series B Conversion Price (as defined below) in
effect at the time of conversion. The “Series B Conversion Price” shall initially be equal to
$1.63074675. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of the
holder thereof, at any time and trom time to time, and without the payment of additional
consideration by the holder thereof, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Series A Original Issue Price by the Series A
Conversion Price (as defined below) in effect at the time of conversion. The “Series A
Conversion Price” shall initially be equal to $1.82744115. The “Applicable Conversion
Price” shall mean the Series C Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or the Series A
Conversion Price, as applicable. The initial Applicable Conversion Price, and the rate at which
shares of Preferred Stock may be converted into shares of Common Stock, shall be subject to
adjustment as provided below.

4.1.2 Termination of Conversion Rights. In the event of a notice of
redemption of any shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 7, the Conversion Rights of the
shares designated for redemption shall terminate at the close of business on the last full day
preceding the date fixed for redemption, unless the redemption price is not fully paid on such
redemption date, in which case the Conversion Rights for such shares shall continue until such
price is paid in full. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation or
a Deemed Liquidation Event, the Conversion Rights shall terminate at the close of business on
the last full day preceding the date fixed for the payment of any such amounts distributable on
such event to the holders of Preterred Stock.

4.2 Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued
upon conversion of the Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder
would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by
the fair market value of a share of Common Stock as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors. Whether or not fractional shares would be issuable upon such conversion shall be
determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock the holder is at the time
converting into Common Stock and the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issuable
upon such conversion.

4.3 Mechanics of Conversion.

4.3.1 Notice of Conversion. In order for a holder of Preferred Stock to
voluntarily convert shares of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall
surrender the certificate or certificates for such shares of Preferred Stock (or, if such registered
holder alleges that such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit
and agreement reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against
any claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or
destruction of such certificate), at the office of the transfer agent for the Preferred Stock (or at the
principal oftice of the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent), together

Il

with written notice that such holder elects to convert all or any number of the shares of the
Preferred Stock represented by such certificate or certificates and, if applicable, any event on
which such conversion is contingent. Such notice shall state such holder’s name or the names of
the nominees in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common
Stock to be issued. If required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall
be endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form
satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or his, her or its attorney
duly authorized in writing. The close of business on the date of receipt by the transfer agent (or
by the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent) of such certificates (or lost
certificate affidavit and agreement) and notice shall be the time of conversion (the “Conversion
Time’), and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the shares represented by
such certificate shall be deemed to be outstanding of record as of such date. The Corporation
shall, as soon as practicable after the Conversion Time, issue and deliver to such holder of
Preferred Stock, or to his, her or its nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of full
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion in accordance with the provisions
hereof, a certificate for the number (if any) of the shares of Preferred Stock represented by the
surrendered certificate that were not converted into Common Stock, and cash as provided in
Subsection 4.2 in lieu of any fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such
conversion.

4.3.2 Reservation of Shares. The Corporation shall at all times when the
Preferred Stock shall be outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but
unissued capital stock, for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Preferred Stock, such
number of its duly authorized shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to
effect the conversion of all outstanding Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall take such corporate
action as may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to
such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including, without limitation,
engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment
to the Certificate of Incorporation. Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment
reducing the Applicable Conversion Price below the then par value of the shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of the applicable series of Preferred Stock, the Corporation will
take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the
Corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock
at such adjusted Applicable Conversion Price.

4.3.3 Effect_of Conversion. All shares of Preferred Stock which shall
have been surrendered for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be
outstanding and all nights with respect to such shares shall immediately cease and terminate at
the Conversion Time, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive shares of Common
Stock in exchange therefor, with all unpaid Series A Accruing Dividends, Series B Accruing
Dividends or Series C Accruing Dividends, as applicable, and any other declared but unpaid
dividends thereon, hereby cancelled and forfeited. Any shares of Preferred Stock so converted
shall be retired and cancelled and may not be reissued as shares of such series.
4.3.4 No Further Adjustment. Upon any such conversion, no adjustment
to the Applicable Conversion Price shall be made for any declared but unpaid dividends on the
applicable series of Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion or on the Common Stock
delivered upon conversion.

4.3.5 Taxes. The Corporation shall pay any and al] issue and other
similar taxes that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of Common
Stock upon conversion of shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4. The Corporation
shall not, however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer
involved in the issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in
which the shares of Preferred Stock so converted were registered, and no such issuance or
delivery shall be made unless and until the person or entity requesting such issuance has paid to
the Corporation the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the
Corporation, that such tax has been paid.

(x) shares of Common Stock issued upon a Special
Mandatory Conversion (as defined below).

4.4.2 No Adjustment of the Applicable Conversion Pmce. No

the issuance or deemed issuance of such Additional Shares of Common Stock.

4.4.3. Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock.

(a) If the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the
Series C Original Issue Date shall issue any Options or Convertible Securities (excluding
Options or Convertible Securities which are themselves Exempted Securities) or shall fix a
record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive any such
Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set
forth in the instrument relating thereto, assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to
exercisability, convertibility or exchangeability but without regard to any provision contained
therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options
or, in the case of Convertible Securities and Options therefor. the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to be Additional Shares of Common Stock issued as of
the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of
business on such record date.

(b) ‘If the terms of any Option or Convertible Security, the
issuance of which resulted in an adjustment to the Applicable Conversion Price pursuant to the
terms of Subsection 4.4.4 below, are revised as a result of an amendment to such terms or any
other adjustment pursuant to the provisions of such Option or Convertible Security (but
excluding automatic adjustments to such terms pursuant to anti-dilution or similar provisions of
such Option or Convertible Security) to provide for either (1) any increase or decrease in the
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion and/or exchange of
any such Option or Convertible Security or (2) any increase or decrease in the consideration
payable to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion and/or exchange. then, effective upon
such increase or decrease becoming effective, the Applicable Conversion Price computed upon
the original issue of such Option or Convertible Security (or upon the occurrence of a record date
with respect thereto) shall be readjusted to such Applicable Conversion Price as would have
obtained had such revised terms been in effect upon the original date of issuance of such Option
or Convertible Security. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no readjustment pursuant to this
clause (b) shall have the effect of increasing the Applicable Conversion Price to an amount
which exceeds the lower of (i) the Applicable Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the
original adjustment made as a result of the issuance of such Option or Convertible Security, or
(ii) the Applicable Conversion Price that would have resulted from any issuances of Additional
Shares of Common Stock (other than deemed issuances of Additional Shares of Common Stock
as a result of the issuance of such Option or Convertible Security) between the omginal
adjustment date and such readjustment date.

15
(c) If the terms of any Option or Convertible Security
(excluding Options or Convertible Securities which are themselves Exempted Securities), the
issuance of which did not result in an adjustment to the Applicable Conversion Price pursuant to
the terms of Subsection 4.4.4 below (either because the consideration per share (determined
pursuant to Subsection 4.4.5 hereof) of the Additional Shares of Common Stock subject thereto
was equal to or greater than the Applicable Conversion Price then in effect, or because such
Option or Convertible Security was issued before the Series C Original Issue Date), are revised
after the Series C Original Issue Date as a result of an amendment to such terms or any other
adjustment pursuant to the provisions of such Option or Convertible Security (but excluding
automatic adjustments to such terms pursuant to anti-dilution or similar provisions of such
Option or Convertible Security) to provide for either (1) any increase or decrease in the number
of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any such
Option or Convertible Security or (2) any increase or decrease in the consideration payable to the
Corporation upon such exercise, conversion or exchange, then such Option or Convertible
Security, as so amended or adjusted, and the Additional Shares of Common Stock subject thereto
(determined in the manner provided in Subsection C.4.4.3(a) above) shall be deemed to have
been issued effective upon such increase or decrease becoming effective.

(d) Upon the expiration or termination of any unexercised
Option or unconverted or unexchanged Convertible Security (or portion thereof) which resulted
(either upon its original issuance or upon a revision of its terms) in an adjustment to the
Applicable Conversion Price pursuant to the terms of Subsection 4.4.4 below, the Applicable
Conversion Price shall be readjusted to such Applicable Conversion Price as would have
obtained had such Option or Convertible Security (or portion thereof) never been issued.

(e) If the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
the exercise, conversion and/or exchange of any Option or Convertible Security, or the
consideration payable to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion and/or exchange. 1s
calculable at the time such Option or Convertible Security is issued or amended but is subject to
adjustment based upon subsequent events, any adjustment to the Applicable Conversion Price
provided for in this Subsection 4.4.3 shall be effected at the time of such issuance or amendment
based on such number of shares or amount of consideration without regard to any provisions for
subsequent adjustments (and any subsequent adjustments shall be treated as provided in clauses
(b) and (c) of this Subsection 4.4.3). If the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
the exercise. conversion and/or exchange of any Option or Convertible Security, or the
consideration payable to the Corporation upon such exercise. conversion and/or exchange,
cannot be calculated at all at the time such Option or Convertible Security is issued or amended,
any adjustment to the Applicable Conversion Price that would result under the terms of this
Subsection 4.4.3 at the time of such issuance or amendment shall instead be effected at the time
such number of shares and/or amount of consideration is first calculable (even if subject to
subsequent adjustments), assuming for purposes of calculating such adjustment to the Applicable
Conversion Price that such issuance or amendment took place at the time such calculation can
first be made.

4.4.4 Adjustment_of Applicable Conversion Price Upon Issuance of
Additional Shares of Common Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the

Series C Original Issue Date issue Additional Shares of Common Stock (including Additional

16
Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to Subsection 4.4.3), without
consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Applicable Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such issue, then the Applicable Conversion Price shall be reduced,
concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent)
determined in accordance with the following formula:

CP. =CP, * (A+B) +(A+C).
For purposes of the foregoing formula, the following definitions shall apply:

(a) “CP,” shall mean the Applicable Conversion Price in effect
immediately after such issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock

(b) “CP,” shall mean the Applicable Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock;

(c) “A” shall mean the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock (treating for
this purpose as outstanding all shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Options
outstanding immediately prior to such issue or upon conversion or exchange of Convertible
Securities (including the Preferred Stock) outstanding (assuming exercise of any outstanding
Options theretor) immediately prior to such issue);

(d) “B” shall mean the number of shares of Common Stock
that would have been issued if such Additional Shares of Common Stock had been issued at a
price per share equal to CP, (determined by dividing the aggregate consideration received by the
Corporation in respect of such issue by CP); and

(e) “C” shall mean the number of such Additional Shares of
Common Stock issued in such transaction.

4.4.5 Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this
Subsection 4.4, the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional
Shares of Common Stock shall be computed as follows:

(a) Cash and Property: Such consideration shall:

(i) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed as the
aggregate amount of cash received by the
Corporation, excluding amounts paid or payable for
accrued interest;

(ii) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair market value thereof at the
time of such issue, as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors; and
(iii)

in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock
are issued together with other shares or securities or
other assets of the Corporation for consideration
which covers both, be the proportion of such
consideration so received, computed as provided in
clauses (i) and (ii) above, as determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors.

(b) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per
share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been
issued pursuant to Subsection 4.4.3, relating to Options and Convertible Securities, shall be

determined by dividing:

(3)

(ii)

the total amount, if any, received or receivable by
the Corporation as consideration for the issue of
such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the
minimum aggregate amount of additional
consideration (as set forth in the instruments
relating thereto, without regard to any provision
contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of
such consideration) payable to the Corporation upon
the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the
case of Options for Convertible Securities, the
exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities
and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, by

the maximum number of shares of Common Stock
(as set forth in the instruments relating thereto,
without regard to any provision contained therein
for a subsequent adjustment of such number)
issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible
Securities, the exercise of such Options for
Convertible Securities and the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities.

4.4.6 Multiple Closing Dates. In the event the Corporation shall issue on
more than one date Additional Shares of Common Stock that are a part of one transaction or a
series of related transactions and that would result in an adjustment to the Applicable Conversion
Price pursuant to the terms of Subsection 4.4.4 above, and such issuance dates occur within a
period of no more than 180 days from the first such issuance to the final such issuance, then,
upon the final such issuance, the Applicable Conversion Price shall be readjusted to give effect
to all such issuances as if they occurred on the date of the first such issuance (and without giving

18
effect to any additional adjustments as a result of any such subsequent issuances within such
period).

4.5 Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. Ifthe Corporation shall at
any time or from time to time after the Series C Original Issue Date effect a subdivision of the
outstanding Common Stock, the Applicable Conversion Price in effect immediately before that
subdivision shall be proportionately decreased so that the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be increased in proportion to such
increase in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. If the Corporation
shall at any time or from time to time after the Series C Original Issue Date combine the
outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Applicable Conversion Price in effect immediately
before the combination shall be proportionately increased so that the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be decreased in
proportion to such decrease in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding.
Any adjustment under this subsection shall become effective at the close of business on the date
the subdivision or combination becomes effective.

4.6 Adjustment_for Certain Dividends and Distributions. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Series C Original Issue Date shall make or

issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive,
a dividend or other distribution payable on the Common Stock in additional shares of Common
Stock, then and in each such event the Applicable Conversion Price in effect immediately before
such event shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance or, in the event such a record date
shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, by multiplying the
Applicable Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction:

(1) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares
of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior ta the time of such issuance or the close of business
on such record date, and

(2) the denominator of which shall be the total number of
shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close
of business on such record date plus the number of shares
of Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or
distribution.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) if such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend is
not fully paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the Applicable
Conversion Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record date
and thereafter the Applicable Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this subsection as of
the time of actual payment of such dividends or distributions; and (b) that no such adjustment
shall be made if the holders of Preferred Stock simultaneously receive a dividend or other
distribution of shares of Common Stock in a number equal to the number of shares of Common
Stock as they would have received if all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock had been
converted into Common Stock on the date of such event.

19

4.7. Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Series C Original Issue Date shall make or

issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive,
a dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the Corporation (other than a distribution
of shares of Common Stock in respect of outstanding shares of Common Stock) or in other
property and the provisions of Section | do not apply to such dividend or distribution, then and
in each such event provision shall be made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock shall
receive upon conversion thereof, in addition to the number of shares of Common Stock
receivable thereupon, the kind and amount of securities of the Corporation, cash or other
property which they would have been entitled to receive had the Preferred Stock been converted
into Common Stock on the date of such event and had they thereafter, during the period from the
date of such event to and including the conversion date, retained such securities receivable by
them as aforesaid during such period, giving application to all adjustments called for during such
period under this paragraph with respect to the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock;
provided, however, that no such provision shall be made if the holders of Preferred Stock
receive, simultaneously with the distribution to the holders of Common Stock, a dividend or
other distribution of such securities, cash or other property in an amount equal to the amount of
such securities, cash or other property as they would have received if all outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event.

4.8 Adjustment for Merger or Reorganization, etc. Subject to the provisions
of Subsection 2.3, if there shall occur any reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
consolidation or merger involving the Corporation in which the Common Stock (but not the
Preferred Stock) is converted into or exchanged for securities, cash or other property (other than
a transaction covered by Subsections 4.4, 4.6 or 4.7), then, following any such reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger, each share of Preferred Stock shall
thereafter be convertible in lieu of the Common Stock into which it was convertible prior to such
event into the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property which a holder of the number
of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation issuable upon conversion of one share of
Preferred Stock immediately prior to such reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
consolidation or merger would have been entitled to receive pursuant to such transaction; and, in
such case, appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) shall
be made in the application of the provisions in this Section 4 with respect to the rights and
interests thereafter of the holders of the Preferred Stock, to the end that the provisions set forth in
this Section 4 (including provisions with respect to changes in and other adjustments of the
Applicable Conversion Price) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in
relation to any securities or other property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of the
Preferred Stock.

49 Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Applicable Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation at its
expense shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable but in any event not later than 10 days
thereafter, compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and
furnish to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or
readjustment (including the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property into which the
Preferred Stock is convertible) and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or
readjustment is based. The Corporation shall. as promptly as reasonably practicable after the

20
written request at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock (but in any event not later than 10
days thereafter), furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a certificate sctting forth (i) the
Applicable Conversion Price then in effect, and (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock and
the amount, if any, of other securities, cash or property which then would be received upon the
conversion of Preferred Stock.

4.10 Notice of Record Date. In the event:

(a) the Corporation shall take a record of the holders of its
Common Stock (or other capital stock or securities at the time issuable upon conversion of the
Preferred Stock) for the purpose of entitling or enabling them to receive any dividend or other
distribution, or to receive any right to subscribe for or purchase any shares of capital stock of any
class or any other securities, or to receive any other security; or

(b) of any capital reorganization of the Corporation, any

Preferred Stock a notice specifying, as the case may be, (i) the record date for such dividend,
distribution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right, or (11)
the effective date on which such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer,
dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is proposed to take place, and the time, if any is to be
fixed, as of which the holders of record of Common Stock (or such other capital stock or
securities at the time issuable upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be entitled to
exchange their shares of Common Stock (or such other capital stock or securities) for securities
or other property deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger,
transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, and the amount per share and character of such
exchange applicable to the Preferred Stock and the Common Stock. Such notice shal] be sent at
least 10 days prior to the record date or effective date for the event specified in such notice.

5. Mandatory Conversion.

5.1 Trigger Events. Upon either (a) the closing of the sale of shares of
Common Stock to the public, in a firm-commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, with an offering
price per share equal to at least $4.00 (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock
dividend, stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization affecting such shares) and
resulting in at least $30 million of gross proceeds, before deduction of the underwnting discount
and commissions. to the Corporation or (b) the date and time, or the occurrence of an event,
specified by vote or written consent of the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock, voting together on an as-converted basis (the time of such closing or
the date and time specified or the time of the event specified in such vote or written consent is
referred to herein as the “Mandatory Conversion Time’), (i) all outstanding shares of Preferred
Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock, at the then effective
conversion rate, (ii) accrued but unpaid Series C Accruing Dividends, Series B Accruing
Dividends or Series A Accruing Dividends, as applicable, shall be paid in cash as provided in
Subsection 5.2, and (i1i) such shares may not be reissued by the Corporation.

5.2 Procedural Requirements. All holders of record of shares of Preferred
Stock shall be sent written notice of the Mandatory Conversion Time and the place designated
for mandatory conversion of all such shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 5. Such
notice need not be sent in advance of the occurrence of the Mandatory Conversion Time. Upon
receipt of such notice, each holder of shares of Preferred Stock shall surrender his, her or its
certificate or certificates for all such shares (or, if such holder alleges that such certificate has
been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to
the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made against the
Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate) to the
Corporation at the place designated in such notice, and shall thereafter receive certificates for the
number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Section 5.
At the Mandatory Conversion Time, all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to
have been converted into shares of Common Stock, which shall be deemed to be outstanding of
record, and all rights with respect to the Preferred Stock so converted, including the rights, if
any, to receive notices and vote (other than as a holder of Common Stock), will terminate, except
only the rights of the holders thereof, upon surrender of their certificate or certificates (or lost
certificate affidavit and agreement) therefor, to receive the items provided for in the last sentence

satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or by his, her or its
attorney duly authorized in writing. As soon as practicable after the Mandatory Conversion
Time and the surrender of the certificate or certificates (or lost certificate affidavit and
agreement) for Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall issue and deliver to such holder, or to his,
her or its nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock
issuable on such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof, together with cash as
provided in Subsection 4.2 in Jieu of any fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable

such series of Preferred Stock into which such securities are convertible, exercisable or

Purchaser, shall automatically, and without any further action on the part of such holder, be
converted into shares, or the right to receive shares, of Common Stock at a rate of 10 to 1, such

outstanding immediately prior to the Initial Closing, Second Closing or Third Closing, as

outstanding Preferred Stock Instruments, for each 10 shares of Preferred Stock into which such
Preferred Stock Instruments are convertible, exchangeable or exercisable immediately prior to
the Initial Closing, Second Closing or Third Closing, as applicable, such Preferred Stock
Instruments shall be converted into the right to receive | share of Common Stock upon such
conversion, exchange or exercise, effective upon, subject to, and concurrently with the Initial

vote (other than as a holder of Common Stock), will terminate, except only the rights of the
holders thereof, upon surrender of their certificates or instruments therefor (or affidavit and
indemnity agreement), to receive the items provided for in the last sentence of this Subsection
6.2. If so required by the Corporation, certificates and instruments surrendered for conversion
shall be endorsed or accompanied by written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form
satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or by his, her or its
attorney duly authorized in writing. As soon as practicable after the Special Mandatory

rights with respect to such Preferred Stock shall immediately cease and terminate at the time of
the Special Mandatory Conversion, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive shares
of (or the right to receive shares of) Common Stock in exchange therefor and to receive payment
of any dividends declared but unpaid thereon, if applicable. Any shares of Preferred Stock or
Preterred Stock Instruments that are converted pursuant to a Special Mandatory Conversion shall

prior to such Redemption Date by (11) the number of remaining Redemption Dates (including the
Redemption Date to which such calculation applies). If the Corporation does not have sufficient
funds legally available to redeem on any Redemption Date all shares of Preferred Stock to be

registered holder alleges that such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate
affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation
against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft
or destruction of such certificate) to the Corporation, in the manner and at the place designated in
the Redemption Notice, and thereupon the Applicable Redemption Price for such shares shall be
payable to the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the
owner thereof. In the event less than all of the shares of the applicable series of Preferred Stock
represented by a certificate are redeemed, a new certificate representing the unredeemed shares
of such series of Preferred Stock shall promptly be issued to such holder.

7.4 Rights Subsequent to Redemption. If the Redemption Notice shall have
been duly given, and if on the applicable Redemption Date the Applicable Redemption Price
payable upon redemption of the shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such Redemption
Date is paid or tendered for payment or deposited with an independent payment agent so as to be
available therefor, then notwithstanding that the certificates evidencing any of the shares of
Preferred Stock so called for redemption shal] not have been surrendered, dividends with respect
to such shares of Preferred Stock shall cease to accrue after such Redemption Date and all rights
