24185/00019/D0CS/1623425.4
2.1 Dividend Preference. In each calendar year, the holders of the then
outstanding Series CC Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the
Board, out of any funds and assets of the Company legally available therefor, noncumulative
dividends at the annual Dividend Rate for the Series CC Preferred Stock, prior and in preference
to the payment of any dividends or other Distribution on the Series AA Preferred Stock, Series
BB Preferred Stock or the Common Stock in such calendar year (other than a Common Stock
Dividend). Subject to the prior dividend preference of the Series CC Preferred Stock, in each
calendar year, the holders of the then outstanding Series BB Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
receive, when, as and if declared by the Board, out of any funds and assets of the Company
legally available therefor, noncumulative dividends at the annual Dividend Rate for the Series
BB Preferred Stock, prior and in preference to the payment of any dividends or other Distribution
on the Series AA Preferred Stock or the Common Stock in such calendar year (other than a
Common Stock Dividend). Subject to the prior dividend preference of the Series CC Preferred
Stock and the Series BB Preferred Stock, in each calendar year, the holders of the then
outstanding Series AA Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by
the Board, out of any funds and assets of the Company legally available therefor, noncumulative
dividends at the annual Dividend Rate for the Series AA Preferred Stock, prior and in preference
to the payment of any dividends or other Distribution on the Common Stock in such calendar
year (other than a Common Stock Dividend). Dividends on the Preferred Stock shall not be
mandatory or cumulative, and no rights or interest shall accrue to the holders of any series of
Preferred Stock by reason of the fact that the Company shall fail to declare or pay dividends on
any series of the Preferred Stock in the amount of the respective annual Dividend Rate for such
series or in any other amount in any calendar year or any fiscal year of the Company, whether or
not the earnings of the Company in any calendar year or fiscal year were sufficient to pay such
dividends in whole or in part.

2.2 Common Stock Dividend. If, after dividends in the full preferential
amounts specified in this Section 2 for each series of the Preferred Stock have been paid or
declared and set apart in any calendar year of the Company, the Board declares additional
dividends out of funds legally available therefor in that calendar year, then such additional
dividends shall be declared pro rata on the Common Stock.

2.3 Non-Cash Dividends. Whenever a dividend or Distribution provided for
in this Section 2 shall be payable in property other than cash, the value of such dividend or
Distribution shall be deemed to be the fair market value of such property as determined in good
faith by the Board.

3. Liquidation Rights. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of
the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, the funds and assets of the Company that may be
legally distributed to the Company's stockholders (the "Available Funds and Assets") shall be
distributed to stockholders in the following manner:

3.1 Liquidation Preferences.

(a) Series CC Preferred Stock. The holders of each share of Series CC
Preferred Stock then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid, out of the Available Funds and

-4-
24185/00019/DO0CS/1623425.4
Assets, and prior and in preference to any payment or distribution (or any setting apart of any
payment or distribution) of any Available Funds and Assets on any shares of Series BB Preferred
Stock, Series AA Preferred Stock or Common Stock, an amount per share equal to the Original
Issue Price for the Series CC Preferred Stock, plus all declared but unpaid dividends thereon. If
upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company the Available Funds and Assets
shall be insufficient to permit the payment to holders of the Series CC Preferred Stock of their
full preferential amounts described in this subsection, then all the remaining Available Funds and
Assets shall be distributed among the holders of the then outstanding Series CC Preferred Stock
on a pro rata basis, according to the number of outstanding shares of Series CC Preferred Stock
then held by them.

(b) Series BB Preferred Stock. If there are any Available Funds and
Assets remaining after the payment or distribution (or the setting aside for payment or
distribution) to the holders of the Series CC Preferred Stock of their full preferential amount
described above in subsection 3.1(a), then the holders of each share of Series BB Preferred Stock
then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid, out of the Available Funds and Assets, and prior and
in preference to any payment or distribution (or any setting apart of any payment or distribution)
of any Available Funds and Assets on any shares of Series AA Preferred Stock or Common
Stock, an amount per share equal to the Original Issue Price for the Series BB Preferred Stock,
plus all declared but unpaid dividends thereon. If upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding
up of the Company the Available Funds and Assets shall be insufficient to permit the payment to
holders of the Series BB Preferred Stock of their full preferential amounts described in this
subsection, then all the remaining Available Funds and Assets shall be distributed among the
holders of the then outstanding Series BB Preferred Stock on a pro rata basis, according to the
number of outstanding shares of Series BB Preferred Stock then held by them.

(c) Series AA Preferred Stock. If there are any Available Funds and
Assets remaining after the payment or distribution (or the setting aside for payment or
distribution) to the holders of the Series CC Preferred Stock and Series BB Preferred Stock of
their full preferential amounts described above in subsections 3.1(a) and 3.1(b), then the holders
of each share of Series AA Preferred Stock then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid, out of
such remaining Available Funds and Assets, and prior and in preference to any payment or
distribution (or any setting apart of any payment or distribution) of any Available Funds and
Assets on any shares of Common Stock, an amount per share equal to the Original Issue Price for
the Series AA Preferred Stock, plus all declared but unpaid dividends thereon. If upon any
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company the Available Funds and Assets shall be
insufficient to permit the payment to holders of the Series AA Preferred Stock of their full
preferential amounts described in this subsection, then all the remaining Available Funds and
Assets shall be distributed among the holders of the then outstanding Series AA Preferred Stock
on a pro rata basis, according to the number of outstanding shares of Series AA Preferred Stock
then held by them.

3.2 No Participation Rights. If there are any Available Funds and Assets
remaining after the payment or distribution (or the setting aside for payment or distribution) to
the holders of the Preferred Stock of their full preferential amounts described above in
subsections 3.1(a), 3.1(b) and 3.1(c), then all such remaining Available Funds and Assets shall be

-5-
24185/00019/DOCS/1623425.4
distributed among the holders of the then outstanding Common Stock on a pro rata basis
according to the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock then held by each of them.

3.3 Merger or Sale of Assets. A (i) consolidation or merger of the Company
with or into any other corporation, corporations or other entity or person in which the holders of
the Company's outstanding shares immediately before such consolidation or merger do not,
immediately after such consolidation or merger, retain a majority of the voting power of the
surviving entity of such consolidation or merger on account of their shareholdings in the
Company immediately prior to such consolidation or merger (an "Acquisition"); or (ii) a sale,
lease or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company (an "Asset
Transfer"), shall each be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company
as those terms are used in this Section 3.

3.4 Deemed Conversion. Notwithstanding the above, for purposes of
determining the amount each holder of shares of Preferred Stock is entitled to receive with
respect to an Acquisition, Asset Transfer or other liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Company, each such holder of shares of a series of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have
converted (regardless of whether such holder actually converted) such holder’s shares of such
series into shares of Common Stock immediately prior to the Acquisition, Asset Transfer or other
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company if, as a result of an actual conversion, such
holder would receive, in the aggregate, an amount greater than the amount that would be
distributed to such holder if such holder did not convert such series of Preferred Stock into shares
of Common Stock. If any such holder shall be deemed to have converted shares of Preferred
Stock into Common Stock pursuant to this paragraph, then such holder shall not be entitled to
receive any distribution that would otherwise be made to holders of Preferred Stock that have not
converted (or have not been deemed to have converted) into shares of Common Stock.

3.5 Non-Cash Consideration. If any assets of the Company distributed to
stockholders in connection with any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company are
other than cash, then the value of such assets shall be their fair market value as determined by the
Board, except that any securities to be distributed to stockholders in a liquidation, dissolution, or
winding up of the Company shall be valued as follows:

(a) The method of valuation of securities not subject to investment
letter or other similar restrictions on free marketability shall be as follows:

(i) if the securities are then traded on a national securities
exchange or the Nasdaq National Market (or a similar national quotation system), then the value
shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange or
system over the 30-day period ending three (3) days prior to the distribution; and

(ii) if actively traded over-the-counter, then the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing bid prices over the 30-day period ending three (3) days
prior to the distribution; and

24185/00019/D0CS/1623425.4
(iii) if there is no active public market, then the value shall be
the fair market value thereof, as mutually determined in good faith by the Board and the holders
of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock.

(b) The method of valuation of securities subject to investment letter
or other restrictions on free marketability shall be to make an appropriate discount from the
market value determined as above in subparagraphs (a)(1), (ii) or (iii) of this subsection to reflect
the approximate fair market value thereof, as mutually determined in good faith by the Board and
the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of Preferred
Stock.

4. Voting Rights.

4.1 Common Stock. Each holder of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled
to one (1) vote for each share thereof held.

4.2 Preferred Stock. Each holder of shares of Preferred Stock shall be entitled
to the number of votes equal to the number of whole shares of Common Stock into which such

record date for the determination of the stockholders entitled to vote on such matters or, if no
such record date is established, the date such vote is taken or any written consent of stockholders
is solicited.

of Preferred Stock shall have full voting rights and powers equal to the voting rights and powers
of the holders of Common Stock, and shall be entitled to notice of any stockholders’ meeting in

law, and shall be entitled to vote, together with the holders of Common Stock, with respect to
any question upon which holders of Common Stock have the right to vote, except as may be
otherwise provided by applicable law. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or as
required by law, the holders of Preferred Stock and the holders of Common Stock shall vote
together and not as separate classes. At each election of directors of the Company to be elected
by holders of Specified Stock (as defined in Section 4.5(b)(ii) below) pursuant to the provisions
of Section 4.5(a) below for which cumulative voting is provided for in the applicable provisions
of Section 4.5(a), each holder of any shares of the applicable Specified Stock entitled to vote in
such election shall be entitled to as many votes as shall equal the number of votes represented by
such holder’s shares of such Specified Stock entitled to vote in such election multiplied by the
number of directors to be elected by the holders of such Specified Stock in such election, and
such holder may cast all of such votes for a single director to be so elected or may distribute them
among the number of directors to be voted for in such election, or for any two (2) or more of
them, as the holder may see fit.

4.4 Board Size. The authorized number of directors of the Company’s Board
shall be eight (8); provided, however, that following a Qualified Initial Public Offering Closing,

(b) Upon the occurrence of any event specified in subsection 5.2(a)
above, the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted into Common Stock
automatically without the need for any further action by the holders of such shares and whether
or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Company or its transfer
agent; provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to issue certificates
evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion unless the certificates
evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are either delivered to the Company or its transfer
agent as provided below, or the holder notifies the Company or its transfer agent that such
certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the
Company to indemnify the Company from any loss incurred by it in connection with such
certificates. Upon the occurrence of such automatic conversion of the Preferred Stock, the
holders of Preferred Stock shall surrender the certificates representing such shares at the office of
the Company or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock or Common Stock. Thereupon, there
shall be issued and delivered to such holder promptly at such office and in its name as shown on
such surrendered certificate or certificates, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of
Common Stock into which the shares of Preferred Stock surrendered were convertible on the
date on which such automatic conversion occurred, and any declared and unpaid dividends shall
be paid in accordance with the provisions of subsection 2.1.

5.3 Conversion Price. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible in
accordance with subsection 5.1 or subsection 5.2 above into the number of shares of Common
Stock which results from dividing the applicable Conversion Amount for such series (as defined
below) by the conversion price for such series of Preferred Stock that is in effect at the time of
conversion (the "Conversion Price"). The “Conversion Amount” for the Series AA Preferred
Stock shall be $1.606 and shall be subject to adjustment for any applicable preferred stock split,
stock combination, stock dividend or similar event after the Filing Date. The “Conversion
Amount” for the Series BB Preferred Stock shall be $1.606 and shall be subject to adjustment

-11-

24185/00019/DO0CS/1623425.4
for any applicable preferred stock split, stock combination, stock dividend or similar event after
the Filing Date. The “Conversion Amount” for the Series CC Preferred Stock shall be the
Original Issue Price for the Series CC Preferred Stock and shall be subject to adjustment for any
applicable preferred stock split, stock combination, stock dividend or similar event after the
Filing Date. The initial Conversion Price for the Series AA Preferred Stock and the Series BB
Preferred Stock shall be the Original Issue Price for the Series BB Preferred Stock. The initial
Conversion Price for the Series CC Preferred Stock shall be the Original Issue Price for the
Series CC Preferred Stock. The Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock shall be
subject to adjustment from time to time as provided below and also for any applicable preferred
stock split, stock combination, stock dividend or similar event after the Filing Date.

5.4 Adjustment Upon Common Stock Event. Upon the happening of a
Common Stock Event (as hereinafter defined) following the Filing Date, the Conversion Price of

each series of Preferred Stock shall, simultaneously with the happening of such Common Stock
Event, be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock in effect
immediately prior to such Common Stock Event by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which shall be
the number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to such
Common Stock Event, and (ii) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately after such Common Stock Event, and the
product so obtained shall thereafter be the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock.
The Conversion Price for a series of Preferred Stock shall be readjusted in the same manner upon
the happening of each subsequent Common Stock Event. As used herein, the term

"Common Stock Event" shall mean (i) the issue by the Company of additional shares of
Common Stock as a dividend or other distribution on outstanding Common Stock, (ii) a
subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares of
Common Stock, or (iii) a combination of the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller
number of shares of Common Stock.

5.5 Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. If at any time or from
time to time after the Filing Date the Company pays a dividend or makes another distribution to

the holders of the Common Stock payable in securities of the Company other than shares of
Common Stock, then in each such event provision shall be made so that the holders of each
series of Preferred Stock shall then receive the amount of securities of the Company which they
would have received had their Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock on the date of
such event (or such record date, as applicable). This subsection 5.5 takes precedence over
Section 2, and accordingly dividends payable in securities of the Company other than shares of
Common Stock shall be governed by this subsection 5.5 and not Section 2.

5.6 Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. If at any time
or from time to time after the Filing Date the Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of

Preferred Stock is changed into the same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of
stock, whether by recapitalization, reclassification or otherwise (other than by a Common Stock
Event or a dividend covered by subsections 5.4 or 5.5, or a reorganization, merger, consolidation
or sale of assets provided for elsewhere in subsection 3.3 or subsection 5.7), then in any such
event each holder of Preferred Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such stock into the
kind and amount of stock and other securities and property receivable upon such recapitalization,

-12-
24185/00019/D0CS/1623425.4

reclassification or other change by holders of the number of shares of Common Stock into which
such shares of Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately prior to such
recapitalization, reclassification or change, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein or
with respect to such other securities or property by the terms thereof.

5.7 Reorganizations, Mergers and Consolidations. If at any time or from time
to time after the Filing Date there is a reorganization of the Company (other than a

recapitalization, subdivision, combination, reclassification or exchange of shares provided for
elsewhere in this Section 5) or a merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another
corporation (except an event which is governed under subsection 3.3), then, as a part of such
reorganization, merger or consolidation, provision shall be made so that the holders of the
Preferred Stock thereafter shall be entitled to receive, upon conversion of the Preferred Stock, the
number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the Company, or of such successor
corporation resulting from such reorganization, merger or consolidation, to which a holder of
that number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock
immediately prior to the closing of such reorganization, merger or consolidation would have been
entitled on such reorganization, merger or consolidation. In any such case, appropriate
adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 5 with respect to the
rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock after the reorganization, merger or consolidation to
the end that the provisions of this Section 5 (including adjustment of the Conversion Price then
in effect and number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be
applicable after that event and be as nearly equivalent to the provisions hereof as may be
practicable. This subsection 5.7 shall similarly apply to successive reorganizations, mergers and
consolidations.

5.8 Sale of Shares Below Conversion Price.

(a) Adjustment Formula. If at any time or from time to time after the
Merger Date the Company issues or sells, or is deemed by the provisions of this subsection 5.8 to
have issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock (as hereinafter defined), otherwise than
in connection with a Common Stock Event as provided in subsection 5.4, a dividend or
distribution as provided in subsection 5.5, or a recapitalization, reclassification or other change as
provided in subsection 5.6 or 5.7, for an Effective Price (as hereinafter defined) that is less than
the Conversion Price for an outstanding series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to
such issue or sale, then, and in each such case, the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred
Stock shall be reduced, as of the close of business on the date of such issue or sale, to the price
obtained by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction:

(i) The numerator of which shall be the sum of (A) the number
of Common Stock Equivalents Outstanding (as hereinafter defined) immediately prior to such
issue or sale of Additional Shares of Common Stock plus (B) the quotient obtained by dividing
the Aggregate Consideration Received (as hereinafter defined) by the Company for the total
number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued or sold (or deemed so issued and sold)
by the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such
issue or sale; and

-13-
24185/00019/D0CS/1623425.4
(ii) The denominator of which shall be the sum of (A) the
number of Common Stock Equivalents Outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale plus
(B) the number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued or sold (or deemed so issued
and sold).

(b) Certain Definitions. For the purpose of making any adjustment
required under this subsection 5.8:

(i) "Additional Shares of Common Stock" shall mean all
shares of Common Stock issued by the Company, whether or not subsequently reacquired or
retired by the Company, other than: (A) shares of Common Stock (or options, warrants, or other
securities (including without limitation Preferred Stock) or rights directly or indirectly
exercisable or convertible therefore and the underlying Common Stock) outstanding on the
Merger Date; (B) shares of Common Stock (or options, warrants or rights directly or indirectly
exercisable therefore and the underlying Common Stock) issued to employees, officers or
directors of, or contractors, consultants or advisers to, the Company or any Subsidiary pursuant to
stock purchase or stock option plans, stock bonuses or awards, or other incentive stock
arrangements that are approved by the Board; (C) shares of Common Stock (or options, warrants
or rights directly or indirectly exercisable therefore and the underlying Common Stock) issued to
lenders, equipment lessors, or other parties providing goods or services to the Company, pursuant
to contracts or other arrangements that are approved by at least 80% of the members of the Board
pursuant to resolutions acknowledging that anti-dilution protection is being waived with respect
to the issuance of such shares; or (D) any shares of capital stock of the Company (or any options
or warrants or rights directly or indirectly exercisable therefore and the underlying Common
Stock) issued or assumed by the Company pursuant to the Reincorporation Merger and any stock
or other securities issued pursuant to any such options, warrants or rights.

(ii) The "Aggregate Consideration Received" by the Company

for any issue or sale (or deemed issue or sale) of securities shall (A) to the extent it consists of
cash, be computed at the gross amount of cash received by the Company before deduction of any
underwriting or similar commissions, compensation or concessions paid or allowed by the
Company in connection with such issue or sale and without deduction of any expenses payable
by the Company; (B) to the extent it consists of property other than cash, be computed at the fair
value of that property as determined in good faith by the Board; and (C) if Additional Shares of
Common Stock, Convertible Securities or Rights or Options to purchase either Additional Shares
of Common Stock or Convertible Securities are issued or sold together with other stock or
securities or other assets of the Company for a consideration which covers both, be computed as
the portion of the consideration so received that may be reasonably determined in good faith by
the Board to be allocable to such Additional Shares of Common Stock, Convertible Securities or
Rights or Options.

(iii) | "Common Stock Equivalents Outstanding" shall mean the

number of shares of Common Stock that is equal to the sum of (A) all shares of Common Stock
of the Company that are outstanding at the time in question, plus (B) all shares of Common Stock
of the Company issuable upon conversion of all shares of Preferred Stock or other Convertible
Securities that are outstanding at the time in question, plus (C) all shares of Common Stock of

-14-
24185/00019/DOCS/1623425.4
the Company that are issuable upon the exercise of Rights or Options that are outstanding at the
time in question assuming the full conversion or exchange into Common Stock of all such Rights
or Options that are Rights or Options to purchase or acquire Convertible Securities into or for
Common Stock.

(iv) "Convertible Securities" shall mean stock or other
securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock.

(v) The "Effective Price" of Additional Shares of Common
Stock shall mean the quotient determined by dividing the total number of Additional Shares of
Common Stock issued or sold, or deemed to have been issued or sold, by the Company under this
subsection 5.8, into the Aggregate Consideration Received, or deemed to have been received, by
the Company under this subsection 5.8, for the issue of such Additional Shares of Common
Stock; and

(vi) “Rights or Options" shall mean warrants, options or other
rights to purchase or acquire shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities.

(c) Deemed Issuances. For the purpose of making any adjustment to
the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock required under this subsection 5.8, if the
Company issues or sells any Rights or Options or Convertible Securities and if the Effective
Price of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Rights or Options and/or the
conversion or exchange of Convertible Securities (computed without reference to any additional
or similar protective or antidilution clauses) is less than the Conversion Price then in effect for a
series of Preferred Stock, then the Company shall be deemed to have issued, at the time of the
issuance of such Rights, Options or Convertible Securities, that number of Additional Shares of
Common Stock that is equal to the maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
exercise or conversion of such Rights, Options or Convertible Securities upon their issuance and
to have received, as the Aggregate Consideration Received for the issuance of such shares, an
amount equal to the total amount of the consideration, if any, received by the Company for the
issuance of such Rights or Options or Convertible Securities, plus, in the case of such Rights or
Options, the minimum amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon the
exercise in full of such Rights or Options, plus, in the case of Convertible Securities, the
minimum amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Company (other than by cancellation
of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities) upon the conversion or
exchange thereof; provided that:

(i) if the minimum amounts of such consideration cannot be
ascertained, but are a function of antidilution or similar protective clauses, then the Company
shall be deemed to have received the minimum amounts of consideration without reference to
such clauses;

(ii) if the minimum amount of consideration payable to the
Company upon the exercise of Rights or Options or the conversion or exchange of Convertible
Securities is reduced over time or upon the occurrence or non-occurrence of specified events
other than by reason of antidilution or similar protective adjustments, then the Effective Price

-15-

24185/00019/DOCS/1623425.4

shall be recalculated as of such date using the figure to which such minimum amount of
consideration is reduced; and

(iii) if the minimum amount of consideration payable to the
Company upon the exercise of such Rights or Options or the conversion or exchange of
Convertible Securities is subsequently increased, then the Effective Price shall again be
recalculated as of such date using the increased minimum amount of consideration payable to the
Company upon the exercise of such Rights or Options or the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities.

No further adjustment of the Conversion Price, adjusted upon the issuance of such Rights or
Options or Convertible Securities, shall be made as a result of the actual issuance of shares of
Common Stock on the exercise of any such Rights or Options or the conversion or exchange of
any such Convertible Securities. If any such Rights or Options or the conversion rights
represented by any such Convertible Securities shall expire without having been fully exercised,
then the Conversion Price as adjusted upon the issuance of such Rights or Options or Convertible
Securities shall be readjusted to the Conversion Price which would have been in effect had an
adjustment been made on the basis that the only shares of Common Stock so issued were the
shares of Common Stock, if any, that were actually issued or sold on the exercise of such Rights
or Options or rights of conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, and such shares of
Common Stock, if any, were issued or sold for the consideration actually received by the
Company upon such exercise, plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the Company
for the granting of all such Rights or Options, whether or not exercised, plus the consideration
received for issuing or selling all such Convertible Securities actually converted or exchanged,
plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the Company (other than by cancellation of
liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities) on the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, provided that such readjustment shall not apply to prior
conversions of Preferred Stock.

5.9 Certificate of Adjustment. In each case of an adjustment or readjustment
of the Conversion Price for a series of Preferred Stock, the Company, at its expense, shall cause
its Chief Financial Officer to compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the
provisions hereof and prepare a certificate showing such adjustment or readjustment, and shall
mail such certificate, by first class mail, postage prepaid, to each registered holder of the
Preferred Stock at the holder's address as shown in the Company's books.

5.10 Notices of Record Date. Upon (i) any taking by the Company of a record
of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof who
are entitled to receive any dividend or other distribution, or (ii) any Acquisition (as defined in
subsection 3.3) or other capital reorganization of the Company, any reclassification or
recapitalization of the capital stock of the Company, any merger or consolidation of the Company
with or into any other corporation, or any Asset Transfer (as defined in subsection 3.3), or any
voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company, the Company
shall mail to each holder of Preferred Stock at least twenty (20) days prior to the record date
specified therein a notice specifying (A) the date on which any such record is to be taken for the
purpose of such dividend or distribution and a description of such dividend or distribution,

-16-

24185/00019/D0CS/1623425.4
(B) the date on which any such Acquisition, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization,
consolidation, merger, Asset Transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to
become effective, and (C) the date, if any, that is to be fixed as to when the holders of record of
Common Stock (or other securities) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock
(or other securities) for securities or other property deliverable upon such Acquisition,
reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, consolidation, merger, Asset Transfer,
dissolution, liquidation or winding up.

5.11 Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued
upon any conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional share to which the holder
would otherwise be entitled, the Company shall pay the holder cash equal to the product of such
fraction multiplied by the Common Stock's fair market value as determined in good faith by the
Board as of the date of conversion.

5.12 Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Company shall at all
times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock,

solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock, such
number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, the Company will take such corporate
action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.

5.13 Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Section 5 to be
given to the holders of shares of the Preferred Stock shall be deemed given upon the earlier of
(1) actual receipt, (ii) deposit in the United States mail, by certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested, postage prepaid, or (iii) delivery to an express courier service, fees prepaid,
addressed to each holder of record at the address of such holder appearing on the books of the
Company.

5.14 Payment of Taxes. The Company will pay all taxes (other than taxes
based upon income) and other governmental charges that may be imposed with respect to the
issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of shares of Preferred Stock,
excluding any tax or other charge imposed in connection with any transfer involved in the issue
and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in which the shares of
Preferred Stock so converted were registered.

6. Restrictions and Limitations.

6.1 Protective Provisions. So long at least 300,000 shares of Preferred Stock
remain outstanding (as adjusted for any applicable preferred stock split, stock combination, stock
dividend or similar event after the Filing Date), the Company shall not (by amendment, merger,
consolidation or otherwise), without the approval, by vote or written consent, of the holders of at
least a majority of the Preferred Stock then outstanding (determined on an as-converted-to-
common basis as set forth in subsection 4.2), voting as a single class (except to the extent that

(11) initiate voluntary dissolution or liquidation of the Company.

24185/00019/D0CS/1623425.4
8. Miscellaneous

8.1 No Reissuance of Preferred Stock. No share or shares of Preferred Stock
acquired by the Company by reason of purchase, conversion or otherwise shall be reissued, and
all such shares shall be canceled, retired and eliminated from the shares which the Company shall
be authorized to issue.

8.2 Consent to Certain Transactions. Each holder of shares of Preferred Stock

ARTICLE VI

The Board of Directors of the corporation shall have the power to adopt, amend or repeal
Bylaws of the corporation.

ARTICLE VII

Election of directors need not be by written ballot unless the Bylaws of the corporation
shall so provide.

ARTICLE VIII

To the fullest extent permitted by law, no director of the corporation shall be personally
liable for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. Without limiting the
effect of the preceding sentence, if the Delaware General Corporation Law is hereafter amended
to authorize the further elimination or limitation of the liability of a director, then the liability of
a director of the corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the
Delaware General Corporation Law, as so amended.

Neither any amendment nor repeal of this Article VIL, nor the adoption of any provision
of this Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this Article VIII, shall eliminate, reduce or
otherwise adversely affect any limitation on the personal liability of a director of the corporation
existing at the time of such amendment, repeal or adoption of such an inconsistent provision.

ARTICLE IX

1. Qualified Initial Public Offering Closing. The term “Qualified Initial Public
Offering” means a firm commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective
registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, covering the offer and
sale of the corporation’s Common Stock in which all of the then outstanding shares of this
corporation’s Preferred Stock are converted into Common Stock. The term “Qualified Initial
Public Offering Closing” means the closing of a Qualified Initial Public Offering.

2. Provisions Effective Upon Qualified Initial Public Offering Closing. The
provisions set forth in the following subsections of this Section 2 will become effective

-19-

24185/00019/DOCS/1623425.4

immediately upon (and only upon) a Qualified Initial Public Offering Closing:

2.1 Number of Directors. The number of directors shall be fixed from time to
time exclusively by resolution of the Board of Directors. No decrease in the authorized number
of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director.

2.2 Classes of Directors. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of
Preferred Stock to elect additional directors under specified circumstances, the directors shall be
divided, with respect to the time for which they severally hold office, into three classes
designated as Class I, Class II and Class Il. Directors may be assigned to each class in
accordance with a resolution or resolutions adopted by the affirmative vote of outstanding shares
possessing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of the corporation entitled to
vote, with the number of directors in each class to be divided as equally as reasonably possible.
The Board of Directors is authorized to assign members of the Board of Directors already in
office to such classes after such time as the classification of the Board of Directors becomes
effective. The initial term of office of the Class I directors shall expire at the corporation’s first
annual meeting of stockholders following the Qualified Initial Public Offering Closing, the initial
term of office of the Class II directors shall expire at the corporation’s second annual meeting of
stockholders following the Qualified Initial Public Offering Closing, and the initial term of office
of the Class III directors shall expire at the corporation’s third annual meeting of stockholders
following the Qualified Initial Public Offering Closing. At each annual meeting of stockholders
commencing with the first annual meeting of stockholders following the Qualified Initial Public
Offering Closing, directors elected to succeed those directors of the class whose terms then
expire shall be elected for a term of office to expire at the third succeeding annual meeting of
stockholders after their election, with each director to hold office until his or her successor shall
have been duly elected and qualified, or until such director’s earlier death, resignation or
removal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing provisions of this
Section 2.2, each director shall hold office until such director's successor is elected and qualified,
or until such director's earlier death, resignation or removal. In the event of any increase or
decrease in the authorized number of directors, (a) each director then serving as such shall
nevertheless continue as a director of the class of which he or she is a member and (b) the newly
created or eliminated directorships resulting from such increase or decrease shall be apportioned
by the Board of Directors among the three classes of directors so as to ensure that no one class
has more than one director more than any other class.

2.3. Removal. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred
Stock, no director may be removed from the Board of Directors except for cause by the holders
of a majority of the voting power of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors.

2.4 Vacancies. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred
Stock, any vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors for any cause, and any newly created
directorship resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors, shall, unless (a)
the Board of Directors determines by resolution that any such vacancies or newly created
directorships shall be filled by the stockholders or (b) applicable law otherwise requires, be filled
only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a
quorum, or by a sole remaining director, and not by the stockholders. Any director elected in

-20-
24185/00019/D0CS/1623425.4
accordance with the preceding sentence shall (a) if elected to fill a vacancy not created by a
newly created directorship, be elected to a class of directors in which such vacancy exists and (b)
hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders at which the term of office
of the class of directors to which the director has been assigned expires or until such director's
successor shall have been duly elected and qualified or until such director’s successor’s earlier
death, resignation or removal.

2.5 Stockholder Action. No action shall be taken by the stockholders of the
corporation except at an annual or special meeting of stockholders called in accordance with the
Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws of the corporation, and no action shall be taken by
the stockholders by written consent.

2.6 Special Stockholder Meetings. Special meetings of stockholders for any
purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the Board of Directors, and shall be called
upon the request of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer or by a
majority of the members of the Board of Directors. Special meetings of stockholders may not be
called by any other person or persons.

2.7. Nominations, etc. Advance notice of stockholder nominations for the
election of directors of the corporation and of business to be brought by stockholders before any
meeting of stockholders of the corporation shall be given in the manner provided in the Bylaws
of the corporation. Business transacted at special meetings of stockholders shall be confined to
the purpose or purposes stated in the notice of meeting.

To the extent that, upon or after the Qualified Initial Public Offering Closing, any
of the provisions of this Article IX are inconsistent with, or in conflict with, any other provisions
of this First Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the provisions of this Article [IX
shall supersede, govern and prevail.

deemed to be the average of the closing bid prices over the 30-day period ending three (3) days

shall be issued and delivered to such holder promptly at such office and in its name as shown on
such surrendered certificate or certificates, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of
Common Stock into which the shares of Preferred Stock surrendered were convertible on the
date on which such automatic conversion occurred, and any declared and unpaid dividends shall
be paid in accordance with the provisions of subsection 2.1.

5.3. Conversion Price. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible in
accordance with subsection 5.1 or subsection 5.2 above into the number of shares of Common
Stock which results from dividing the applicable Conversion Amount for such series (as defined
below) by the conversion price for such series of Preferred Stock that is in effect at the time of
conversion (the "Conversion Price"). The “Conversion Amount” for the Series AA Preferred
Stock shall be $1.606 and shall be subject to adjustment for any applicable preferred stock split,
stock combination, stock dividend or similar event after the OriginalssueFiling Date. The
“Conversion Amount” for the Series BB Preferred Stock shall be $1.606 and shall be subject to
adjustment for any applicable preferred stock split, stock combination, stock dividend or similar
event after the Original issueFiling Date. The “Conversion Amount” for the Series CC Preferred
Stock shall be the Original Issue Price for the Series CC Preferred Stock and shall be subject to
adjustment for any applicable preferred stock split, stock combination, stock dividend or similar
event after the OriginalissueFiling Date. The initial Conversion Price for the Series AA
Preferred Stock and the Series BB Preferred Stock shall be the Original Issue Price for the Series
BB Preferred Stock. The initial Conversion Price for the Series CC Preferred Stock shall be the
Original Issue Price for the Series CC Preferred Stock. The Conversion Price of each series of
Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided below and also for
any applicable preferred stock split, stock combination, stock dividend or similar event after the

OriginalssueFiling Date.

5.4 Adjustment Upon Common Stock Event. Upon the happening of a
Common Stock Event (as hereinafter defined) following the Filing Date, the Conversion Price of

each series of Preferred Stock shall, simultaneously with the happening of such Common Stock
Event, be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock in effect
immediately prior to such Common Stock Event by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which shall be
the number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to such
Common Stock Event, and (ii) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of

-12-

24185/00019/DOCS/1623425.4

Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately after such Common Stock Event, and the
product so obtained shall thereafter be the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock.
The Conversion Price for a series of Preferred Stock shall be readjusted in the same manner upon
the happening of each subsequent Common Stock Event. As used herein, the term "Common
Stock Event" shall mean (i) the issue by the Company of additional shares of Common Stock as a
dividend or other distribution on outstanding Common Stock, (ii) a subdivision of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, or (iii) a
combination of the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares of
Common Stock.

5.5 Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. If at any time or from
time to time after the OriginallssueFiling Date the Company pays a dividend or makes another

distribution to the holders of the Common Stock payable in securities of the Company other than
shares of Common Stock, then in each such event provision shall be made so that the holders of
each series of Preferred Stock shall then receive the amount of securities of the Company which
they would have received had their Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock on the
date of such event (or such record date, as applicable). This subsection 5.5 takes precedence over
Section 2, and accordingly dividends payable in securities of the Company other than shares of
Common Stock shall be governed by this subsection 5.5 and not Section 2.

5.6 Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. If at any time
or from time to time after the Original ssueFiling Date the Common Stock issuable upon the

conversion of Preferred Stock is changed into the same or a different number of shares of any
class or classes of stock, whether by recapitalization, reclassification or otherwise (other than by
a Common Stock Event or a dividend covered by subsections 5.4 or 5.5, or a reorganization,
merger, consolidation or sale of assets provided for elsewhere in subsection 3.3 or subsection
5.7), then in any such event each holder of Preferred Stock shall have the right thereafter to
convert such stock into the kind and amount of stock and other securities and property receivable
upon such recapitalization, reclassification or other change by holders of the number of shares of
Common Stock into which such shares of Preferred Stock could have been converted
immediately prior to such recapitalization, reclassification or change, all subject to further
adjustment as provided herein or with respect to such other securities or property by the terms
thereof.

5.7 Reorganizations, Mergers and Consolidations. If at any time or from time
to time after the Original tssueFiling Date there is a reorganization of the Company (other than a

recapitalization, subdivision, combination, reclassification or exchange of shares provided for
elsewhere in this Section 5) or a merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another
corporation (except an event which is governed under subsection 3.3), then, as a part of such
reorganization, merger or consolidation, provision shall be made so that the holders of the
Preferred Stock thereafter shall be entitled to receive, upon conversion of the Preferred Stock, the
number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the Company, or of such successor
corporation resulting from such reorganization, merger or consolidation, to which a holder of
that number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock
immediately prior to the closing of such reorganization, merger or consolidation would have been
entitled on such reorganization, merger or consolidation. In any such case, appropriate

-13-

24185/00019/D0CS/1623425.4

adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 5 with respect to the
rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock after the reorganization, merger or consolidation to
the end that the provisions of this Section 5 (including adjustment of the Conversion Price then
in effect and number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be
applicable after that event and be as nearly equivalent to the provisions hereof as may be
practicable. This subsection 5.7 shall similarly apply to successive reorganizations, mergers and
consolidations.

5.8 Sale of Shares Below Conversion Price.

(a) Adjustment Formula. If at any time or from time to time after the
Original ssueMerger Date the Company issues or sells, or is deemed by the provisions of this
subsection 5.8 to have issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock (as hereinafter
defined), otherwise than in connection with a Common Stock Event as provided in subsection
5.4, a dividend or distribution as provided in subsection 5.5, or a recapitalization, reclassification
or other change as provided in subsection 5.6 or 5.7, for an Effective Price (as hereinafter
defined) that is less than the Conversion Price for an outstanding series of Preferred Stock in
effect immediately prior to such issue or sale, then, and in each such case, the Conversion Price
for such series of Preferred Stock shall be reduced, as of the close of business on the date of such
issue or sale, to the price obtained by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction:

(i) The numerator of which shall be the sum of (A) the number
of Common Stock Equivalents Outstanding (as hereinafter defined) immediately prior to such
issue or sale of Additional Shares of Common Stock plus (B) the quotient obtained by dividing
the Aggregate Consideration Received (as hereinafter defined) by the Company for the total
number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued or sold (or deemed so issued and sold)
by the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such
issue or sale; and

(ii) | The denominator of which shall be the sum of (A) the
number of Common Stock Equivalents Outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale plus
(B) the number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued or sold (or deemed so issued
and sold).

(b) Certain Definitions. For the purpose of making any adjustment
required under this subsection 5.8:

(i) "Additional Shares of Common Stock" shall mean all
shares of Common Stock issued by the Company, whether or not subsequently reacquired or
retired by the Company, other than: (A) shares of Common Stock (or options, warrants, or other
securities (including without limitation Preferred Stock) or rights directly or indirectly
exercisable or convertible therefore and the underlying Common Stock) outstanding on the
Original IssueMerger Date; (B) shares of Common Stock (or options, warrants or rights directly
or indirectly exercisable therefore and the underlying Common Stock) issued to employees,

warrants or rights directly or indirectly exercisable therefore and the underlying Common Stock)
issued to lenders, equipment lessors, or other parties providing goods or services to the

members of the Board pursuant to resolutions acknowledging that anti-dilution protection is

being waived with respect to the issuance of such shares; or (D) any shares of capital stock of the
Company (or any options or warrants or rights directly or indirectly exercisable therefore and the
underlying Common Stock) issued or assumed by the Company pursuant to the Reincorporation
Merger and any stock or other securities issued pursuant to any such options, warrants or rights.

(ii) The "Aggregate Consideration Received" by the Company

for any issue or sale (or deemed issue or sale) of securities shall (A) to the extent it consists of
cash, be computed at the gross amount of cash received by the Company before deduction of any
underwriting or similar commissions, compensation or concessions paid or allowed by the
Company in connection with such issue or sale and without deduction of any expenses payable
by the Company; (B) to the extent it consists of property other than cash, be computed at the fair -
value of that property as determined in good faith by the Board; and (C) if Additional Shares of
Common Stock, Convertible Securities or Rights or Options to purchase either Additional Shares
of Common Stock or Convertible Securities are issued or sold together with other stock or
securities or other assets of the Company for a consideration which covers both, be computed as
the portion of the consideration so received that may be reasonably determined in good faith by
the Board to be allocable to such Additional Shares of Common Stock, Convertible Securities or
Rights or Options.

(iii) | "Common Stock Equivalents Outstanding" shall mean the

number of shares of Common Stock that is equal to the sum of (A) all shares of Common Stock
of the Company that are outstanding at the time in question, plus (B) all shares of Common Stock
of the Company issuable upon conversion of all shares of Preferred Stock or other Convertible
Securities that are outstanding at the time in question, plus (C) all shares of Common Stock of
the Company that are issuable upon the exercise of Rights or Options that are outstanding at the

Common Stock.

securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock.

(v) The "Effective Price" of Additional Shares of Common
Stock shall mean the quotient determined by dividing the total number of Additional Shares of
Common Stock issued or sold, or deemed to have been issued or sold, by the Company under this
subsection 5.8, into the Aggregate Consideration Received, or deemed to have been received, by

24185/00019/D0CS/1623425.4

(c) Deemed Issuances. For the purpose of making any adjustment to
the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock required under this subsection 5.8, if the
Company issues or sells any Rights or Options or Convertible Securities and if the Effective
Price of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Rights or Options and/or the
conversion or exchange of Convertible Securities (computed without reference to any additional
or similar protective or antidilution clauses) is less than the Conversion Price then in effect for a
series of Preferred Stock, then the Company shall be deemed to have issued, at the time of the
issuance of such Rights, Options or Convertible Securities, that number of Additional Shares of
Common Stock that is equal to the maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
exercise or conversion of such Rights, Options or Convertible Securities upon their issuance and
to have received, as the Aggregate Consideration Received for the issuance of such shares, an
amount equal to the total amount of the consideration, if any, received by the Company for the
issuance of such Rights or Options or Convertible Securities, plus, in the case of such Rights or
Options, the minimum amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon the
exercise in full of such Rights or Options, plus, in the case of Convertible Securities, the
minimum amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Company (other than by cancellation
of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities) upon the conversion or
exchange thereof; provided that:

(i) if the minimum amounts of such consideration cannot be
ascertained, but are a function of antidilution or similar protective clauses, then the Company
shall be deemed to have received the minimum amounts of consideration without reference to
such clauses;

(ii) ifthe minimum amount of consideration payable to the
Company upon the exercise of Rights or Options or the conversion or exchange of Convertible
Securities is reduced over time or upon the occurrence or non-occurrence of specified events
other than by reason of antidilution or similar protective adjustments, then the Effective Price
shall be recalculated as of such date using the figure to which such minimum amount of
consideration is reduced; and

(iii) if the minimum amount of consideration payable to the
Company upon the exercise of such Rights or Options or the conversion or exchange of
Convertible Securities is subsequently increased, then the Effective Price shall again be
recalculated as of such date using the increased minimum amount of consideration payable to the
Company upon the exercise of such Rights or Options or the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities.

No further adjustment of the Conversion Price, adjusted upon the issuance of such Rights or
Options or Convertible Securities, shall be made as a result of the actual issuance of shares of
Common Stock on the exercise of any such Rights or Options or the conversion or exchange of
any such Convertible Securities. If any such Rights or Options or the conversion rights
represented by any such Convertible Securities shall expire without having been fully exercised,
then the Conversion Price as adjusted upon the issuance of such Rights or Options or Convertible
Securities shall be readjusted to the Conversion Price which would have been in effect had an
adjustment been made on the basis that the only shares of Common Stock so issued were the

-16-

24185/00019/DOCS/1623425.4

shares of Common Stock, if any, that were actually issued or sold on the exercise of such Rights
or Options or rights of conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, and such shares of
Common Stock, if any, were issued or sold for the consideration actually received by the
Company upon such exercise, plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the Company
for the granting of all such Rights or Options, whether or not exercised, plus the consideration
received for issuing or selling all such Convertible Securities actually converted or exchanged,
plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the Company (other than by cancellation of
liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities) on the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, provided that such readjustment shall not apply to prior
conversions of Preferred Stock.

5.9 Certificate of Adjustment. In each case of an adjustment or readjustment
of the Conversion Price for a series of Preferred Stock, the Company, at its expense, shall cause
its Chief Financial Officer to compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the
provisions hereof and prepare a certificate showing such adjustment or readjustment, and shall
mail such certificate, by first class mail, postage prepaid, to each registered holder of the
Preferred Stock at the holder's address as shown in the Company's books.

5.10 Notices of Record Date. Upon (i) any taking by the Company of a record
of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof who
are entitled to receive any dividend or other distribution, or (ii) any Acquisition (as defined in
subsection 3.3) or other capital reorganization of the Company, any reclassification or
recapitalization of the capital stock of the Company, any merger or consolidation of the Company
with or into any other corporation, or any Asset Transfer (as defined in subsection 3.3), or any
voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company, the Company
shall mail to each holder of Preferred Stock at least twenty (20) days prior to the record date
specified therein a notice specifying (A) the date on which any such record is to be taken for the
purpose of such dividend or distribution and a description of such dividend or distribution, (B)
the date on which any such Acquisition, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization,
consolidation, merger, Asset Transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to
become effective, and (C) the date, if any, that is to be fixed as to when the holders of record of
Common Stock (or other securities) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock
(or other securities) for securities or other property deliverable upon such Acquisition,
reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, consolidation, merger, Asset Transfer,
dissolution, liquidation or winding up.

5.11 Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued
upon any conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional share to which the holder
would otherwise be entitled, the Company shall pay the holder cash equal to the product of such
fraction multiplied by the Common Stock's fair market value as determined in good faith by the
Board as of the date of conversion.

5.12 Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Company shall at all
times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock,

solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock, such
number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the

-17-

24185/00019/DOCS/1623425.4

conversion of all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, the Company will take such corporate
action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.

5.13 Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Section 5 to be
given to the holders of shares of the Preferred Stock shall be deemed given upon the earlier of (i)
actual receipt, (ii) deposit in the United States mail, by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested, postage prepaid, or (iii) delivery to an express courier service, fees prepaid, addressed
to each holder of record at the address of such holder appearing on the books of the Company.

5.14 Payment of Taxes. The Company will pay all taxes (other than taxes
based upon income) and other governmental charges that may be imposed with respect to the
issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of shares of Preferred Stock,
excluding any tax or other charge imposed in connection with any transfer involved in the issue
and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in which the shares of
Preferred Stock so converted were registered.
