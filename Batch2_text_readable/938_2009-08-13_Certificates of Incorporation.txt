preference to any Distribution of any of the assets or surplus funds of the Corporation to the holders of
Common Stock, the Series A’ Preferred Stock or the Series AA’ Preferred Stock by reason of their ownership

of the Series B’ Preferred Stock or Series BB’ Preferred Stock, as applicable, are insufficient to permit the

then held by each such holder by the Liquidation Preference for the Series B’ Preferred Stock or multiplying
the number of shares of Series BB’ Preferred Stock then held by each such holder by the Liquidation
Preference for the Series BB’ Preferred Stock.

{b) Series A’ and Series AA’ Liquidation Preference. After the payment to the holders
of Series B’ Preferred Stock or Series BB’ Preferred Stock, as applicable, of the full amounts specified in

Section 3(a) above, the holders of the Series A’ Preferred Stock or Series AA’ Preferred Stock, as applicable,

Stock or Series AA’ Preferred Stock, as applicable. If remaining assets of the Corporation legally available
for Distribution to the holders of the Series A’ Preferred Stock or Series AA’ Preferred Stock, as applicable,
after payment to holders of Series B’ Preferred Stock or Series BB’ Preferred Stock, as applicable, of the full
amounts specified in Section 3(a) above are insufficient to permit the payment to the holders of Series A’
Preferred Stock or Series AA’ Preferred Stock, as applicable, of the full amounts specified in this
Section 3(b), then the entire remaining assets of the Corporation legally available for Distribution shall be

holders of the Common Stock and Preferred Stock of the Corporation in proportion to the number of shares of
Common Stock (assuming the conversion of all shares of Preferred Stock into Common Stock) held by them.

(d) Deemed Liquidation Events. For purposes of this Section 3, unless otherwise agreed
by a Preferred Supermajority, a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation shall be deemed to
be occasioned by, or to include, (i) the acquisition of the Corporation by another entity by means of any
transaction or series of related transactions (including, without limitation, any stock acquisition,
reorganization, merger or consolidation but excluding any sale of capital stock of the Corporation for capital
raising purposes) other than a transaction or series of transactions in which the holders of the voting securities
of the Corporation outstanding immediately prior to such transaction continue to retain (either by such voting
securities remaining outstanding or by such voting securities being converted into voting securities of the
surviving entity), as a result of shares in the Corporation held by such holders prior to such transaction, at
least a majority of the total voting power represented by the voting securities of the Corporation or such
surviving entity outstanding immediately after such transaction or series of transactions in relatively the same
proportion as they held prior to the transaction or series of transactions; or (ii) a sale, lease, transfer, exclusive
license or other conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, or the sale or
disposition (whether by merger or otherwise) of one or more subsidiaries of the Corporation if substantially
all of the assets of the Corporation and its subsidiaries taken as a whole are held by such subsidiary or
subsidiaries, except where such sale, lease, transfer, exclusive license or other disposition is to a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Corporation (each of the events described in clauses (i) and (ii) above is referred to as
a “Deemed Liquidation Event”).

(e) Valuation of Non Cash Consideration. If any assets of the Corporation distributed to
stockholders in connection with any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation are other than
cash, then the value of such assets shall be their fair market value as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors, except that unless otherwise valued in a merger or acquisition agreement approved by the
Corporation’s stockholders any publicly traded securities to be distributed to stockholders in a liquidation,
dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation shall be valued as follows:

(i) Ifthe securities are then traded on a national securities exchange or a national
quotation system, then the value of the securities shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the
securities on such exchange or system over the ten (10) trading day period ending five (5) trading days prior
to the Distribution;

(ii) if the securities are actively traded over the counter, then the value of the
securities shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid prices of the securities over the ten (10) trading
day period ending five (5) trading days prior to the Distribution.

In the event of a merger or other acquisition of the Corporation by another entity, the Distribution
date shall be deemed to be the date such transaction closes.

For the purposes of this Section 3(e), “trading day” shall mean any day which the exchange or
system on which the securities to be distributed are traded is open and “closing prices” or “closing bid
prices” shall be deemed to be: (i) for securities traded primarily on the New York Stock Exchange, the
American Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, the last reported trade price or sale price, as the case may be, at
4:00 p.m., New York time, on that day and (ii) for securities listed or traded on other exchanges, markets and
systems, the market price as of the end of the regular hours trading period that is generally accepted as such
for such exchange, market or system. If, after the date hereof, the benchmark times generally accepted in the
securities industry for determining the market price of a stock as of a given trading day shall change from

4767506 4.DOC -5-
those set forth above, the fair market value shall be determined as of such other generally accepted benchmark
times.

4, Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as follows (the
“Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of
the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share at the office of the Corporation or any
transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, into that number of fully paid, nonassessable shares of Common Stock
determined by dividing the Original Issue Price for the relevant series by the Conversion Price for such series.
(The number of shares of Common Stock into which each share of Preferred Stock of a series may be
converted is hereinafter referred to as the “Conversion Rate” for each such series.) Upon any decrease or
increase in the Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock, as described in this Section 4, the
Conversion Rate for such series shall be appropriately increased or decreased.

(b) Automatic Conversion of Preferred Stock. Each share of Preferred Stock shall
automatically be converted into fully paid, non assessable shares of Common Stock at the then effective
Conversion Rate for such share (1) immediately prior to the closing of a firm commitment underwritten
public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the offer and
sale of the Corporation’s Common Stock, provided that the aggregate gross proceeds to the Corporation are
not less than $40,000,000 and the pre money valuation of the Corporation prior to such public offering is not
less than $150,000,000 (a “QIPO”) or (2) upon the receipt by the Corporation of a written request for such
conversion from the holders of a Preferred Supermajority, or, if later, the effective date for conversion
specified in such request (each of the events referred to in (1) and (2) are referred to herein as a “Post
Series B’ Automatic Conversion Event’).

(c) Special Mandatory Conversion. Immediately after the Second Tranche Closing (as
defined in the Series B’ Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement dated on or about August __, 2009, as may be
amended from time to time, by and among the Company and the purchasers of the Company’s Series B’
Preferred Stock set forth on Exhibit A attached thereto (the “Purchase Agreement”)) and immediately
following the Exchange (as defined in the Purchase Agreement), (1) each ten (10) shares of Series A’
Preferred Stock then outstanding shall be automatically converted into one (1) share of Common Stock
subject to adjustment as set forth in this Section 4, and each ten (10) shares of Series B’ Preferred Stock then
outstanding shall be automatically converted into one (1) share of Common Stock subject to adjustment as set
forth in this Section 4, (2) there shall no longer be any shares of Preferred Stock designated as Series A’
Preferred Stock or Series B’ Preferred Stock, (3) the authorized number of shares of Preferred Stock shall be
reduced from Four Hundred Twenty Three Million (423,000,000) shares to Two Hundred Forty Two Million
(242,000,000) shares, (4) the authorized number of shares of Common Stock shall be reduced from Five
Hundred Twenty Seven Million (527,000,000) shares to Three Hundred Four Million (304,000,000) shares
and (5) the total number of shares of capital stock that the Corporation is authorized to issue shall be reduced
from Nine Hundred Forty Nine Million (949,000,000) shares to Five Hundred Forty Six Million
(546,000,000) shares (the “Post Series B’ Special Mandatory Conversion Event’). The holder of any
shares of Series A’ Preferred Stock or Series B’ Preferred Stock converted pursuant to this Section 4(c) shall
deliver to the Corporation during regular business hours at the office of any transfer agent of the Corporation,
or at such other place as may be designated by the Corporation, the certificate or certificates for the shares so
converted, duly endorsed or assigned in blank or to the Corporation. As promptly as practicable thereafter,
the Corporation shall issue and deliver to such holder, at the place designated by such holder, a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of the Common Stock to be issued and such holder shall be deemed to
have become a stockholder of record of Common Stock on the date of the Post Series B’ Special Mandatory
Conversion Event unless the transfer books of the Corporation are closed on that date, in which event he, she

4767506 4.DOC -6-
or it shall be deemed to have become a stockholder of record of Common Stock on the next succeeding date
on which the transfer books are open. Additionally, any shares of Preferred Stock subject to an agreement
pursuant to which the holder of such shares of Preferred Stock agrees that such shares convert into Common
Stock upon the occurrence of certain conditions precedent shall so convert into Common Stock automatically
upon the satisfaction of such conditions precedent. Upon the Post Series B’ Special Mandatory Conversion
Event provided for under this Section 4(c), the shares of Series A’ Preferred Stock and Series B’ Preferred
Stock so converted shall be canceled and shall not be re issuable by the Corporation.

(d) Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued
upon conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would otherwise be
entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the then fair market value of a
share of Common Stock as determined by the Board of Directors. For such purpose, all shares of Preferred
Stock held by each holder of Preferred Stock shall be aggregated, and any resulting fractional share of
Common Stock shall be paid in cash. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the
same into full shares of Common Stock, and to receive certificates therefor, they shall either (A) surrender the
certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for
the Preferred Stock or (B) notify the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost,
stolen or destroyed and execute an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation
from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates, and shall give written notice to the
Corporation at such office that they elect to convert the same; provided, however, that on the date of a Post
Series B’ Automatic Conversion Event or a Post Series B’ Special Mandatory Conversion Event, the
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically without any further action by the
holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the
Corporation or its transfer agent; provided further, however, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to
issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such Post Series B’ Automatic
Conversion Event or a Post Series B’ Special Mandatory Conversion Event, as the case may be, unless either
the certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent
as provided above, or the holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been
lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the
Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates. On the date of the occurrence
of a Post Series B’ Automatic Conversion Event or Post Series B’ Special Mandatory Conversion Event, as
the case may be, each holder of record of shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to be the holder of record
of the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, notwithstanding that the certificates representing such
shares of Preferred Stock shall not have been surrendered at the office of the Corporation, that notice from the
Corporation shall not have been received by any holder of record of shares of Preferred Stock, or that the
certificates evidencing such shares of Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered to such holder.

The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after such delivery, or after such agreement and
indemnification, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, a certificate or certificates
for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid and a check
payable to the holder in the amount of any cash amounts payable as the result of a conversion into fractional
shares of Common Stock, plus any declared and unpaid dividends on the converted Preferred Stock. Such
conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such
surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder
or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date; provided, however, that if the conversion is in
connection with an underwritten offer of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act or a Deemed
Liquidation Event, the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering Preferred Stock for conversion,
be conditioned upon the closing of such transaction, in which event the person(s) entitled to receive the

4767506_4,DOC -J-
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted
such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such transaction.

on the date of, and immediately prior to such issue, for such series of Preferred Stock.

(iii) Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Filing Date shall issue any Options or Convertible
Securities or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to
receive any such Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of shares (as set forth in the
instrument relating thereto without regard to any provisions contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of
such number) of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case of Convertible
Securities, the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities or, in the case of Options for
Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options and the conversion or exchange of the underlying
securities, shall be deemed to have been issued as of the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shall
have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, provided that in any such case in which
shares are deemed to be issued:

(1) no further adjustment in the Conversion Price of any series of
Preferred Stock shall be made upon the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities or shares of Common
Stock in connection with the exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities;

(2) if such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms provide, with
the passage of time or otherwise, for any change in the consideration payable to the Corporation or in the
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange thereof (other than a
change pursuant to the anti dilution provisions of such Options or Convertible Securities such as this
Section 4(e) or pursuant to Recapitalization provisions of such Options or Convertible Securities such as

4767506 4.DOC 9.
Sections 4(f}, 4(g), 4ch) and 4(4) hereof), then upon such change the Conversion Price of each series of
Preferred Stock and any subsequent adjustments based thereon shall be recomputed to reflect such change as
if such change had been in effect as of the original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of the record date
with respect thereto);

(3) no readjustment pursuant to clause (2) above shall have the effect of
increasing the Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock to an amount above the Conversion Price that
would have resulted from any other issuances of Additional Shares of Common and any other adjustments
provided for herein between the original adjustment date and such readjustment date;

(4) upon the expiration of any such Options or any rights of conversion
or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have been exercised, the Conversion Price of
each series of Preferred Stock computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record
date with respect thereto) and any subsequent adjustments based thereon shall, upon such expiration, be
recomputed as if:

(a) in the case of Convertible Securities or Options for Common
Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common issued were the shares of Common Stock, if any, actually
issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities and the
consideration received therefor was the consideration actually received by the Corporation for the issue of
such exercised Options plus the consideration actually received by the Corporation upon such exercise or for
the issue of all such Convertible Securities which were actually converted or exchanged, plus the additional
consideration, if any, actually received by the Corporation upon such conversion or exchange, and

(b) in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, only the
Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were issued at the time of issue of
such Options, and the consideration received by the Corporation for the Additional Shares of Common
deemed to have been then issued was the consideration actually received by the Corporation for the issue of
such exercised Options, plus the consideration deemed to have been received by the Corporation (determined
pursuant to Section 4(e)(v)) upon the issue of the Convertible Securities with respect to which such Options
were actually exercised; and

(5) if such record date shall have been fixed and such Options or
Convertible Securities are not issued on the date fixed therefor, the adjustment previously made in the
Conversion Price which became effective on such record date shall be canceled as of the close of business on
such record date, and thereafter the Conversion Price shal! be adjusted pursuant to this Section 4(e)(iii) as of
the actual date of their issuance.

(iv) Adjustment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional Shares of
Common. In the event that after the date of filing of this Certificate of Incorporation, this Corporation shall

issue Additional Shares of Common (including Additional Shares of Common deemed to be issued pursuant
to Section 4(e)(iii)) without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the applicable Conversion
Price of a series of Preferred Stock in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such issue, then, the
Conversion Price of the affected series of Preferred Stock shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a
price (calculated to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the
numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such
issue plus the number of shares which the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for the total
number of Additional Shares of Common so issued would purchase at such Conversion Price, and the
denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such
issue plus the number of such Additional Shares of Common so issued. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the

4767506_4.DOC -10-
Conversion Price shall not be reduced at such time if the amount of such reduction would be less than $0.01;
provided, however, that such reduction shall be included in the next issuance of Additional Shares of
Common. For the purposes of this Section 4(e)(iv), all shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of
all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock and the exercise and/or conversion of any other outstanding
Convertible Securities and all outstanding Options at the time of the issuance of Additional Shares of
Common shall be deemed to be outstanding.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this Section 4(e), the
consideration received by the Corporation for the issue (or deemed issue) of any Additional Shares of
Common shall be computed as follows:

65) Cash and Property. Such consideration shall:

(a) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the aggregate
amount of cash received by the Corporation after deducting any reasonable discounts, commissions or other
expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the Corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with
such issuance;

(b) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair market value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith by the Board
of Directors; and

(c) in the event Additional Shares of Common are issued
together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for consideration which covers both,
be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in clauses (a) and (b) above, as
reasonably determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(2) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per share

received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common deemed to have been issued pursuant to
Section 4(e)(iii) shall be determined by dividing

(x) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the
Corporation as consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the minimum
ageregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard
to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration) payable to the
Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities,
or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities
and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities by

(y) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set
forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent
adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities.

(H Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of Common Stock. In the event the
outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided (by stock split, by payment of a stock dividend or
otherwise), into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price of each series of
Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of
such subdivision, be proportionately decreased. In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall
be combined (by reclassification or otherwise) into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, the

4767506 _4.DOC -1]-
Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such combination shall,
concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination, be proportionately increased.

(g) Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of Preferred Stock. In the event the
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock or a series of Preferred Stock shall be subdivided (by stock split, by

payment of a stock dividend or otherwise), into a greater number of shares of Preferred Stock, the Dividend
Rate, Original Issue Price, Conversion Price and Liquidation Preference of the affected series of Preferred
Stock in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such
subdivision, be proportionately decreased. In the event the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock or a series
of Preferred Stock shall be combined (by reclassification or otherwise) into a lesser number of shares of
Preferred Stock, the Dividend Rate, Original Issue Price, Conversion Price and Liquidation Preference of the
affected series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such combination shall, concurrently with the
effectiveness of such combination, be proportionately increased.

(h) Adjustment for Other Distributions. In the event the Corporation at any time or from
time to time after the Filing Date makes or fixes a record date for the determination of holders of Common
Stock entitled to receive any Distribution payable in securities of the Corporation or any other property, then
and in each such event provision shall be made so that the holders of Preferred Stock shall receive upon such
Distribution the amount of securities of the Corporation or other property which they would have received
had their Preferred Stock converted into Common Stock on the date of such event and had they thereafter,
during the period from the date of such event to and including the date of conversion, retained such securities
or other property receivable by them as aforesaid during such period, subject to all other adjustments called
for during such pericd under this Section 4 with respect to the rights of the holders of Preferred Stock.

(i) Adjustments for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. Subject to Section 3
above, if at any time or from time to time, the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred

Stock shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock,
whether by recapitalization, capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision,
combination of shares or merger, sale of assets or other event provided for above or in Section 3), then, in any
such event, in lieu of the number of shares of Common Stock which the holders would otherwise have been
entitled to receive, each holder of such Preferred Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such shares of
Preferred Stock into a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock which a holder of the number
of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of such series of Preferred Stock immediately before
that change would have been entitled to receive in such recapitalization, capital reorganization,
reclassification or otherwise, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein with respect to such other
shares. In addition, to the extent applicable in any recapitalization, capital reorganization, reclassification or
otherwise, provision shall be made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to
receive upon conversion of the Preferred Stock the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of
the Corporation or otherwise, to which a holder of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion would have
been entitled on such recapitalization, capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise.

(j) Certificate _as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation at its expense shall promptly
compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to each holder of
Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detai! the facts
upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon the written request at any
time of any holder of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting
forth (i) such adjustments and readjustments, (ii) the Conversion Price at the time in effect and (iii) the
number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be
received upon the conversion of Preferred Stock.

4767506_4.D0C -12-
(k) Waiver of Adjustment of Conversion Price. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, any downward adjustment of the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock may be waived,
either prospectively or retroactively and either generally or in a particular instance, by the consent or vote of
the holders of at least sixty six and two thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the then outstanding shares of such series.
Any such waiver shall bind all future holders of shares of such series of Preferred Stock.

() Notices of Record Date. In the event that this Corporation shall propose at any time:

(i) to declare any dividend or Distribution upon its Common Stock, whether in
cash, property, stock or other securities, whether or not a regular cash dividend and whether or not out of
earnings or earned surplus;

(ii) to effect any reclassification or recapitalization of its Common Stock
outstanding involving a change in the Common Stock; or

(iii) ~—- to voluntarily liquidate or dissolve or to enter into any Deemed Liquidation
Event;

then, in connection with each such event, this Corporation shall send to the holders of the Preferred Stock at
least 10 days’ prior written notice of the date on which a record shall be taken for such dividend or
Distribution (and specifying the date on which the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled thereto) or for
determining rights to vote in respect of the matters referred to in (ii) and (iii) above.

Such written notice shall be given by first class mail (or express courier), postage prepaid, addressed
to the holders of Preferred Stock at the address for each such holder as shown on the books of the Corporation
and shall be deemed given on the date such notice is mailed.

The notice provisions set forth in this Section may be shortened or waived prospectively or
retrospectively by the vote or written consent of the holders of a Preferred Supermajority.

(m) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at all times
reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock solely for the purpose
of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock, such number of its shares of Common Stock
as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred
Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shal! not be
sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation will
take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but
unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.

5, Voting.

(a) Restricted Class Voting. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or as
required by law, the holders of Preferred Stock and the holders of Common Stock shall vote together and not
as separate classes.

(b) No Series Voting. Other than as provided herein or required by law, there shall be no
series voting.

(c) Preferred Stock. Each holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to the number of
votes equal to the number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Preferred Stock held by such

4767506_4.DOC -|3-
holder could be converted immediately after the close of business on the record date fixed for a stockholders
meeting or the effective date of a written consent. The holders of shares of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
vote on all matters on which the Common Stock shall be entitled to vote and may act by written consent in the
same manner as the Common Stock. Holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to notice of any
stockholders’ meeting in accordance with the Bylaws of the Corporation. Fractional votes shall not, however,
be permitted and any fractional voting rights resulting from the above formula (after aggregating all shares
into which shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder could be converted), shall be disregarded.

(d) Election of Directors. The holders of Series A’ Preferred Stock or Series AA’
Preferred Stock, as applicable, voting as a separate class, either by written consent or at a special meeting,
shall be entitled to elect two (2) members of the Corporation’s Board of Directors at each meeting or pursuant
to each consent of the Corporation’s stockholders for the election of directors and to remove from office such
director(s) and to fill any vacancy caused by the resignation, death or removal of such director(s). The
holders of Series B’ Preferred Stock or Series BB’ Preferred Stock, as applicable, voting as a separate class,
either by written consent or at a special meeting, shall be entitled to elect two (2) members of the
Corporation’s Board of Directors at each meeting or pursuant to each consent of the Corporation’s
stockholders for the election of directors and to remove from office such director and to fill any vacancy
caused by the resignation, death or removal of such director. Any additional members of the Corporation’s
Board of Directors shall be elected by the mutual consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
Common Stock and Preferred Stock (determined on an as converted to Common Stock basis), voting together
as a single class. If the holders of shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock, as the case may be, fail to
elect a sufficient number of directors to fill all directorships for which they are entitled to elect directors,
voting exclusively and as a separate class, pursuant to the first three sentences of this Section 5(d), then any
directorship not so filied shall remain vacant (unless otherwise earlier filled pursuant to the applicable
provisions of the Corporation’s bylaws) until such time as the holders of the Preferred Stock or Common
Stock, as the case may be, elect a person to fill such directorship by vote or written consent in lieu of a
meeting; and no such directorship may be filled by stockholders of the Corporation other than by the
stockholders of the Corporation that are entitled to elect a person to fill such directorship, voting exclusively
and as a separate class.

(e) Common Stock. Each holder of shares of Common Stock shal! be entitled to one
vote for each share thereof held. The number of authorized shares of Common Stock may be increased or
decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by (in addition to any vote of the
holders of one or more series of Preferred Stock that may be required by the terms of the Certificate of
Incorporation) the affirmative vote of the holders of shares of capital stock of the Corporation representing a
majority of the votes represented by all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote,
irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.

(f) Cumulative Voting. So long as Section 2115 of the California General Corporation
Law purports to make Section 708 subdivisions (a), (b) and (c) of the California General Corporation Law
applicable to the Corporation, the Corporation’s stockholders shall have the right to cumulate their votes in
connection with the election of directors as provided by Section 708 subdivisions (a), (b) and (c) of the
California General Corporation Law.
