Preferred Stock being treated for this purpose as holding the number of shares of Common Stock
into which such holder could have converted such holder’s shares of Preferred Stock

immediately prior to such event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up pursuant to the
provisions of Section 3).

(111) | Upon conversion of shares of Preferred Stock into shares of
Common Stock pursuant to Section 3, the holder of such Common Stock shall not be entitled to
any preferential payment or distribution in case of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of

complementary with the business of the Corporation and which does not involve a
recapitalization or reorganization of the Preferred Stock or Common Stock, and does not involve
(in a single transaction or series of related transactions) a transfer of more than 49.9% of the
voting power of the Corporation), or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Corporation (other than to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation), shall be deemed to be

the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (electing as a
single class on an as-converted basis) elect to the contrary by giving written notice thereof to the
Corporation at least three (3) days before the effective date of such event. If such notice is given,
the provisions of Section 3(g) shall apply. The amount deemed distributed to the holders of
Preferred Stock upon any such merger or consolidation or sale shall be the cash or the value of
the property, rights or securities distributed to such holders by the acquiring person, firm or other

entity. The value of such property, rights or other securities shall be determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors.

(d) Notice and Opportunity to Exercise Conversion Rights. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary that may be inferred from the provisions of this Section 2, each holder of
shares of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive notice from the Corporation pursuant to
Section 6(c) hereof of any proposed liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation at
least ten (10) days prior to date on which any such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the

B3385505.3
Corporation is scheduled to occur and, at any time prior to any such liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation to convert any or all of such holder’s shares of Preferred Stock
into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 3 hereof.

3, Conversion. The holders of Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as
follows: ~ .

(a) Right to Convert; Conversion Prices. Each share of Preferred Stock shall
be convertible, without the payment of any additional consideration by the holder thereof and at
the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share, at the office
of the Corporation or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, into such number of fully paid
and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the applicable Purchase
Price by the applicable Conversion Price, determined as hereinafter provided, in effect at the
time of conversion. The Conversion Prices shall initially be $0.1214 per share of Series A
Preferred Stock (the ‘Series A Conversion Price”) and $0.77 per share of Series B Preferred
Stock (the “Series B Conversion Price”). The initial Conversion Prices shall be subject to
adjustment, in order to adjust the number of shares of Common Stock into which shares of each
series of Preferred Stock are convertible, as hereinafter provided.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically
be converted into shares of Common Stock at the then effective Conversion Price for each series
of Preferred Stock upon (i) the written election of holders of at least a majority of the then
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (electing as a single class on an as-converted basis) (such
election hereinafter referred to as an “Automatic Conversion Election’) or (ii) the closing of a
public offering, underwritten on a firm commitment basis by an investment banking firm
pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
covering the offer and sale of Common Stock for the account of the Corporation to the public at
an initial price per share of Common Stock of not less than $2.00 (subject to equitable
adjustment in the event of any stock split, stock dividend, combination, reclassification of shares
or other similar event) and with net proceeds to the Corporation of not less than $50,000,000 (a
“Qualifying Initial Public Offering’). In the event of a Qualifying Initial Public Offering, the
person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of the Preferred
Stock shall not be deemed to have converted their Preferred Stock until the closing of the
Qualifying Initial Public Offering.

Upon the effective date of an Automatic Conversion Election or the closing of the
Qualifying Initial Public Offering, all shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically
without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates
representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent; provided,
however, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion unless certificates evidencing such shares of the
Preferred Stock being converted are either delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent, or
the holder of such shares notifies the Corporation or any transfer agent that such certificates have
been lost, stolen, or destroyed and executes an agreement reasonably satisfactory to the
Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection therewith.
Upon the automatic conversion of Preferred Stock, the holders of such Preferred Stock shall
surrender the certificates representing such shares at the office of the Corporation or of its

B3385505.3
transfer agent. Thereupon, there shall be issued and delivered to such holder, promptly at such
office and in his name as shown on such surrendered certificate or certificates, a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of the Preferred
Stock surrendered were convertible on the date on which such automatic conversion occurred,
together with cash in lieu of any fraction of a share as provided below and all dividends declared
but unpaid on such shares of Preferred Stock (but not including any accrued yet undeclared
dividends on such shares of Preferred Stock). No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be
issued upon conversion of the Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the
holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction
multiplied by the then effective Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to convert the same into full shares of Common Stock, other than pursuant to Section
3(b), such holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed for transfer
or with duly executed stock transfer powers sufficient to permit transfer attached, at the office of
the Corporation or of any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock (or such holder shall notify the
Corporation or any transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and
shall execute an agreement reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the
Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection therewith), and shall give written notice
to the Corporation at such office that such holder clects to convert the same and shall state
therein such holder’s name or the name or names of such holder’s nominees in which such
holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued. No
fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of the Preferred Stock. In
lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation
shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the then effective Conversion Price for such
series of Preferred Stock. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and
deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to such holder’s nominee or nominees,
a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall
be entitled as aforesaid, together with cash in lieu of any fraction of a share and all dividends
declared but unpaid on such shares of Preferred Stock (but not including any accrued yet
undeclared dividends on such shares of Preferred Stock). Such conversion shall be deemed to
have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the
certificates for the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled
to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion shall be treated for all purposes
as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date.

occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon,
shall, upon such expiration, be recomputed as if:

(1) in the case of Convertible Securities or
Options for Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common Stock issued were the

conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, and the consideration received therefor
was the consideration actually received by the Corporation for the issue of all such Options,
whether or not exercised, plus the consideration actually received by the Corporation upon such
exercise, or for the issue of all such Convertible Securities which were actually converted or
exchanged, plus the additional consideration, if any, actually received by the Corporation upon
such conversion or exchange; and

(Il) in the case of Options for Convertible
Securities, only the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were

the Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been then issued was the consideration
actually received by the Corporation for the issue of all such Options, whether or not exercised,
plus the consideration deemed to have been received by the Corporation (determined pursuant to
Section 3(d)(v)) upon the issue of the Convertible Securities with respect to which such Options
were actually exercised;

class of securities entitled to receive such dividend or distribution, or

B3385505.3
(B) inthe case of any such subdivision, at the close of
business on the date immediately prior to the date upon which such corporate action becomes

paid on the date fixed therefor, the adjustment previously made in the Conversion Price of such
series of Preferred Stock which became effective on such record date shall be cancelled as of the
close of business on such record date, and thereafter the Conversion Price of such series of
Preferred Stock shall be adjusted pursuant to this Section 3(d)(iii) as of the time of actual
payment of such dividend.

Conversion Price in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such issue or sale, then and in
such event, the Series B Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a
price (calculated to the nearest cent) determined in accordance with the following formula:

Conversion Price shall be made by the operation of this Section 3(d)(iv), and (2) the Series B

Stock shall be computed as follows:

(A) _ insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
aggregate amounts of cash received by the Corporation excluding amounts paid or payable for
accrued interest or accrued dividends;

(B) _ insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair value thereof at the time of such issue or sale, as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors; and

(C) in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock
are issued together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for

share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been
issued pursuant to Section 3(d)(iii)(1) relating to Options and Convertible Securities shall be
determined by dividing (x) the total amount, if any, received or receivable as consideration for
the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities plus the minimum aggregate amount of
additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any
provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration) payable to the
Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such
Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities

the record date or effectiveness, as the case may be, of such dividend, distribution or subdivision
shall, concurrently with such record date or effectiveness, be proportionately decreased.

(2) Combinations or Consolidations. In the event the
outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined or consolidated (by reclassification or
otherwise) into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price of each series
of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such combination or consolidation shall,
concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination or consolidation, be proportionately
increased.

(e) Adjustments for Certain Dividends and Distributions. In the event that at
any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date, the Corporation shall make or issue,
or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a
dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the Corporation other than shares of
Common Stock, then and in each such event provision shall be made so that the holders of
Preferred Stock shall receive upon conversion thereof in addition to the number of shares of
Common Stock receivable thereupon, the amount of securities of the Corporation that they
would have received had their Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock on the date of
such event and had they thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to and including
the conversion date, retained such securities receivable by them as aforesaid during such period,
giving application during such period to all adjustments called for herein.

(f) Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange, or Substitution. In the event
that at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date, the Common Stock issuable
upon the conversion of Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or a different number of
shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification, or
otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares or stock dividend provided for
above, or a merger, consolidation or sale of assets provided for below), then and in each such
event the holder of each such share of Preferred Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert
such share into the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property
reccivable upon such reorganization, reclassification or other change, by a holder of the number
of shares of Common Stock into which such share of Preferred Stock might have been converted
immediately prior to such reorganization, reclassification or change, all subject to further
adjustment as provided herein.

(g) Adjustment for Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets. In the event that
at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date, the Corporation shall merge or
consolidate with or into another entity or sell all or substantially all of its assets (other than a
consolidation, merger or sale which is treated as a liquidation pursuant to Section 2(c)), each
share of Preferred Stock shall thereafter be convertible into the kind and amount of shares of
stock or other securities or property to which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock
of the Corporation deliverable upon conversion of such Preferred Stock would have been entitled

B3385505.3

~
upon such consolidation, merger or sale; and, in such case, appropriate adjustment (as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) shall be made in the application of the
provisions in this Section 3 set forth with respect to the rights and interest thereafter of the
holders of Preferred Stock, to the end that the provisions set forth in this Section 3 (including
provisions with respect to changes in and other adjustments of the Conversion Price of each
series of Preferred Stock) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in
relation to any shares of stock or other property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of the
Preferred Stock.

(h) Waiver of Anti-dilution Protection. To the extent that the provisions of
Sections 3(d), 3(e), 3(f) and 3(g) apply to Series A Preferred Stock, such provisions may be
waived for all the shares of Series A Preferred Stock by the written consent of the holders of at
least a majority in voting power of shares of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding. To the
extent that the provisions of Sections 3(d), 3(e), 3(f) and 3(g) apply to Series B Preferred Stock,
such provisions may be waived for all the shares of Series B Preferred Stock by the written
consent of the holders of at least a majority in voting power of shares of Series B Preferred Stock
then outstanding. For the purposes of this Section 3(h), a waiver on one occasion shall not
constitute a waiver on any further occasion.

(i) No Impairment. The Corporation shall not, by amendment of its
Certificate of Incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation,
merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to
avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder
by the Corporation but shall at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the
provisions of this Section 3 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or
appropriate in order to protect against impairment the rights of the holders of Preferred Stock to
convert any or all of such holders’ shares of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock
pursuant to Section 3 hereof.

(j) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 3,
the Corporation at its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in
accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to each affected holder of such series of Preferred
Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts
upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon the written
request at any time of any affected holder of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to
such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and readjustments, (ii) the
Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock at the time in effect, and (iii) the number of
shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be
received upon the conversion of each share of such series of Preferred Stock.

(k) Notices of Record Date. In the event of any taking by the Corporation of a
record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof
who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend which is the same as cash
dividends paid in previous quarters) or other distribution, the Corporation shall mail to each
holder of Preferred Stock at least ten (10) days prior to such record date a notice specifying the
date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend or distribution.

B3385505.3
13
(i) Common Stock Reserved. The Corporation shall reserve and keep
available out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock such number of shares of Common
Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect conversion of the Preferred Stock.

(m) Certain Taxes. The Corporation shall pay any issue or transfer taxes
payable in connection with the conversion of Preferred Stock; provided, however, that the
Corporation shall not be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer
to a name other than that of the holder of Preferred Stock.

(n) Closing of Books. The Corporation shall at no time close its transfer
books against the transfer of any Preferred Stock or of any shares of Common Stock issued or
issuable upon the conversion of any shares of Preferred Stock in any manner which interferes
with the timely conversion or transfer of such Preferred Stock or Common Stock, except as may
otherwise be required by applicable law.

4, Voting Rights.

(a) Except as otherwise required by law or set forth in this Certificate of
Incorporation, the holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to notice of any meeting of
stockholders and shall vote with the holders of Common Stock as a single class upon any matter
submitted to the stockholders for a vote. With respect to all questions as to which, under law,
stockholders are required to vote by classes, all Preferred Stock shall vote separately as a single
class apart from the Common Stock, and with respect to al] questions as to which, under law,
stockholders are required to vote by series, each series of Preferred Stock shall vote separately as
a single class and series apart from each other series and from the Common Stock. Shares of
Common Stock and Preferred Stock shall entitle the holders thereof to the following number of
votes on any matter as to which they are entitled to vote:

(i) Holders of Common Stock shall have one vote per share; and

(ii) Holders of Preferred Stock shall have that number of votes per
share as is equal to the number of shares of Common Stock (including fractions of a share) into
which each such share of Preferred Stock held by such holder could be converted on the date for
determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting or on the date of any written
consent.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, notwithstanding the provisions
of Section 242(b)(2) of the Delaware General Corporation Law and subject to any additional
consent requirements as may be established in the terms of any series of Preferred Stock, the
number of authorized shares of Common Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the
number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of
Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Common Stock, voting as one class in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 4.

(b) = At all times during which at least 1,400,000 shares of Series A Preferred
Stock remain outstanding (such amount subject to equitable adjustment in the event of any stock
split, stock dividend, combination, reclassification of shares or other similar event), the holders

B3385505.3
14
of a majority of such outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have the exclusive
right, voting separately from the Series B Preferred Stock and the Common Stock, to elect one
director of the Corporation (such director the “Series A Director”), the designation of such Series
A Director to be governed by any voting agreement or similar arrangement to which the holders
of Series A Preferred Stock may from time to time be party. Any Series A Director may be
removed, with or without cause, and a replacement Series A Director may be elected in his or her
stead, at any time only by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Series A Preferred Stock.

(c) At all times during which at least 3,200,000 shares of Series B Preferred
Stock remain outstanding (such amount subject to equitable adjustment in the event of any stock
split, stock dividend, combination, reclassification of shares or other similar event), the holders
of a majority of such outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall have the exclusive
right, voting separately from the Series A Preferred Stock and the Common Stock, to elect four
directors of the Corporation (each such director a “Series B Director”), the designation of any
such Series B Director to be governed by any voting agreement or similar arrangement to which
the holders of Series B Preferred Stock may from time to time be party (each Series B Director,
Series A Director and other director designated by a holder of Preferred Stock pursuant to any
voting agreement or similar agreement to which the Corporation is a party). Any Series B
Director may be removed, with or without cause, and a replacement Series B Director may be
elected in his or her stead, at any time only by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of
the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock voting in accordance with any voting
agreement or similar arrangement to which the holders of Series B Preferred Stock may from
time to time be party. The presence of at least one Series B Director shall be required to
establish a quorum for a meeting of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof of which
one or more Series B Directors are members.

(d) | Notwithstanding any provision of the By-laws of the Corporation to the
contrary, the number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors shall be fixed at nine
and may only be changed by the affirmative vote or written consent of (i) the holders of at least a
majority of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock voting or consenting, as the case may be,
separately from the Common Stock, and (ii) the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
of Common Stock voting or consenting, as the case may be, separately from the Preferred Stock,
or in accordance with the terms of any voting agreement or similar arrangement to which the
holders of Preferred Stock may from time to time be party. The Board of Directors shall not
delegate any of its powers or duties to any committee of the Board of Directors without the
affirmative consent or vote of all Series B Directors.

5. Redemption.

(a) At the written election of the holders of at least ten percent (10%) in
voting power of the then outstanding Series B Preferred Stock made not less than thirty (30) days
prior to each of August 7, 2010, 2011 and 2012, the Corporation shall call for redemption, and
shall redeem from each of such holders on a date not later than sixty (60) days after whichever
August 7 shall be applicable (each such date a “Redemption Date’) up to thirty-three and one-
third percent (33 1/3%) of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock held by such holder on August
7, 2010 (the “Maximum Annual Redemption Amount”). In the event that any shares of Series B

B3385505.3
15
Preferred Stock are transferred after the first Redemption Date, the right to elect redemption on
any subsequent Redemption Date, up to the pro rata Maximum Annual Redemption Amount
applicable thereto, shall automatically be transferred with such shares to the transferee. If at the
time of an election made with respect to the last such Redemption Date any electing holder
desires to require the Corporation to redeem more than the applicable Maximum Annual
Redemption Amount of shares of Series B Preferred Stock, then the written election of such
holder shall include the total number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock the holder desires to
have redeemed. Shares covered by such election in excess of such holder’s Maximum Annual
Redemption Amount shall be redeemed by the Corporation on the first anniversary of the last
such Redemption Date, up to the Maximum Annual Redemption Amount, and any balance of
shares of Series B Preferred Stock as to which redemption has been elected will be redeemed by
the Corporation on the second anniversary of such last Redemption Date (each of such
anniversaries hereinafter also referred to as a “Redemption Date”). All shares of Series B
Preferred Stock to be redeemed as provided above shall be redeemed at a redemption price per
share equal to the Purchase Price for the Series B Preterred Stock (which amount shall be subject
to equitable adjustment whenever there shall occur a stock dividend, distribution, combination of
shares, reclassification of shares or other similar event) plus all dividends accrued or declared but
unpaid thereon, to and including the date full payment shall be tendered to the holders of the
Series B Preferred Stock with respect to each such installment.

(b) Notice of redemption shall be sent by first class mail, postage prepaid, to
each holder of record of Series B Preferred Stock to be redeemed, not less than thirty (30) days
nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the Redemption Date set forth therein, at the address of
such holder as it appears on the books of the Corporation. Such notice shall set forth (i) the date
and place of redemption; and (ii) the number of shares to be redeemed and the redemption price,
including all dividends declared or accrued but unpaid to the Redemption Date. In the event that
a notice of redemption is given under this Section 5(b), the Corporation shall be obligated to
redeem the Series B Preferred Stock on the date and in the amounts set forth in the notice. The
Corporation, if advised before the close of business on the relevant Redemption Date by written
notice from any holder of record of Series B Preferred Stock to be redeemed, shall credit against
the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock required to be redeemed from such holder, and
shall not redeem, the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock which had been converted by

such holder on or before such date and which had not previously been credited against any
redemption.

(c) If, on or before a Redemption Date, the funds necessary for such
redemption shall have been set aside by the Corporation and deposited with a bank or trust
company, in trust for the pro rata benefit of the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock that has
been called for redemption, then, notwithstanding that any certificates for shares that have been
called for redemption shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, the shares represented
thereby shall no longer be deemed outstanding from and after such Redemption Date, and all
rights of holders of such shares so called for redemption shall forthwith, after such Redemption
Date, cease and terminate with respect to such shares, excepting only the right to receive the
redemption funds therefor to which they are entitled, but without interest. Any interest accrued
on funds so deposited and unclaimed by stockholders entitled thereto shall be paid to such
stockholders at the time their respective shares are redeemed or to the Corporation at the time
unclaimed amounts are paid to it. In case the holders of Series B Preferred Stock which shall

B3385505.3
16
have been called for redemption shall not, within six (6) years after the final Redemption Date,
claim the amounts so deposited with respect to the redemption thereof, any such bank or trust
company shall, upon demand, pay over to the Corporation such unclaimed amounts and
thereupon such bank or trust company shall be relieved of all responsibility in respect thereof to
such holder and such holder shall look only to the Corporation for the payment thereof. Any
funds so deposited with a bank or trust company which shall not be required for such redemption
by reason of the exercise subsequent to the date of such deposit of the right of conversion of any
shares or otherwise shall be returned to the Corporation forthwith.

(d) If the Corporation for any reason fails to redeem any of the shares of
Series B Preferred Stock in accordance with this Section 5 on or prior to the Redemption Dates
determined in accordance herewith, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Certificate of Incorporation:

(i) The Corporation may not incur any indebtedness for money
borrowed (unless the proceeds of such incurrence of indebtedness are used to make all overdue
redemptions) or borrow or reborrow any amounts under any lines of credit which it may then
have outstanding without the prior written consent of the holders of at least a majority of the then
outstanding shares of the Series B Preferred Stock;

(ii) | Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or
in any contract or agreement to which the Corporation is a party, the number of directors
constituting the Board of Directors shall be increased by two and the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall have the right, by written consent or at any
special or annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, voting together as a separate
class to the exclusion of Series A Preferred Stock and Common Stock, to elect two directors of
the Corporation to fill such newly created directorships. In the event that upon such failure to
redeem the holders of Series B Preferred Stock do not have the right pursuant to Section 4(c) to
elect four directors as Series B Directors, then in addition to and not in lieu of the increase by
two in the number of directors and the right to elect the same as provided above, the number of
directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be further increased by six and the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall have the right, by written
consent or at any special or annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, voting
together as a separate class to the exclusion of Series A Preferred Stock and Common Stock, to
elect six directors of the Corporation to fill such newly created directorships. Such rights shall
continue until the Corporation is no longer in default of its obligation to redeem shares of Series
B Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 5. Each director elected by the holders of shares of
any Series B Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 5(d)(ii) (each, an “Additional Series B
Director”) shall continue to serve as such director for the full term for which he or she shall have
been elected, notwithstanding that prior to the end of such term a default under this Section 5
shall cease to exist. Any Additional Series B Director may be removed by, and shall not be
removed except by, the written consent or vote of the holders of record of at least a majority of
the outstanding shares of the Series B Preferred Stock entitled to have originally voted for such
director’s election, voting together as a separate class to the exclusion of Series A Preferred
Stock and Common Stock. As long as a default under this Section 5 shall exist, any vacancy in
the office of an Additional Series B Director shall be filled by the vote or written consent of the
holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series B Preferred Stock entitled to

B3385505.3
17
have originally voted for the removed director’s election, voting together as a separate class to
the exclusion of Series A Preferred Stock and Common Stock; and

(iii) | The holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive,
when and if declared by the Board of Directors, out of funds legally available for the payment of
dividends, annual dividends in cash (the “Additional Dividends”) at the rate of eight percent
(8%) per share per annum of the Purchase Price for the Series B Preferred Stock (as defined
below, which amount shall be subject to equitable adjustment whenever there shall occur a stock
dividend, stock split, combination of shares, reclassification of shares or other similar event),
which Additional Dividends are in addition to, and not in lieu of, the dividends on the Series B
Preferred Stock provided for in Section 1(b). The Additional Dividends shall accrue from day to
day on each share of Series B Preferred Stock from the date on which the Corporation was
required by this Section 5 to redeem such share but failed to do so as long as a default under this
Section 5 shall exist, whether or not earned or declared, and shall be cumulative.

(e) If the funds of the Corporation legally available for redemption of shares
of Series B Preferred Stock on a Redemption Date are insufficient to redeem the total number of
shares of Series B Preferred Stock submitted for redemption, those funds which are legally
available will be used to redeem the maximum possible number of whole shares ratably among
the holders of such shares. The shares of Series B Preferred Stock not redeemed shall remain
outstanding and entitled to all rights and preferences provided herein. At any time thereafter
when additional funds of the Corporation are legally available for the redemption of such shares
of Series B Preferred Stock, such funds will be used, at the end of the next succeeding fiscal
quarter, to redeem the balance of such shares, or such portion thereof for which funds are then
legally available.

6. Covenants.

(a) As long as any shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be outstanding, the
Corporation shall not, without first having provided the written notice of such proposed action to
each holder of outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock required by Section 6(c) and
having obtained the affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of not less than a majority
in voting power of the then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, with cach share of
Series A Preferred Stock entitling the holder thereof to that number of votes per share as is equal

Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely;

(vi) amend the Corporation’s Certificate of Incorporation;

(vii) effect any sale, lease, assignment, transfer, license or other
conveyance (other than the grant of a mortgage or security interest in connection with

of its subsidiaries, any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of, or any consolidation or merger
involving, the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries or any recapitalization of the Corporation,

consolidation, sale, lease or other disposition of assets, beneficially own at least 50% of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, the surviving or acquiring
corporation or entity, calculated on a fully-diluted basis: or

(viii) pay or declare any dividend or distribution on any shares of
Common Stock or Preferred Stock, or apply any of the Corporation’s assets to the redemption,
retirement, purchase or other acquisition, directly or indirectly, through subsidiaries or otherwise,
of any shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock (except for (1) the repurchase each calendar
year of shares of Common Stock having an aggregate purchase price of no more than $100,000,

Corporation upon termination of their status as such pursuant to an agreement containing vesting
and/or repurchase provisions approved by the Board of Directors (including in such approval all
of the Preferred Stock Directors), (3) redemptions pursuant to the redemption rights provided for
in Section 5, or (4) any repurchase pursuant to the put rights of the registered holder of the
Cephas Warrant, as provided by Section 4 of the Cephas Warrant);

B3385505.3
(c) Any other provision of the Corporation’s Certificate of Incorporation or
By-laws to the contrary notwithstanding, notice of any action specified in Section 6(a) or 6(b)
shall be given by the Corporation to each holder of outstanding shares of that series of Preferred
Stock whose affirmative vote or written consent is required by Section 6(a) or 6(b), by overnight
_ delivery or first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to such holder at the last address of such
holder as shown by the records of the Corporation, at least ten (10) days before the date on which
the books of the Corporation shall close or a record shall be taken with respect to such proposed
action, or, if there shall be no such date, at least ten (10) days before the date when such
proposed action is scheduled to occur. Any holder of outstanding shares of Preferred Stock may
waive any notice required by this Section 6(c) by a written document indicating such waiver, and
such holders of Preferred Stock as shall have the right, pursuant to this Section 6, to approve
such proposed action may effect a written waiver on behalf of all the holders of Preferred Stock.

7. No Reissuance of Preferred Stock. No share or shares of Preferred Stock acquired
by the Corporation by reason of redemption, purchase, conversion or otherwise shall be reissued,
and all such shares shall be cancelled, retired and eliminated from the shares which the
