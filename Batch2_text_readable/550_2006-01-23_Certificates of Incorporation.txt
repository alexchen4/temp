iegally available therefor, dividends at the rate of $0.038 per annum per share (as adjusted for any
stock dividends, stock splits, recapitalizations, combinations, consolidations or the like), on each
outstanding share of Series B Preferred Stock. After the payiient of such dividends to the holders of

material changes provided for herein; provided, however, that such periods may be shortened upon
the written consent of the holders of Preferred Stock that are entitled to such notice rights or similar
notice rights and that represent at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares
of such Preferred Stock.

3. Redemption.

(a) At any time after January 31, 2009, upon the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock then outstanding, this corporation
shall redeem, from any source of funds legally available therefor, the Series B Preferred Stock. Such
redemption shall be effected in three annual payments beginning not later than sixty (60) days after
the date on which the Corporation receives notice of the vote of the holders of the Series B Preferred
Stock. The first redemption payment shall be paid within ten (10) days following the expiration of
the sixty-day notice period; each of the subsequent two redemption payments shall be paid to the
holders of the Series B Preferred Stock on or before the second and third anniversary dates,
respectively, of the first redemption payment (each a “Series B Redemption Date”). The
Corporation shall effect such redemption payments on the applicable Series B Redemption Dates by
paying in cash in exchange for the shares of Series B Preferred Stock to be redeemed a sum equal to
the Original Series B Issue Price per share of Series B Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any stock
dividends, combinations or splits with respect to such shares) plus all declared or accumulated but
unpaid dividends on such shares (the “Series B Redemption Price’). The number of shares of Series
B Preferred Stock that the Corporation shall be required under this Section B.3(a) to redeem on any
one Series B Redemption Date shall be equal to the amount determined by dividing (i) the aggregate
number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Series B
Redemption Date by (ii) the number of remaining Series B Redemption Dates (including the Series
B Redemption Date to which such calculation applies). If the funds of the Corporation legally
available for redemption of shares of Series B Preferred Stock on any Series B Redemption Date are
insufficient to redeem the total number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such
date, those funds which are legally available will be used to redeem the maximum possible number
of such shares ratably among the holders of such shares to be redeemed based upon their holdings of
Series B Preferred Stock (so that each holder of Series B Preferred Stock shall receive a redemption
payment equal to a fraction of the aggregate amount available for redemption, the numerator of
which is the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock held by such holder multiplied by the
Series B Redemption Price, and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of shares of

4.
3245280_7.DOC
Series B Preferred Stock outstanding multiplied by the Series B Redemption Price). The shares of
Scries B Preferred Stock not redeemed shall remain outstanding and entitled to all the rights and
preferences provided herein, At any time thereafter when additional funds of the Corporation are
legally available for the redemption of shares of Serics B Preferred Stock such funds will
immediately be used to redeem the balance of the shares that the Corporation has become obliged to
redeem on any Series B Redemption Date but that it has not redeemed. Any redemption effected
pursuant to this Section 3(a) shall be made on a pro rata basis among the holders of the Series B
Preferred Stock in proportion to the Series B Preferred Stock then held by them.

(b) At any time after January 31, 2009, upon the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding (the “Series A
Redemption Request”), this corporation shall redeem, from any source of funds legally available
therefor, the Series A Preferred Stock; provided, however, that if on the date of the Series A
Redemption Request, there are any outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock, then such right of
redemption may not be exercised, Subject to the immediately preceding sentence, the redemption
provided under this Section B.3(b) shall be effected in three annual payments beginning not later
than sixty (60) days after the date on which the Con, *ration receives notice of the vote of the holders
of the Series A Preferred Stock. The first redempticn payment shall be paid within ten (10) days
following the expiration of the sixty-day notice period; each of the subsequent two redemption
payments shall be paid to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock on or before the second and
third anniversary dates, respectively, of the first redemption payment (each a “Series A Redemption
Date” and with the Series B Redemption Date, the “Redemption Dates”). The Corporation shall
effect such redemption payments on the applicable Series A Redemption Dates by paying in cash in
exchange for the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed a sum equal to the Original
Series A Issue Price per share of Series A Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any stock dividends,
combinations or splits with respect to such shares) plus all declared or accumulated but unpaid
dividends on such shares (the “Series A Redemption Price” and with the Series B Redemption Price,
the “Redemption Price”). The number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock that the Corporation
shall be required under this Section B.3(b) to redeem on any one Series A Redemption Date shail be
equal to the amount determined by dividing (i) the aggregate number of shares of Series A Preferred
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Series A Redemption Date by (ii) the number of
remaining Series A Redemption Dates (including the Series A Redemption Date to which such
calculation applies). If the funds of the Corporation legally available for redemption of shares of
Series A Preferred Stock on any Series A Redemption Date are insufficient to redeem the total
number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such date, those funds which are
legally available will be used to redeem the maximum possible number of such shares ratably among
the holders of such shares to be redeemed based upon their holdings of Series A Preferred Stock (so
that each holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall receive a redemption payment equal to a fraction
of the aggregate amount available for redemption, the numerator of which is tie number of shares of
Series A Preferred Stock held by such holder multiplied by the Series A Redemption Price, and the
denominator of which is the aggregate number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding
multiplied by the Series A Redemption Price). The shares of Series A Preferred Stock not redeemed
shall remain outstanding and entitled to all the rights and preferences provided herein. At any time
thereafter when additional funds of the Corporation are legally available for the redemption of shares
of Series A Preferred Stock such funds will immediately be used to redeem the balance of the shares
that the Corporation has become obliged to redeem on any Series A Redemption Late but that it has

-5-
3245280_7.D0C
not redeemed. Any redemption effected pursuant to this Section 3(b) shall be made on a pro rata
basis among the holders of the Serics A Preferred Stock in proportion to the Series A Preferred
Stock then held by them.

(c) At least fifteen (15) but no more than thirty (30) days prior to each
applicable Redemption Date written notice shall be mailed, first class postage prepaid, to each holder
of record (at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is
given) of the Preferred Stock to be redeemed, at the address last shown on the records of the
corporation for such holder, notifying such holder of the redemption to be effected, specifying the
number of shares to be redee.ned from such holder, the applicable Redemption Date, the applicable
Redemption Price, the place at which payment may be obtained and calling upon such holder to
surrender to the Corporation, in the manner and at the place designa.-d, his certificate or certificates
representing the shares tc be redeemed (the “Redemption Notice”). Except as provided in
Section B.3(d), on or after the Redemption Date, each holder of Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall
surrender to this corporation the certificate or certificates representing such shares, in the manner
and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice, and thereupon the applicable Redemption
Price of such shares shall be payable to the order of the person wliose name appears on such
certificate or certificates as the owner thereof and each surrendered certificate shall be cancelled. In
the event less than all the shares represented by any such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate
shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares.

(d) From and after the applicable Redemption Date, unless there shall
have been a default in payment of the applicable Redemption Price, all rights of the holders of shares
of Preferred Stock designated for redemption in the Redemption Notice as holders of Preferred Stock
(except the right to receive the applicable Redemption Price without interest upon surrender of their
certificate or certificates) shall cease with respect to such shares, and such shares shall not thereafter
be transferred on the books of the Corporation or be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose
whatsoever.

respective holders of the shares designated for redemption and not yet redeemed, with irrevocable
instructions and authority to the bank or trust corporation to pay the applicable Redemption Price for
such shares to their respective holders on or after the Redemption Date upon receipt of notification
from the corporation that such holder has surrendered his share certificate to the corporation
pursuant to Section B.3(c). As of the date of such deposit (even if prior to the Redemption Date), the
deposit shall constitute full payment of the shares to their holders, and from and after the date of the
deposit the shares so called for redemption shall be redeemed and shall bc deemed to be no longer
outstanding, and the holders thereof shall cease to be shareholders with respect to such shares and
shall have no rights with respect thereto except the rights to receive from the bank or trust
corporation payment of the applicable Redemption Price of the shares, without interest, upon
surrende- of tneir certificates therefor, and the right to convert such shares as provided in
Section B 4. Such instructions shali also provide that any monies deposited by the corporation
