resulting in ownership of more than 50% of the equity of the acquiring corporation by
shareholders of the Company) or (ii) a sale of the voting control of the Company or (iii) a sale

securities or property other than cash, the value of such distribution shall be the fair market
value of such securities or other property as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

4.3.3.6 In the event of a Deemed Liquidation Event, if any portion of the consideration payable
to the stockholders of the Company is payable only upon satisfaction of contingencies (the
“Additional Consideration”), the definitive agreement with respect to such Deemed
Liquidation Event shall provide that (i) the portion of such consideration that is not Additional
Consideration (such portion, the “Initial Consideration”) shal] be allocated among the holders
of capital stock of the Company in accordance with Sections 4.3.3, 4.4.3, 4.5.3, 4.6.3 and 4.7.3
as if the Initial Consideration were the only consideration payable in connection with such

stockholders of the Company upon satisfaction of such contingencies shall be allocated among
the holders of capital stock of the Company in accordance with Sections 4.3.3, 4.4.3, 4.5.3,

part of the same transaction. For the purposes of this Section 4.3.3.6, consideration placed into
escrow or retained as a holdback to be available for satisfaction of indemnification or similar
obligations in connection with such Deemed Liquidation Event shall be deemed to be

Conversion.
4.3.4.1 Terms of Conversion.

4.3.4.1.1 Optional Conversion. The holder of each share of Series A Preferred
shall have the right {the "Series A Conversion Right"), at such holder's option, to
convert such share at any time, without cost and otherwise on the terms of this
Section 4.3.4, into the number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common
that results from dividing:

(A) $1.00,
by:

(B) the Series A Conversion Price (as defined below) in effect at the time of
conversion.

The "Series A Conversion Price" as of the date of the filing of this Restated
Certificate (the “Filing Date”) shall be $22.6272 and shall be subject to
adjustment from time to time as provided in this Section 4.3.4.

4.3.4.1.2 Mandatory Conversion. All of the outstanding Series A Preferred
shall, without any further action by a holder thereof, convert into Common (a
"Series A Mandatory Conversion") upon the first to occur of the following (each
a "Series A Mandatory Conversion Event"): (A) the Company's Qualified Public
Offering (as defined below), (B) at such time as at least two-thirds of the aggregate
H# 379497

-6-

number of shares of Series A Preferred issued prior to such time have been
voluntarily converted into Common by the holders thereof, (C) at such time as is
specified in a vote or written consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Series A Preferred, or (D) at such time as is specified in a vote or written
consent of the holders of at least the Series E Approval Amount with respect to the
conversion of all Preferred into Common. In each case each share of Series A
Preferred shall be automatically converted, without cost, on the terms of this
Section 4.3.4, into the number of shares of Common into which such share of
Series A Preferred would be convertible under Section 4.3.4.1.1 immediately prior
to such conversion. As used in this Restated Certificate, "Qualified Public
Offering" means the closing of a firm commitment underwritten public offering
pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933,
covering the offer and sale of Common for the account of the Company to the
public at a price per share of not less than three times the Series E Original
Purchase Price (as defined below) (as adjusted for stock splits, dividends and the
like) with aggregate proceeds to the Company of not less than $50,000,000 (before
deduction of underwriters commissions and expenses).

4.3.4.2 Mechanics of Conversion.

4.3.4.2.1 Optional Conversion. A holder of any share of Series A Preferred may
exercise the Series A Conversion Right of such share by surrendering the certificate
therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Company or of any transfer agent for
the Series A Preferred, together with a written notice to the Company which states:

(A) that such holder elects to convert the same,
(B) the number of shares of Series A Preferred being converted, and

(C) the name or names in which such holder wishes the certificate or
certificates for shares of Common to be issued.

Thereupon the Company shall promptly issue and deliver to the holder of such
shares, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates
for the number of shares of Common to which such holder shall be entitled. If
the certificate evidencing the shares of Series A Preferred being converted shall
also evidence shares of Series A Preferred not being converted, then the
Company shall also deliver to the holder of such certificate, or to the nominee or
nominees of such holder, a new stock certificate evidencing the Series A
Preferred not converted. Any dividends or distributions declared but unpaid at
the time of conversion with respect to a share of Series A Preferred so converted
shall be payable ratably to the holders of the Common issued upon such
conversion,

4.3.4.2.2 | Mandatory Conversion. The Company shall give written notice to
each holder of a share of Series A Preferred (A) not more than forty (40) nor less
than twenty (20) days before the anticipated effective date of the registration
statement with respect to any Qualified Public Offering, and shall also give written
notice to each such holder upon the occurrence of any Qualified Public Offering;
and (B) upon the occurrence of any other Series A Mandatory Conversion Event.

H# 379497

-7-

Following the conversion of such shares, each holder of shares so converted may
surrender the certificate therefor at the office of the Company or any transfer agent
for the Series A Preferred. Upon such surrender, the Company shall issue and
deliver to each holder, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate
or certificates for the number of shares of Common to which such holder is
entitled. Any dividends or distributions declared but unpaid at the time of
conversion with respect to a share of Series A Preferred so converted shall be
payable ratably to the holders of the Common issued upon such conversion.

43.4.3 Effective Date of Conversion.

4.3.4.3.1 Optional Conversion. The conversion of any shares of Series A
Preferred shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of
business on the date that the shares to be converted are surrendered to the Company
together with the notice required by Section 4.3.4.2.1, and the person or persons
entitled to receive the shares of Common issuable upon such conversion shall be
treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common
on such date.

4.3.4.3.2 Mandatory Conversion. The conversion of shares of Series A
Preferred shall take place upon the first to occur of the Series A Mandatory
Conversion Events, whether or not the certificates representing such shares of
Series A Preferred shall have been surrendered, or new certificates representing the
shares of Common into which such shares have been converted shall have been
issued.

4.3.4.4 Adjustment of Conversion Price.

4.3.4.4.1 Subdivision or Combination of Shares. If the Company at any time
subdivides or combines the outstanding Common after the Filing Date, the Series A
Conversion Price shall be decreased, in the case of a subdivision, or increased, in
the case of a combination, in the same proportions as the Common is subdivided or
combined, effective automatically as of the date the Company shall take a record of
the holders of its Common for the purpose of the subdivision or combination (or if
no such record is taken, as of the effectiveness of the subdivision or combination).

4.3.4.4.2 Stock Dividends. If the Company at any time pays a dividend, or
makes any other distribution, to holders of Common payable in shares of Common,
or fixes a record date for the determination of holders of Common entitled to
receive a dividend or other distribution payable in shares of Common, the Series A
Conversion Price shall be decreased by multiplying it by a fraction:

(A) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common
outstanding immediately prior to such dividend or distribution, and

(B) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common
outstanding immediately after such dividend or distribution (plus, if the
Company paid cash instead of fractional shares otherwise issuable in such
dividend or distribution, the number of additional shares which would have been
outstanding had the Company issued fractional shares instead of cash),
H# 379497

-8-

effective automatically as of the date the Company shall take a record of the
holders of its Common for the purpose of receiving such dividend or distribution
(or if no such record is taken, as of the effectiveness of such dividend or
distribution).

43.443 Reclassification, Consolidation or Merger. If at any time, as a result
of:

(A) a capital reorganization or reclassification (other than a subdivision,
combination or dividend which gives rise to adjustment of the Series A
Conversion Price pursuant to Sections 4.3.4.4.1 or 4.3.4.4.2), or

(B) a merger or consolidation of the Company with another corporation
(whether or not the Company is the surviving corporation), excluding a Deemed
Liquidation Event,

the Common issuable upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred shall be
changed into or exchanged for the same or a different number of shares of any
class or classes of stock of the Company or any other corporation, or other
securities convertible into such shares, ‘hen, as a part of such reorganization,
reclassification, merger or consolidation, appropriate adjustments shall be made
in the terms of the Series A Preferred (or of any securities into which the Series
A Preferred is changed or for which the Series A Preferred is exchanged), so that:

(X) the hoiders of Series A Preferred or of such substitute securities shall
thereafter be entitled to receive, upon conversion of the Series A Preferred or of
such substitute securities, the kind and amount of shares of stock, other
securities, money and property which such holders would have received at the
time of such capital reorganization, reclassification, merger, or consolidation, if
such holders had converted their Series A Preferred into Common immediately
prior to such capital reorganization, reclassification, merger, or consolidation,
and

{Y) the Series A Preferred or such substitute securities shall thereafter be
adjusted on terms as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments
theretofore provided in this Section 4.3.4.4.

The provisions of this Section 4.3.4.4.3 shall similarly apply to successive capital
reorganizations, reclassifications, mergers, and consolidations.

adjustments under Sections 4.3.4.4.1, 4.3.4.4.2, 4.3.4.4.3, 4.4.4.4.1,
4# 379497

(B)

4.4.44.2, 44443, 4544.1, 4.5.4.4.2, 4.5.4.4.3, 4.6.4.4.1, 4.6.4.4.2,
4.6.4.4.3, 4.7.4.4.1, 4.7.4.4.2 or 4.7.4.4.3,

(2) shares of Common issued upon conversion of shares of Series A
Preferred, Series B Preferred, Series C Preferred, Series D Preferred or
Series E Preferred,

(3) shares of Common issued upon the exercise of any options

(5) shares of Common issued upon the exercise of warrants (i)
described in the Disclosure Schedule to the Series E Purchase Agreement
or (ii) issued pursuant to the Series E Purchase Agreement, and shares of

(6) securities issuable to The Rockefeller University, Baylor

approval of at least three Investor Members (as such term is defined in
the Sixth Amended and Restated Stockholders’ Agreement by and
among the Company and the other parties thereto dated on or about the
Filing Date, as it may be amended, restated or otherwise modified from
time to time (the “Stockholders’ Agreement”)), or

(7) shares of Series D Preferred issued pursuant to that certain
Amendment and Exchange Agreement, dated on or about the Filing
Date, by and among the Company and the stockholders of the Company
named therein.

If at any time the Company issues (or is deemed by the express

provisions of Section 4.3.4.4.5 to have issued or sold) Additional Shares of
Common without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the
lower of (4) the Series A Conversion Price in effect at such issuance or (ii) the
Series E Conversion Price (as defined below) in effect at such issuance, then the
Series A Conversion Price shal] be reduced, concurrently with such issuance, to a
price (calculated to the nearest cent) equal to the price determined by multiplying
the Series A Conversion Price by a fraction:

(1) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of such
H# 379497

-10-

Additional Shares of Common plus the number of shares of Common
which the aggregate consideration received (or by the express provisions
hereof deemed to have been received) by the Company for the total
number of such Additional Shares of Common so issued would purchase
at the Series A Conversion Price, and

(2) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Outstanding immediately after the issuance of such Additional
Shares of Common;

provided, however, that in no event shall the Series A Conversion Price be
reduced below $0.01.

(C) The term "Common Outstanding" shall include all Common issued and
outstanding and issuable upon exercise or conversion of all outstanding
Convertible Securities. In the case of Convertible Securities which are, by their
terms, convertible into securities that have not yet been authorized or designated
or which are convertible into, or exercisable for, securities at a conversion rate or
exercise price (or into or for a corresponding number of shares of Common)
which may not be determined at the time of the determination under Section
4,3.4.4.4(B), such Convertible Securities shall be deemed to be converted or
exercised based upon a rate or price (and for a number of shares of Common)
reflecting: (i) if such Convertible Securities have a provision which contains a
price or rate which is fixed or can be fixed as of the date of the determination
under Section 4.3.4.4.4(B), then such price or rate or (Ji) otherwise, at the price of
securities issued in the Company’s most recent equity financing.

means all rights or options for the purchase of, or stock or other securities

respect to Series A Preferred, Section 4.4.4.4.4 with respect to Series B Preferred,
Section 4.5.4.4.4 with respect to Series C Preferred, Section 4.6.4.4.4 with
respect to Series D Preferred or Section 4.7.4.4.4 with respect to Series E
Preferred, if at any time or from time to time after the first date of issuance of any
Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred, Series C Preferred, Series D Preferred or
Series E Preferred, as applicable, the Company issues or sells Convertible
Securities (other than options or rights exercisable for or convertible into shares
of Common referred to in clauses (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7) of the definition of
Additional Shares of Common Stock), then in each case the Company shall be
deemed to have issued at the time of the issuance of such Convertible Securities
the maximum number of Additional Shares of Common Stock (as set forth in the
instruments relating thereto, giving effect to any provision contained therein for a
subsequent upward adjustment of such number) issuable upon exercise or
conversion thereof and to have received as consideration therefor an amount
cqual to the total amount of the consideration, if any, received by the Company

for the issuance of such Convertible Securities plus the minimum amounts of
consideration, if any (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, giving effect
to any provision contained therein for a subsequent downward adjustment of
such consideration), payable to the Company upon the exercise or conversion of
such Convertible Securities and the minimum amounts of consideration, if any,
payable to the Company (other than by cancellation of Jiabilities or obligations
evidenced by such Convertible Securities which were deemed to have been
received by the Company on issuance of such Convertible Securities) upon the
exercise of any Convertible Securities issuable upon the exercise or conversion
of such Convertible Securities. No further adjustment of the Conversion Price
for Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred, Series C Preferred, Series D Preferred
or Series E Preferred, as applicable, adjusted upon the issuance of such
Convertible Securities, shall be made as a result of the actual issuance of
Additional Shares of Common Stock on the exercise or the conversion of any
such Convertible Securities; provided, however, that if the Convertible Securities
or the conversion privilege represented by any such Convertible Securities shail
expire without having been exercised, or are exercised for a lesser number of
Additional Shares of Common Stock or with a greater consideration paid to the
Company than was previously deemed to be issued or received by the Company,
the Conversion Price for Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred, Series C
Preferred, Series D Preferred or Series E Preferred, as applicable, adjusted upon
the issuance of such Convertible Securities shall be readjusted to the Conversion
Price for Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred, Series C Preferred, Series D
Preferred or Series E Preferred, as applicable, which would have been in effect
had an adjustment been made on the basis that the only Additional Shares of
Common Stock so issued were the Additional Shares of Common Stock, if any,
actually issued or sold on the exercise or conversion of such Convertible
Securities, and such Additional Shares of Common Stock, if any, were issued or
sold for the consideration actually received by the Company upon such exercise,
plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the Company for the granting
of all such Convertible Securities constituting warrants or options, whether or not
exercised, plus the consideration received for issuing or selling the Convertible
Securities actually converted plus the consideration, if any, actually received by
the Company (other than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by
such Convertible Securities which were deemed to have been received by the
Company on issuance of such Convertible Securities) on the conversion of such
Convertible Securities.

could then be converted (assuming, for the purposes of calculating the amount of dividends to
be paid under this section, in the case of dividends declared on shares of Series A Preferred,
that such shares of Series A Preferred had been converted into shares of Common and such
dividends had been declared on the shares of Common issued upon conversion thereof).

4.4.4,.1.1 Optional Conversion. The holder of each share of Series B Preferred
shall have the right (the "Series B Conversion Right"), at such holder's option, to
convert such share at any time, without cost and otherwise on the terms of this
Section 4.4.4, into the number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common
that results from dividing:

{A) $1.76,
by:

(B) the Series B Conversion Price (as defined herein) in effect at the time of

4.4.4.1.2 | Mandatory Conversion. All of the outstanding Series B Preferred

Offering, (B) at such time as at least two-thirds of the aggregate number of shares
of Series B Preferred issued prior to such time have been voluntarily converted into
Common by the holders thereof, (C) at such time as is specified in a vote or written
consent of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Series B
Preferred, or (D) at such time as is specified in a vote or written consent of the
holders of at least the Series E Approval Amount with respect to the conversion of
all Preferred into Common. In each case each share of Series B Preferred shall be
automatically converted, without cost, on the terms of this Section 4.4.4, into the

convertible under Section 4.4.4.1.] immediately prior to such conversion.

4.4.4.2 Mechanics of Conversion.

4.4.4.2.1 Optional Conversion. A holder of any share of Series B Preferred may

certificates for shares of Common to be issued.

Thereupon the Company shall promptly issue and deliver to the holder of such
shares, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates
for the number of shares of Common to which such holder shall be entitled. If
the certificate evidencing the shares of Series B Preferred being converted shall
also evidence shares of Series B Preferred not being converted, then the
Company shall also deliver to the holder of such certificate, or to the nominee or
nominees of such holder, a new stock certificate evidencing the Series B
Preferred not converted. Any dividends or distributions declared but unpaid at
the time of conversion with respect to a share of Series B Preferred so converted
shall be payable ratably to the holders of the Common issued upon such
conversion.

4.4.4.2.2 | Mandatory Conversion. The Company shall give written notice to
each holder of a share of Series B Preferred (A) not more than forty (40) nor less
than twenty (20) days before the anticipated effective date of the registration

notice to each such holder upon the occurrence of any Qualified Public Offering;
and (B) upon the occurrence of any other Series B Mandatory Conversion Event.
Following the conversion of such shares, each holder of shares so converted may
surrender the certificate therefor at the office of the Company or any transfer agent
for the Series B Preferred. Upon such surrender, the Company shall issue and
deliver to each holder, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate
or certificates for the number of shares of Common to which such holder is
entitled. Any dividends or distributions declared but unpaid at the time of
conversion with respect to a share of Series B Preferred so converted shall be
payable ratably to the holders of the Common issued upon such conversion.

Preferred shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of
business on the date that the shares to be converted are surrendered to the Company

entitled to receive the shares of Common issuable upon such conversion shall be
treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common
on such date.

4.4.4.3.2 Mandatory Conversion. The conversion of shares of Series B
Preferred shall take place upon the first to occur of the Series B Mandatory
Conversion Events, whether or not the certificates representing such shares of
Series B Preferred shall have been surrendered, or new certificates representing the
shares of Common into which such shares have been converted shall have been
issued,

4.4.4.4 Adjustment of Conversion Price.
H# 379497

4.44.4.1 Subdivision or Combination of Shares. If the Company at any time
subdivides or combines the outstanding Common after the Filing Date, the Series B
Conversion Price shall be decreased, in the case of a subdivision, or increased, in
the case of a combination, in the same proportions as the Common is subdivided or
combined, effective automatically as of the date the Company shall take a record of
the holders of its Common for the purpose of the subdivision or combination (or if
no such record is taken, as of the effectiveness of the subdivision or combination).

4444.2 Stock Dividends. If the Company at any time pays a dividend, or
makes any other distribution, to holders of Common payable in shares of Common,
or fixes a record date for the determination of holders of Common entitled to
receive a dividend or other distribution payable in shares of Common, the Series B
Conversion Price shall be decreased by multiplying it by a fraction:

(A) _ the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common
outstanding immediately prior to such dividend or distribution, and

(B) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common
outstanding immediately after such dividend or distribution (plus, if the
Company paid cash instead of fractional shares otherwise issuable in such
dividend or distribution, the number of additional shares which would have been
outstanding had the Company issued fractional shares instead of cash),

effective automatically as of the date the Company shall take a record of the
holders of its Common for the purpose of receiving such dividend or distribution
(or if no such record is taken, as of the effectiveness of such dividend or
distribution).

4444.3 Reclassification, Consolidation or Merger. If at any time, as a result
of:

(A) a capital reorganization or reclassification (other than a subdivision,
combination or dividend which gives rise to adjustment of the Series B
Conversion Price pursuant to Sections 4.4.4.4.1 or 4.4.4.4.2), or

(B) a merger or consolidation of the Company with another corporation
(whether or not the Company is the surviving corporation),

the Common issuable upon the conversion of the Series B Preferred shall be
changed into or exchanged for the same or a different number of shares of any
class or classes of stock of the Company or any other corporation, or other
securities convertible into such shares, then, as a part of such reorganization,
reclassification, merger or consolidation, appropriate adjustments shall be made
in the terms of the Series B Preferred (or of any securities into which the Series B
Preferred is changed or for which the Series B Preferred is exchanged), so that:

(X) the holders of Series B Preferred or of such substitute securities shall
thereafter be entitled to receive, upon conversion of the Series B Preferred or of
such substitute securities, the kind and amount of shares of stock, other
securities, money and property which such holders would have received at the
H# 379497

~20 -

lime of such capital reorganization, reclassification, merger, or consolidation, if
such holders had converted their Series B Preferred into Common immediately
prior to such capital reorganization, reclassification, merger, or consolidation,
and

(Y) the Series B Preferred or such substitute securities shall thereafter be
adjusted on terms as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments
theretofore provided in this Section 4.4.4.4.

The provisions of this Section 4.4.4.4.3 shall similarly apply to successive capita]
reorganizations, reclassifications, mergers, and consolidations.

444.44 Additional Shares of Common. If at any time the Company issues (or
is deemed by the express provisions of Section 4.3.4.4.5 to have issued or sold)
Additional Shares of Common without consideration or for a consideration per
share less than the lower of (i) the Series B Conversion Price in effect at such
issuance or (ii) the Series E Conversion Price in effect at such issuance, then the
Series B Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issuance, to a
price (calculated to the nearest cent) equal to the price determined by multiplying
the Series B Conversion Price by a fraction:

(A) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common
Outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Shares of
Common plus the number of shares of Common which the aggregate
consideration received (or by the express provisions hereof deemed to have been
received) by the Company for the total number of such Additional Shares of
Common so issued would purchase at the Series B Conversion Price, and

(B) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common
Outstanding immediately after the issuance of such Additional Shares of
Common;

provided, however, that in no event shall the Series B Conversion Price be
reduced below $0.01.

4444.5 Convertible Securities. For purposes of the adjustment required under
Section 4.4.4.4.4, Convertible Securities shall be treated as described in Section
4.3.4.4.5,

44446 Valuation of Consideration. The value of consideration received by
the Company for any issue or sale of securities shall be determined as set forth in
Section 4.3.4.4.6.

Series E Preferred pursuant to the provisions of Section 4.7.4.4.7, holders of Series
D Preferred pursuant to the provisions of Section 4.6.4.4.7 and holders of Series C
Preferred pursuant to the provisions of Section 4.5.4.4.7, if the Company, at any
time while any of the Series B Preferred is outstanding, shall make a distribution of
its assets to the holders of its Common as a dividend in liquidation or partial
liquidation or by way of return of capital or other than as a dividend payable out of

4.4.5

l# 379497

a

funds legally available for dividends under the laws of the State of Delaware, the
holders of the Series B Preferred shall be entitled to receive, without payment of
any consideration therefor, the assets that would have been payable to them as
owners of that number of shares of Common receivable by exercise of such Series
B Conversion Rights, had they been the holders of record of such Common on the
record date for such distribution; and an appropriate provision therefor shall be

Company shall also deliver to the holder of such certificate, or to the nominee or
nominees of such holder, a new stock certificate evidencing the Series C
Preferred not converted. Any dividends or distributions declared but unpaid at
the time of conversion with respect to a share of Series C Preferred so converted

for the Series C Preferred. Upon such surrender, the Company shall issue and
deliver to each holder, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate
or certificates for the number of shares of Common to which such holder is
entitled. Any dividends or distributions declared but unpaid at the time of
conversion with respect to a share of Series C Preferred so converted shall be
payable ratably to the holders of the Common issued upon such conversion.

4.5.4.3 Effective Date of Conversion.

4.5.4.3.1 Optional Conversion. The conversion of any shares of Series C
Preferred shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of

Preferred shall take place upon the first to occur of the Series C Mandatory
Conversion Events, whether or not the certificates representing such shares of

issued.

4.5.4.4 Adjustment of Conversion Price.

4.5.44.1 Subdivision or Combination of Shares. If the Company at any time
subdivides or combines the outstanding Common after the Filing Date, the Series C

combined, effective automatically as of the date the Company shall take a record of
the holders of its Common for the purpose of the subdivision or combination (or if
no such record is taken, as of the effectiveness of the subdivision or combination).

4.5.4.4.2 Stock Dividends. If the Company at any time pays a dividend, or
makes any other distribution, to holders of Common payable in shares of Common,
or fixes a record date for the determination of holders of Common entitled to
receive a dividend or other distribution payable in shares of Common, the Series C
Conversion Price shall be decreased by multiplying it by a fraction:

(A) _ the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common
outstanding immediately prior to such dividend or distribution, and
Li 379497

- 28 -

(B) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common
outstanding immediately after such dividend or distribution (plus, if the
Company paid cash instead of fractional shares otherwise issuable in such
dividend or distribution, the number of additional shares which would have been
outstanding had the Company issued fractional shares instead of cash),

distribution).

(B) a merger or consolidation of the Company with another corporation
(whether or not the Company is the surviving corporation),

the Common issuable upon the conversion of the Series C Preferred shall be
changed into or exchanged for the same or a different number of shares of any
class or classes of stock of the Company or any other corporation, or other
securities convertible into such shares, then, as a part of such reorganization,
reclassification, merger or consolidation, appropriate adjustments shall be made
in the terms of the Series C Preferred (or of any securities into which the Series C
Preferred is changed or for which the Series C Preferred is exchanged), so that:

(X) the holders of Series C Preferred or of such substitute securities shall
thereafter be entitled to receive, upon conversion of the Series C Preferred or of
such substitute securities, the kind and amount of shares of stock, other
securities, money and property which such holders would have received at the
time of such capital reorganization, reclassification, merger, or consolidation, if
such holders had converted their Series C Preferred into Common immediately
prior to such capital reorganization, reclassification, merger, or consolidation,
and

(Y) the Series C Preferred or such substitute securities shall thereafter be
adjusted on terms as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments

share less than the lower of (i) the Series C Conversion Price in effect at such
issuance or (ii) the Series E Conversion Price in effect at such issuance, then the

H# 379497

-29-

Series C Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issuance, to a
price (calculated to the nearest cent) equal to the price determined by multiplying
the Series C Conversion Price by a fraction:

(A) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common
Outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Shares of
Common plus the number of shares of Common which the aggregate
consideration received (or by the express provisions hereof deemed to have been
received) by the Company for the total number of such Additional Shares of
Common so issued would purchase at the Series C Conversion Price, and

(B) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common
Outstanding immediately after the issuance of such Additional Shares of
Common;

provided, however, that in no event shall the Series C Conversion Price be
reduced below $0.0).

4.5.44.5 Convertible Securities. For purposes of the adjustment required under

distribution of its assets to the holders of its Common as a dividend in liquidation
or partial liquidation or by way of return of capital or other than as a dividend
payable out of funds legally available for dividends under the laws of the State of

them as owners of that number of shares of Common receivable by exercise of such
Series C Conversion Rights, had they been the holders of record of such Common
on the record date for such distribution; and an appropriate provision therefor shall

provisions of Section 4.5.3 of this Restated Certificate.

name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof, and each surrendered
certificate shall be cancelled and retired. If a certificate is surrendered and all the shares
evidenced thereby cannot be redeemed, the Company shall cause certificates evidencing the
shares not being redeemed to be issued in the name of the registered owner of such shares and
to be delivered to such person.

4.5.5.5 If the Series C Redemption Price is either paid or made available for payment through
the deposit arrangement specified in Section 4.5.5.6 with respect to any shares of Series C
Preferred, then notwithstanding that the certificates evidencing any of the shares to be
redeemed shall not have been surrendered, all rights with respect to such shares shall terminate
as of the Series C Redemption Date, except only the right of the holder to receive the Series C

Series C Redemption Price of all outstanding shares of Series C Preferred with irrevocable
instructions and authority to the bank or trust company to pay, on or after the Series C
Redemption Date, the Series C Redemption Price to the respective holders of Series C
Preferred upon the surrender of their share certificates. From and after the date of such deposit,
the shares so called for redemption shall be redeemed. The deposit shall constitute full
payment of the shares to their holders, and from and after the Series C Redemption Date, the
shares shall be deemed to be no longer outstanding, and the holders thereof shall cease to be
shareholders with respect thereto and shall have no rights with respect thereto except the rights
to receive from the bank or trust company payment of the Series C Redemption Price of the
shares, without interest, upon surrender of their certificates therefor (and a certificate for those
shares, if any, evidenced by such certificates which are not being redeemed on such Series C
Redemption Date). Any funds so deposited and unclaimed at the end of one year from such
Series C Redemption Date shall be released or repaid to the Company, after which the former
holders of the shares called for redemption shall be entitled to receive payment of the Series C
Redemption Price with respect to such shares only from the Company.

Series C Redemption Election in accordance with Section 4.5.5.6. The maximum number of
full shares of Series C Preferred that can be redeemed with such funds shall be redeemed from
the holders of shares of Series C Preferred as of the date of such Series C Redemption Election
ratably in accordance with the full amounts otherwise payable to them. Thereafter, the
Company shall redeem shares of Series C Preferred ratably from the holders thereof as funds
legally available therefor become available.

Conversion.

4.6.4.1 Terms of Conversion.

4.6.4.1.1 Optional Conversion. The holder of each share of Series D Preferred
shall have the right (the "Series D Conversion Right"), at such holder's option, to
convert such share at any time, without cost and otherwise on the terms of this
Section 4.6.4, into the number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common
that results from dividing:

(A) the Series D Original Purchase Price,

by:

(B) the Series D Conversion Price (as defined below) in effect at the time of
conversion.

The "Series D Conversion Price" as of the Filing Date shall be $1.978565 and
shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in this Section 4.6.4.

4.6.4.1.2 Mandatory Conversion. All of the outstanding Series D Preferred
shall, without any further action by a holder thereof, convert into Common (a
"Series D Mandatory Conversion") upon the first to occur of the following (each
a “Series D Mandatory Conversion Event”): (A) the Company's Qualified Public
Offering, (B) at such time as at least 60% of the aggregate number of shares of
Series D Preferred issued prior to such time have been voluntarily converted into
Common by the holders thereof, (C) at such time as is specified in a vote or written
consent of the holders of at least 60% of the outstanding shares of Series D
Preferred, or (D) at such time as is specified in a vote or written consent of the
holders of at least the Series E Approval Amount with respect to the conversion of
all Preferred into Common. In each case, each share of Series D Preferred shall be
automatically converted, without cost, on the terms of this Section 4.7.4, into the
number of shares of Common into which such share of Series D Preferred would
be convertible under 4.6.4.1.] immediately prior to such conversion.

4.6.4.2 Mechanics of Conversion.

4.6.4.2.1 | Qptional Conversion. A holder of any share of Series D Preferred may
exercise the Series D Conversion Right of such share by surrendering the certificate

H# 379497

-35-

therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Company or of any transfer agent for
the Series D Preferred, together with a written notice to the Company which states:

(A) that such holder elects to convert the same,
(B) the number of shares of Series D Preferred being converted, and

(C) the name or names in which such holder wishes the certificate or
certificates for shares of Common to be issued.

Thereupon the Company shall promptly issue and deliver to the holder of such
shares, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates
for the number of shares of Common to which such holder shall be entitled. If
the certificate evidencing the shares of Series D Preferred being converted shall
also evidence shares of Series D Preferred not being converted, then the
Company shall also deliver to the holder of such certificate, or to the nominee or
nominees of such holder, a new stock certificate evidencing the Series D
Preferred not converted. Any dividends or distributions declared but unpaid at
the time of conversion with respect to a share of Series D Preferred so converted
shall be payable ratably to the holders of the Common issued upon such
conversion.

4.6.4.2.2 | Mandatory Conversion. The Company shall give written notice to
each holder of a share of Series D Preferred (A) not more than forty (40) nor less
than twenty (20) days before the anticipated effective date of the registration
statement with respect to any Qualified Public Offering, and shall also give written
notice to each such holder upon the occurrence of any Qualified Public Offering;
and (B) upon the occurrence of any other Series D Mandatory Conversion Event.
Following the conversion of such shares, each holder of shares so converted may
surrender the certificate therefor at the office of the Company or any transfer agent
for the Series D Preferred. Upon such surrender, the Company shall issue and
deliver to each holder, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate
or certificates for the number of shares of Common to which such holder is
entitled. Any dividends or distributions declared but unpaid at the time of
conversion with respect to a share of Series D Preferred so converted shall be
payable ratably to the holders of the Common issued upon such conversion.

4.6.4.3 Effective Date of Conversion.

4.6.4.3.1 Optional Conversion. The conversion of any shares of Series D
Preferred shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of
business on the date that the shares to be converted are surrendered to the Company
together with the notice required by Section 4.6.4.2.1, and the person or persons
entitled to receive the shares of Common issuable upon such conversion shall be
treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common
on such date.

4.6.4.3.2 Mandatory Conversion. The conversion of shares of Series D
Preferred shall take place upon the first to occur of the Series D Mandatory
Conversion Events, whether or not the certificates representing such shares of

H# 379497

-36-

Series D Preferred shal] have been surrendered, or new certificates representing the
shares of Common into which such shares have been converted shall have been
issued.

4.6.4.4 Adjustment of Conversion Price.

4.6.4.4.1 Subdivision or Combination of Shares. If the Company at any time
subdivides or combines the outstanding Common after the Filing Date, the Series D
Conversion Price shall be decreased, in the case of a subdivision, or increased, in
the case of a combination, in the same proportions as the Common is subdivided or
combined, effective automatically as of the date the Company shall take a record of
the holders of its Common for the purpose of the subdivision or combination (or if
no such record ts taken, as of the effectiveness of the subdivision or combination).

makes any other distribution, to holders of Common payable in shares of Common,
ot fixes a record date for the determination of holders of Common entitled to
receive a dividend or other distribution payable in shares of Common, the Series D
Conversion Price shall be decreased by multiplying it by a fraction:

4.6.4.4.2 Stock Dividends. If the Company at any time pays a dividend, or

(A) — the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common
outstanding immediately prior to such dividend or distribution, and

(B) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common
outstanding immediately after such dividend or distribution (plus, if the
Company paid cash instead of fractional shares otherwise issuable in such
dividend or distribution, the number of additional shares which would have been
outstanding had the Company issued fractional shares instead of cash),

effective automatically as of the date the Company shall take a record of the
holders of its Common for the purpose of receiving such dividend or distribution
(or if no such record is taken, as of the effectiveness of such dividend or
distribution).

4.6.4.4.3 Reclassification, Consolidation or Merger. If at any time, as a result

of:

(A) a capital reorganization or reclassification (other than a subdivision,
combination or dividend which gives rise to adjustment of the Series D
Conversion Price pursuant to Sections 4.6.4.4.1 or 4.6.4.4.2), or

(B) a merger or consolidation of the Company with another corporation
(whether or not the Company is the surviving corporation),

the Common issuable upon the conversion of the Series D Preferred shall be
changed into or exchanged for the same or a different number of shares of any
class or classes of stock of the Company or any other corporation, or other
securities convertible into such shares, then, as a part of such reorganization,
reclassification, merger or consolidation, appropriate adjustments shall be made
L1# 379497

-37-

in the terms of the Series D Preferred (or of any securities into which the Series
D Preferred is changed or for which the Series D Preferred is exchanged), so that:

{X) the holders of Series D Preferred or of such substitute securities shall
thereafter be entitled to receive, upon conversion of the Series D Preferred or of
such substitute securities, the kind and amount of shares of stock, other
securities, money and property which such holders would have received at the
time of such capital reorganization, reclassification, merger, or consolidation, if
such holders had converted their Series D Preferred into Common immediately
prior to such capital reorganization, reclassification, merger, or consolidation,
and

(Y) the Series D Preferred or such substitute securities shall thereafter be
adjusted on terms as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments
theretofore provided in this Section 4.6.4.4.

The provisions of this Section 4.6.4.4.3 shall similarly apply to successive capital
reorganizations, reclassifications, mergers, and consolidations.

4.6.4.4.4 Additional Shares of Common. If at any time the Company issues (or
is deemed by the express provisions of Section 4.3.4.4.5 to have issued or sold)
Additional Shares of Common without consideration or for a consideration per
share less than the lower of (i) the Series D Conversion Price in effect at such
issuance or (it) the Series E Conversion Price in effect at such issuance, then the
Series D Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issuance, to a
price (calculated to the nearest cent) equal to the price determined by multiplying
the Series D Conversion Price by a fraction:

(A) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common
Outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Shares of
Common plus the number of shares of Common which the aggregate
consideration received (or by the express provisions hereof deemed to have been
received) by the Company for the total number of such Additional Shares of
Common so issued would purchase at the Series D Conversion Price, and

(B) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common
Outstanding immediately after the issuance of such Additional Shares of
Common;

provided, however, that in no event shall the Series D Conversion Price be
reduced below $0.01.

4.6.4.4.5 Convertible Securities. For purposes of the adjustment required under
Section 4.6.4.4.4, Convertible Securities shall be treated as described in Section
4.3.4.4.5,

4.6.4.4.6 Valuation of Consideration. The value of consideration received by
the Company for any issue or sale of securities shall be determined as set forth in
Section 4.3.4.4.6.

4644.7  Liquidating Dividends. Subject to the preferential rights of holders of
Series E Preferred pursuant to Section 4.7.4.4.7, if the Company, at any time while
any of the Series D Preferred is outstanding, shall make a distribution of its assets
to the holders of its Common as a dividend in liquidation or partial liquidation or
by way of return of capital or other than as a dividend payable out of funds legally
available for dividends under the laws of the State of Delaware, the holders of the
Series D Preferred shall be entitled to receive, without payment of any
consideration therefor, the assets that would have been payable to them as owners
of that number of shares of Common receivable by exercise of such Series D
Conversion Rights, had they been the holders of record of such Common on the
record date for such distribution; and an appropriate provision therefor shall be
made a part of any such distribution in accordance with the preferential provisions
of Section 4.6.3 of this Restated Certificate.

4.6.4.5 Reservation of Shares. The Company will take such corporate action as may be
necessary from time to time so that at all times it will have authorized, and reserved out of its
authorized but unissued Common for the sole purpose of issuance upon conversion of shares of
Series D Preferred, a sufficient number of shares of Common to permit the conversion in full of
all outstanding shares of Series D Preferred.

4.6.4.6 Full Consideration. All shares of Common which shall be issued upon the conversion
of any Series D Preferred will, upon issuance, be fully paid and non-assessable. The Company
will pay such amounts and will take such other action as may be necessary from time to time so
that all shares of Common which shall be issued upon the exercise of the Series D Conversion
Right of any Series D Preferred will, upon issuance and without cost to the recipient, be free
from all preemptive rights, taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issue thereof.

4.6.4.7 Notice of Adjustment Events. Whenever the Company contemplates the occurrence of
an event which would give rise to adjustments under Section 4.6.4.4, the Company shall mail to
each holder of Series D Preferred, at least 20 days prior to the record date with respect to such
event or, if no record date shall be established, at least 20 days prior to such event, a notice
specifying (1) the nature of the contemplated event, and (ii) the date on which any such record
is to be taken for the purpose of such event, and (iti) the date on which such event is expected
to become effective, and (iv) the time, if any is to be fixed, when the holders of record of
Common (or other securities) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common (or other
securities) for securities or other property deliverable in connection with such event.

4.6.4.8 Notice of Adjustments. Whenever the Series D Conversion Price or the kind of
securities issuable upon the conversion of Series D Preferred, or both, shall be adjusted
pursuant to Section 4.7.4.4, the Company shall mail to each holder of Series D Preferred, by
first class mail postage prepaid, promptly after each adjustment, a certificate signed by its
President or a Vice President and by its Chief Financial Officer, Secretary or Assistant
Secretary, setting forth, in reasonable detail, the event requiring the adjustment, the amount of
the adjustment, the method by which such adjustment was calculated (including a description
of the basis on which the Board of Directors made any determination hereunder), and the Series
D Conversion Price and the kind of securities issuable upon the conversion of Series D
Preferred after giving effect to such adjustment.

on the Series E Preferred shall have been paid or declared and set apart during that fiscal year,
and no dividends (other than those payable on Common solely in shares of Common) shall be
paid on any share of Series D Preferred, Series C Preferred, Series B Preferred, Series A
Preferred or Common, unless a dividend is paid with respect to all outstanding shares of Series
E Preferred in an amount for each such share of Series E Preferred equal to or greater than the
aggregate amount of such dividends for all shares of Common into which each such share of
Series E Preferred could then be converted (assuming, for the purposes of calculating the
amount of dividends to be paid under this section, in the case of dividends declared on shares of
Series D Preferred, Series C Preferred, Series B Preferred or Series A Preferred, that such
shares of Series D Preferred, Series C Preterred, Series B Preferred or Series A Preferred, as
applicable, had been converted into shares of Common and such dividends had been declared
on the shares of Common issued upon conversion thereof).

4.7.2.3 In the event any dividend or other distribution payable in cash or other property (other
than securities of the Company the issuance of which gives rise to adjustments pursuant to
Section 4.7.4.4 of this Restated Certificate) is declared on any Common, each holder of shares
of Series E Preferred on the record date for such dividend or distribution shall be entitled to
receive, in addition to any dividend under 4.7.2.1, on the date of payment or distribution of
such dividend or other distribution the same cash or other property which such holder would
have received on such record date if such holder were the holder of record of the number
(including any fraction) of shares of Common into which the shares of Series E Preferred then
held by such holder are then convertible.

Liquidation Rights.

4.7.3.1 If the Company shall be voluntarily or involuntarily liquidated, dissolved or wound up,
the holder of each share of Series E Preferred then outstanding (including any fractional shares)
shall be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Company available for distribution to
shareholders, and before any payment or declaration and setting apart for payment of any
amount shall be made with respect to the Series D Preferred, Series C Preferred, Series B

Preferred, Series A Preferred or Common, an amount equal to (1) 100% of the Series E Original
Purchase Price (such amount to be adjusted proportionately in the event the shares of Series E
Preferred are subdivided into a greater number or combined into a lesser number), plus (ii) an
amount equal to 8% of the Series E Original Purchase Price per annum from the date of
issuance of such share of Series E Preferred plus (iii) any dividends on such share which are
declared but unpaid as of such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company (the sum
of clauses (i), (i) and (111), the “Series E Liquidation Preference”).

4.7.3.2 If, upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary
or involuntary, the assets to be distributed to the holders of Series E Preferred shall be
insufficient to permit the payment of the full Series E Liquidation Preference, then all of the
assets of the Company to be distributed shall be distributed ratably to the holders of Series E
Preferred, based upon the amounts which would otherwise be payable to such holders pursuant
to Section 4.7.3.1.

4.7.3.3, Upon the dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or
involuntary, the assets of the Company available for distribution to shareholders after and in
addition to the distribution of the preferential amounts pursuant to Sections 4.7.3.1, 4.6.3.1,
4.5.3.1, 4.4.3.1 and 4.3.3.1 of this Restated Certificate, shall be distributed ratably to all holders
of Common and Preferred on an as-converted basis.

4.7.3.4 Unless waived by the holders of at least the Series E Approval Amount, each of the
Deemed Liquidation Events specified in Section 4.3.3.4 shall be treated as a liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Company and shall entitle the holders of shares of all series of
Preferred and Common to receive at the closing in cash, securities or other property (valued as
provided in Sections 4.3.3.5, 4.4.3.5, 4.5.3.5, 4.6.3.5 and 4.7.3.5) the amounts specified in
Sections 4.3.3.1 through 4.3.3.5, 4.4.3.1 through 4.4.3.5, 4.5.3.1 through 4.5.3.5, 4.6.3.1
through 4.6.3.5 and 4.7.3.1 through 4.7.3.5.

4.7.3.5 Whenever the distribution provided for in this Section 4.7.3 shall be payable in
securities or property other than cash, the value of such distribution shall be the fair market
value of such securities or other property as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

Conversion.

4.7.4.1 Terms of Conversion.

4.7.4.1.1 Optional Conversion. The holder of each share of Series E Preferred
shall have the right (the "Series E Conversion Right"), at such holder's option, to
convert such share at any time, without cost and otherwise on the terms of this
Section 4.7.4, into the number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common
that results from dividing:

(A) the Series E Original Purchase Price,
by:

(B) the Series E Conversion Price (as defined below) in effect at the time of
conversion.
H# 379497

- 43 -

The "Series E Conversion Price” shall initially be $1.302333 and shall be
subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in this Section 4.7.4.

4.74.1.2 Mandatory Conversion. All of the outstanding Series E Preferred
shall, without any further action by a holder thereof, convert into Common (a
"Series E Mandatory Conversion") upon the first to occur of the following (each
a “Series E Mandatory Conversion Event’): (A) the Company's Qualified Public
Offering, (B) at such time as at least the Series E Approval Amount issued prior to
such time have been voluntarily converted into Common by the holders thereof,
(C) at such time as is specified in a vote or written consent of the holders of at least
the Series E Approval Amount, or (D) at such time as is specified in a vote or
written consent of the holders of at least the Series E Approval Amount with
respect to the conversion of all Preferred into Common. In each case, each share of
Series E, Preferred shal! be automatically converted, without cost, on the terms of
this Section 4.7.4, into the number of shares of Common into which such share of
Series E Preferred would be convertible under 4.7.4.].] immediately prior to such
conversion.

4.7.4.2 Mechanics of Conversion.

4.7.4.2.1_ Optional Conversion. A holder of any share of Series E Preferred may
exercise the Series E Conversion Right of such share by surrendering the certificate
therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Company or of any transfer agent for
the Series E Preferred, together with a written notice to the Company which states:

(A) that such holder elects to convert the same,
{B) the number of shares of Series E Preferred being converted, and

(C) the name or names in which such holder wishes the certificate or
certificates for shares of Common to be issued.

Thereupon the Company shall promptly issue and deliver to the holder of such
shares, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates
for the number of shares of Common to which such holder shall be entitled. If
the certificate evidencing the shares of Series E Preferred being converted shall
also evidence shares of Series E Preferred not being converted, then the
Company shall also deliver to the holder of such certificate, or to the nominee or
nominees of such holder, a new stock certificate evidencing the Series E
Preferred not converted. Any dividends or distributions declared but unpaid at
the time of conversion with respect to a share of Series E Preferred so converted
shall be payable ratably to the holders of the Common issued upon such
conversion.

4.7.4.2.2 Mandatory Conversion. The Company shall give written notice to
each holder of a share of Series E Preferred (A) not more than forty (40) nor less
than twenty (20) days before the anticipated effective date of the registration
statement with respect to any Qualified Public Offering, and shall also give written
notice to each such holder upon the occurrence of any Qualified Public Offering;
and (B) upon the occurrence of any other Series E Mandatory Conversion Event.
Li# 379497

- 44 -

Following the conversion of such shares, each holder of shares so converted may
surrender the certificate therefor at the office of the Company or any transfer agent
for the Series E Preferred. Upon such surrender, the Company shall issue and
deliver to each holder, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate
or certificates for the number of shares of Common to which such holder is
entitled. Any dividends or distributions declared but unpaid at the time of
conversion with respect to a share of Series E Preferred so converted shall be
payable ratably to the holders of the Common issued upon such conversion.

4.7.4.3 Effective Date of Conversion.

4.7.4.3.1 | Qptional Conversion. The conversion of any shares of Series E
Preferred shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of
business on the date that the shares to be converted are surrendered to the Company
together with the notice required by Section 4.7.4.2.1, and the person or persons
entitled to receive the shares of Common issuable upon such conversion shall be
treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common
on such date.

4.7.4.3.2 Mandatory Conversion. The conversion of shares of Series E Preferred
shall take place upon the first to occur of the Series E Mandatory Conversion
Events, whether or not the certificates representing such shares of Series E
Preferred shall have been surrendered, or new certificates representing the shares of

Common into which such shares have been converted shall have been issued.

4.7.4.4 Adjustment of Conversion Price.

4.7.4.4.1 Subdivision or Combination of Shares. If the Company at any time
subdivides or combines the outstanding Common after the Filing Date, the Series E
Conversion Price shall be decreased, in the case of a subdivision, or increased, in
the case of a combination, in the same proportions as the Common is subdivided or
combined, effective automatically as of the date the Company shall take a record of
the holders of its Common for the purpose of the subdivision or combination (or if
no such record is taken, as of the effectiveness of the subdivision or combination).

4.7.4.4.2 Stock Dividends. If the Company at any time pays a dividend, or
makes any other distribution, to holders of Common payabie in shares of Common,
or fixes a record date for the determination of holders of Common entitled to
receive a dividend or other distribution payable in shares of Common, the Series E
Conversion Price shall be decreased by multiplying it by a fraction:

(A) — the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common
outstanding immediately prior to such dividend or distribution, and

(B) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common
outstanding immediately after such dividend or distribution (plus, if the
Company paid cash instead of fractional shares otherwise issuable in such
dividend or distribution, the number of additional shares which would have been
outstanding had the Company issued fractional shares instead of cash),
lif 379497

effective automatically as of the date the Company shall take a record of the
holders of its Common for the purpose of receiving such dividend or distribution
(or if no such record is taken, as of the effectiveness of such dividend or
distribution).

4.74.43 Reclassification, Consolidation or Merger. If at any time, as a result
of:

(A) a capital reorganization or reclassification (other than a subdivision,
combination or dividend which gives rise to adjustment of the Series E
Conversion Price pursuant to Sections 4.7.4.4.] or 4.7.4.4.2), or

(B) a merger or consolidation of the Company with another corporation
(whether or not the Company is the surviving corporation),

the Common issuable upon the conversion of the Series E Preferred shall be
changed into or exchanged for the same or a different number of shares of any
class or classes of stock of the Company or any other corporation, or other
securities convertible into such shares, then, as a part of such reorganization,
reclassification, merger or consolidation, appropriate adjustments shall be made
in the terms of the Series E Preferred (or of any securities into which the Series E
Preferred is changed or for which the Series E Preferred is exchanged), so that:

(X) the holders of Series E Preferred or of such substitute securities shall
thereafter be entitled to receive, upon conversion of the Series E Preferred or of
such substitute securities, the kind and amount of shares of stock, other
securities, money and property which such holders would have received at the
time of such capital reorganization, reclassification, merger, or consolidation, if
such holders had converted their Series E Preferred into Common immediately
prior to such capital reorganization, reclassification, merger, or consolidation,
and

(Y) the Series E Preferred or such substitute securities shall thereafter be
adjusted on terms as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments
theretofore provided this Section 4.7.4.4.

The provisions of this Section 4.7.4.4.3 shall similarly apply to successive capital
reorganizations, reclassifications, mergers, and consolidations.

4.7.4.4.4 Additional Shares of Common. If the Company issues (or is deemed
by the express provisions of Section 4.3.4.4.5 to have issued or sold) Additional
Shares of Common without consideration or for a consideration per share less than
the Series E Conversion Price in effect at such issuance, then the Series EF
Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issuance, to a price
(calculated to the nearest cent) equal to the price determined by multiplying the
Series E Conversion Price by a fraction:

(A) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common
Outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Shares of
Common plus the number of shares of Common which the aggregate
H# 379497

- 46 -

consideration received (or by the express provisions hereof deemed to have been
received) by the Company for the total number of such Additional Shares of
Common so issued would purchase at the Series E Conversion Price, and

(B) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common
Outstanding immediately after the issuance of such Additional Shares of
Common;

provided, however, that in no event shall the Series E Conversion Price be
reduced below $0.01.

4.7.44.5 Convertible Securities. For purposes of the adjustment required under
Section 4.7.4.4.4, Convertible Securities shall be treated as described in Section
4.3.4.4.5.

4.7.4.4.6 Valuation of Consideration. The value of consideration received by
the Company for any issue or sale of securities shall be determined as set forth in
Section 4.3.4.4.6.

4.7.4.4.7  Liquidating Dividends. If the Company, at any time while any of the
Series E Preferred is outstanding, shall make a distribution of its assets to the
holders of its Common as a dividend in liquidation or partial liquidation or by way
of return of capital or other than as a dividend payable out of funds legally
available for dividends under the laws of the State of Delaware, the holders of the
Series E Preferred shall be entitled to receive, without payment of any
consideration therefor, the assets that would have been payable to them as owners
of that number of shares of Common receivable by exercise of such Series E
Conversion Rights, had they been the holders of record of such Common on the
record date for such distribution; and an appropriate provision therefor shal] be
made a part of any such distribution in accordance with the preferential provisions
of Section 4.7.3 of this Restated Certificate.

4.7.4.5 Reservation of Shares. The Company will take such corporate action as may be
necessary from time to time so that at all times it will have authorized, and reserved out of its
authorized but unissued Common for the sole purpose of issuance upon conversion of shares of
Series E Preferred, a sufficient number of shares of Common to permit the conversion in full of
all outstanding shares of Series E Preferred.

4.7.4.6 Full Consideration. All shares of Common which shall be issued upon the conversion
of any Series E Preferred will, upon issuance, be fully paid and non-assessable. The Company
will pay such amounts and will take such other action as may be necessary from time to time so
that all shares of Common which shall be issued upon the exercise of the Series E Conversion
Right of any Series E Preferred will, upon issuance and without cost to the recipient, be free
from all preemptive rights, taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issue thereof.

4.7.4.7 Notice of Adjustment Events. Whenever the Company contemplates the occurrence of
an event which would give rise to adjustments under Section 4.7.4.4, the Company shall mail to
each holder of Series E Preferred, at Jeast 20 days prior to the record date with respect to such
event or, if no record date shall be established, at least 20 days prior to such event, a notice
specifying (i) the nature of the contemplated event, and (ii) the date on which any such record

4.7.5

1i# 379497

-47-

is to be taken for the purpose of such event, and (iii) the date on which such event is expected
to become effective, and (iv) the time, if any is to be fixed, when the holders of record of
Common (or other securities) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common (or other
securities) for securities or other property deliverable in connection with such event.

4.7.4.8 Notice of Adjustments. Whenever the Series E Conversion Price or the kind of
securities issuable upon the conversion of Series E Preferred, or both, shall be adjusted
pursuant to Section 4.7.4.4, the Company shall mail to each holder of Scries E Preferred, by
first class mail postage prepaid, promptly after each adjustment, a certificate signed by its
President or a Vice President and by its Chief Financial Officer, Secretary or Assistant
Secretary, setting forth, in reasonable detail, the event requiring the adjustment, the amount of
the adjustment, the method by which such adjustment was calculated (including a description
of the basis on which the Board of Directors made any determination hereunder), and the Series
E Conversion Price and the kind of securities issuable upon the conversion of Series E
Preferred after giving effect to such adjustment.

Redemption.

4.7.5.1 "Redemption Trigger Date" has the meaning ascribed thereto in Section 4.3.5.1
above.

4.7.5.2 At any time on or after the Redemption Trigger Date, the holders of at least the Series
E Approval Amount shall have the right to elect to require the Company to redeem all
outstanding shares of Series E Preferred. Within not more than fifteen (15) business days after
receipt of written notice of such election (“Series E Redemption Election”), the Company will
provide a written notice (“Series E Redemption Notice”) advising each holder of Series E
Preferred of the proposed redemption in the form required under Section 4.7.5.3.1. The Board
of Directors shall establish the date on which the Series E Preferred will be redeemed (“Series
E Redemption Date”), which date will be not less than thirty (30) nor more than ninety (90)
days after the date the Company receives the Series E Redemption Election. On the Series E
Redemption Date, the Company will redeem for cash, out of funds legally available for such
purpose, all shares of Series E Preferred at a price per share equal to the Series E Liquidation
Preference (the "Series E Redemption Price").

4.7.5.2.1 The Series E Redemption Notice shall state:

(a) that the holders of at least the Series E Approval Amount have elected to
require the Company to redeem all outstanding shares of Series E Preferred,

(b) the amount of funds legally available for such redemption and the maximum
number of shares of Series E Preferred the Company can redeem,

(c) the Series E Redemption Date, and
(d) that each holder is to surrender to the Company in the manner designated at
the Company’s principal place of business, its certificate or certificates

representing the shares of Series E Preferred to be redeemed.

4.7.5.3 Each holder of shares of Series E Preferred being redeemed shall surrender the
certificate or certificates representing such shares to the Company, al the Company's principal
4.7.6

place of business. Upon such surrender (but not earlier than the Series E Redemption Date) the
Series EF Redemption Price for such shares of Series E Preferred shall be payable to the order of
the person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof, and each
surrendered certificate shall be cancelled and retired. If a certificate is surrendered and all the
shares evidenced thereby cannot be redeemed, the Company shall cause certificates evidencing
the shares not being redeemed to be issued in the name of the registered owner of such shares
and to be delivered to such person.

4.7.5.4 Jf the Series E Redemption Price is either paid or made available for payment through
the deposit arrangement specified in Section 4.7.5.5 with respect to any shares of Series E
Preferred, then notwithstanding that the certificates evidencing any of the shares to be
redeemed shall not have been surrendered, all rights with respect to such shares shall terminate
as of the Series E Redemption Date, except only the right of the holder to receive the Series [
Redemption Price upon surrender of the certificate evidencing such shares.

4.7.5.5 Within 10 business days of the Company's receipt of the Series E Redemption Election,
the Company shall deposit with any bank or trust company having a capital and surplus of at
least $50,000,000 as a trust fund, a sum equal to the aggregate Series E Redemption Price of all
outstanding shares of Series E Preferred with irrevocable instructions and authority to the bank
or trust company to pay, on or after the Series E Redemption Date, the Series E Redemption
Price to the respective holders of Series E Preferred upon the surrender of their share
certificates. From and after the date of such deposit, the shares so called for redemption shall
be redeemed. The deposit shall constitute full payment of the shares to their holders, and from
and after the Series E Redemption Date, the shares shall be deemed to be no longer
outstanding, and the holders thereof shall cease to be shareholders with respect thereto and shall
have no rights with respect thereto except the rights to receive from the bank or trust company
payment of the Series E Redemption Price of the shares, without interest, upon surrender of
their certificates therefor (and a certificate for those shares, if any, evidenced by such
certificates which are not being redeemed on such Series E Redemption Date). Any funds so
deposited and unclaimed at the end of one year from such Series E Redemption Date shall be
released or repaid to the Company, after which the former holders of the shares called for
redemption shall be entitled to receive payment of the Series E Redemption Price with respect
to such shares only from the Company.

4.7.5.6 If the funds of the Company legally available therefor shall be insufficient to discharge
the Series E Preferred redemption requirement in full, funds to the extent legally available for
such purpose shall be set aside upon the Company's receipt of a Series E Redemption Election
in accordance with Section 4.7.5.5. The maximum number of full shares of Series E Preferred
that can be redeemed with such funds shall be redeemed from the holders of shares of Series E
Preferred as of the date of such Series E Redemption Election ratably in accordance with the
full amounts otherwise payable to them. Thereafter, the Company shall redeem shares of
Series E Preferred ratably from the holders thereof as funds legally available therefor become
available.

Nothing in this Section 4.7.5 shall prevent any holder of shares of Series E Preferred from
exercising the Series E Conversion Right of such shares at any time prior to the actual
redemption of such shares.

No Reissuance of Series E Preferred. No share or shares of Series E Preferred acquired by the
Company by reason of redemption, purchase, conversion or otherwise shall be reissued, and all
4.7.7

4.8

- 49 -

such shares shall be canceled, retired and eliminated from the shares which the Company shall
be authorized to issue.

Protective Provisions. For so long as any shares of Series E Preferred remain outstanding,
consent of the holders of at least the Series E Approval Amount shal] be required for any
action, either directly or indirectly by amendment, merger, consolidation or otherwise, that (1)
alters or changes the rights, preferences or privileges of any series of Preferred, (ii) increases or
decreases the authorized number of shares of Series E Preferred, (iti) increases or decreases the
authorized number of shares of Common or Preferred, (iv) creates (by reclassification or
otherwise) any new class or series of shares having rights, preferences or privileges senior to or

existing indebtedness of the Company. If any of the actions specified in clauses (i) through (xii)
above are entered into without the consent of the holders of at least the Series E Approval

4.8.1

4.8.2

H# 379497

If a holder of Preferred does not invest any amount which such holder of Preferred has
committed to invest (a “Committed Amount’) pursuant to the terms of the Series E Purchase
Agreement when such amounts are required by the terms of the Series E Purchase Agreement
to be invested, then, provided the default is still occurring and the Committed Amount has not
been funded, on the tenth (10") day following written notice by the Company of such default
(the “Conversion Date’), each share of Series E Preferred heid by such holder, or previously
held by such holder and subsequently transferred, shall automatically convert into one tenth
(1/10" ) the number of shares of Common into which such share of Series E Preferred would
have converted pursuant to Section 4.7.4 on the day immediately preceding the Conversion
Date.

Promptly following the Conversion Date, the holder of shares so converted shall surrender the
certificates therefor at the office of the Company or any transfer agent for the Preferred. Upon
such surrender the Company shall issue and deliver to such holder, or to the nominee or
nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common to
which such holder is entitled. Ifa holder’s shares of Series E Preferred are converted pursuant
to this Section 4.8, then notwithstanding that the certificates evidencing such shares shall not
have been surrendered, all rights with respect to such shares shall terminate on the Conversion
Date, except only the right of the holder upon surrender of the certificates evidencing such
converted shares to receive certificates evidencing the shares of Common issued upon such
conversion.

4.8.3 All shares of Common issued to any holder of Preferred as a result of conversion pursuant to
this Section 4.8 shall be aggregated for the purpose of determining the number of shares of
Common to which such holder shall be entitled, and no fractional shares shall be issued in
connection with such conversion. No cash in licu of any fractional share shall be paid to any
stockholder as a result of conversion pursuant to this Section 4.8. In determining whether a
Purchaser has satisfied the criteria set forth in Section 4.8.1, any purchases of Series F
Preferred under the Series E Purchase Agreement by a Related Party (as defined in the Series E
Purchase Agreement) of such Purchaser that are in excess of such Related Party’s obligations
under the Serics E Purchase Agreement, if any, shall, to the extent requested by such Related
Party be attributed to such Purchaser; provided that no shares constituting part of such excess
shall be attributed to more than one person or entity.

of (and advancement of expenses to) directors of the Company (and any other persons to which the
General Corporation Law permits the Company to provide indemnification) through Bylaw provisions,
agreements with such directors or other persons, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or
otherwise, in excess of the indemnification and advancement otherwise permitted by Section 145 of the
