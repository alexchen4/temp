Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive dividends, when, as and if declared by the Board of
Directors, out of any assets at the time legally available therefor, at the Dividend Rate specified for
such series of Preferred Stock, payable in preference and priority to any declaration or payment of
any Distribution on Common Stock of the Corporation in such calendar year. No Distributions shall
be made with respect to the Common Stock until all declared dividends on the Preferred Stock have

C:\Documents and Settings\pgillespie\Local Settings\Temporary Intemet Files\OLK5F\ActiveGrid - Series B Extension COL (PALIB2_3662618_1),DOC -3-
Preferred Stock by reason of the fact that dividends on said shares are not declared or paid in any

(b) Additional Dividends. After the payment or setting aside for payment of the
dividends described in Section 2(a), any additional dividends (other than dividends on Common

Section 4 hereof).

(c) Non-Cash Distributions. Whenever a Distribution provided for in this Section 2

fair market value of such property as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, including
the consent of at least one Series A Director and the Series B Director (as defined in paragraph 5(d)).

(d) Consent to Certain Distributions. As authorized by Section 402.5(c) of the -
California Corporations Code, if Section 502 or Section 503 of the California Corporations Code is
applicable to a payment made by the Corporation, then such applicable section or sections shall not
apply if such payment is a payment made by the Corporation in connection with (i) repurchases of
Common Stock issued to or held by employees, officers, directors or consultants of the Corporation
or its subsidiaries at cost upon termination of their employment or services pursuant to agreements
providing for the right of said repurchase, (ii) repurchases of Common Stock issued to or held by
employees, officers, directors or consultants of the Corporation or its subsidiaries pursuant to rights

3. Liquidation Rights.

(a) Liquidation Preference. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up
of the Corporation, either voluntary or involuntary, the holders of the Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to receive, on a pari passu basis and prior and in preference to any Distribution of any of the
assets of the Corporation to the holders of the Common Stock by reason of their ownership of such
stock, an amount per share for each share of Preferred Stock held by them equal to the sum of (i) the
Liquidation Preference specified for such share of Preferred Stock and (ii) all declared but unpaid
dividends (if any) on such share of Preferred Stock. If upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding
up of the Corporation, the assets of the Corporation legally available for distribution to the holders of
the Preferred Stock are insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full amounts
specified in this Section 3(a), then the entire assets of the Corporation legally available for
distribution shall be distributed with equal priority and pro rata among the holders of the Preferred
Stock in proportion to the full amounts they would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to this
Section 3(a).

CADocuments and Settings\pgillespie\Local Settings\Temporary Intemet Files\OLKSF\ActiveGrid - Series B Extension CO]_(PALIB2_3662618_1).DOC -4-
(b) Remaining Assets. After the payment to the holders of Preferred Stock of the full
preferential amounts specified above, the entire remaining assets of the Corporation legally available
for distribution by the Corporation shall be distributed with equal priority and pro rata among the
holders of the Preferred Stock and Common Stock in proportion to the number of shares of Common
Stock held by them, with the shares of Preferred Stock being treated for this purpose as if they had
been converted to shares of Common Stock at the then applicable Conversion Rate.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the aggregate distributions made pursuant to one or more
subsections of this Section 3 with respect to any share of Preferred Stock shall not exceed an amount
equal to three times the applicable Liquidation Preference specified for such share of Preferred Stock
plus any declared but unpaid dividends.

(c) Treatment of Preferred Stock in any Distribution. Notwithstanding anything in
this Section 3 to the contrary, if upon any Liquidation Transaction (as defined below) a holder of
Preferred Stock would receive a greater Distribution by converting such holder’s shares of Preferred
Stock into Common Stock than such holder would be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3(a) or
3(b) as a holder of Preferred Stock, then such holder shall not receive any amounts under such
subsections as a holder of Preferred Stock, but shall be treated, for the purposes of determining such
holder’s rights under Sections 3(a) or 3(b) only, as though such holder held, in addition to any shares
of Common Stock then actually held by such holder, such number of shares of Common stock that
such holder would hold if such holder had then converted such holder’s shares of Preferred Stock
into Common Stock, effective immediately prior to the Liquidation Transaction, at the then
applicable Conversion Rate (as defined below). For the avoidance of doubt, however, in no event
shall any holder of Preferred Stock be entitled to convert its shares of Preferred Stock in order to
participate in any Distribution, or series of Distributions, as shares of Common Stock, without first
foregoing participation in the Distribution, or series of Distributions, as shares of Preferred Stock.

(d) Reorganization. For purposes of this Section 3, a liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation shall be deemed to be occasioned by, or to include, (i) the acquisition
of the Corporation by another entity by means of any transaction or series of related transactions
(including, without limitation, any stock acquisition, reorganization, merger or consolidation but
excluding any sale of stock for capital raising purposes) other than a transaction or series of
transactions in which the holders of the voting securities of the Corporation outstanding immediately
prior to such transaction continue to retain (either by such voting securities remaining outstanding or
by such voting securities being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity), without one
or more holder’s ownership relative to the other holders increasing or decreasing materially after
such transaction or series of transactions, as a result of shares in the Corporation held by such
holders prior to such transaction, at least fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power represented by
the voting securities of the Corporation or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such
transaction or series of transactions; (ii) a sale, lease, assignment, transfer or other conveyance of, or
the grant of an irrevocable and exclusive license to, all or substantially all of the assets of the
Corporation; or (iii) any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, whether voluntary
or involuntary, (each such transaction, a “Liquidation Transaction”). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the holders of at least 66-2/3% of the then outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock

C:\Documents and Settings\pgillespie\Local Settings\Temporary Intemet Files\OLK5F\ActiveGrid - Series B Extension COI (PALIB2_3662618_1).DOC -5-
may waive the treatment of a Liquidation Transaction as a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of
the Corporation.

(e) Valuation of Non-Cash Consideration. If any assets of the Corporation
distributed to stockholders in connection with any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the
Corporation are other than cash, then the value of such assets shall be their fair market value as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, including the consent of at least one Series A
Director and the Series B Director; provided, however, that any publicly-traded securities to be
distributed to stockholders in a liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation shall be
valued as follows:

(i) If the securities are then traded on a national securities exchange or the
Nasdaq Stock Market (or a similar national quotation system), then the value of the securities shall
be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange or system over
the ten (10) trading day period ending five (5) trading days prior to the Distribution;

(ii) if the securities are actively traded over-the-counter, then the value of
the securities shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid prices of the securities over the ten
(10) trading day period ending five (5) trading days prior to the Distribution.

In the event of a merger or other acquisition of the Corporation by another entity, the
Distribution date shall be deemed to be the date such transaction closes,

For the purposes of this subsection 3(e), “trading day” shall mean any day which the
exchange or system on which the securities to be distributed are traded is open and “closing prices”
or “closing bid prices” shall be deemed to be: (i) for securities traded primarily on the New York
Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market, the last reported trade
price or sale price, as the case may be, at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on that day and (ii) for
securities listed or traded on other exchanges, markets and systems, the market price as of the end of
the regular hours trading period that is generally accepted as such for such exchange, market or
system. If, after the date hereof, the benchmark times generally accepted in the securities industry
for determining the market price of a stock as of a given trading day shall change from those set
forth above, the fair market value shall be determined as of such other generally accepted benchmark
times.

4. Conversion. The holders of Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as follows (the
“Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option
of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share at the office of the
Corporation or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, into that number of fully-paid,
nonassessable shares of Common Stock determined by dividing the Original Issue Price for the
relevant series of Preferred Stock by the Conversion Price for such series. (The number of shares of
Common Stock into which each share of Preferred Stock may be converted is hereinafter referred to
as the “Conversion Rate”.) Upon any decrease or increase in the Conversion Price specified for the

C:\Documents and Settings\pgillespie\Local Settings\Temporary Internet Files\OLK5F\ActiveGrid - Series B Extension COI_{PALIB2_3662618_1}.DOC -6-
relevant series of Preferred Stock, as described in this Section 4, the Conversion Rate for such series
shall be appropriately increased or decreased.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be
converted into fully-paid, non-assessable shares of Common Stock at the then effective Conversion
Rate specified for such series of Preferred Stock (i) immediately prior to the closing of a firm
commitment underwritten initial public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement filed
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), covering the offer and sale of
the Corporation’s Common Stock, provided that the offering price per share is not less than three (3)
times the Original Issue Price (as adjusted for Recapitalizations) of the Series B Preferred Stock and
the aggregate gross proceeds to the Corporation are not less than $20,000,000 (a “Qualified
Offering”), or (ii) upon the receipt by the Corporation of a written request for such conversion from
the holders of 66-2/3% of the Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding and 66-2/3% of the Series B
Preferred Stock then outstanding, each voting as a separate class, or, if later, the effective date for
conversion specified in such requests (each of the events referred to in (i) and (ii) are referred to
herein as an “Automatic Conversion Event”).

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued
upon conversion of the Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would
otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the then
fair market value of a share of Common Stock as determined by the Board of Directors, including
the consent of at least one Series A Director and the Series B Director. For such purpose, all shares
of Preferred Stock held by each holder of Preferred Stock shall! be aggregated, and any resulting
fractional share of Common Stock shall be paid in cash. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall
be entitled to convert the same into full shares of Common Stock, and to receive certificates therefor,
he shall either (i) surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the
Corporation or of any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock or (ii) notify the Corporation or its
transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and execute an agreement
reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it
in connection with such certificates, and shall give written notice to the Corporation at such office
that he elects to convert the same; provided, however, that on the date of an Automatic Conversion
Event, the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically without any further
action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates representing such shares are
surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent; provided further, however, that the Corporation
shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon
such Automatic Conversion Event unless either the certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred
Stock are delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent as provided above, or the holder notifies
the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and
executes an agreement reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from
any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates. On the date of the occurrence of an
Automatic Conversion Event, each holder of record of shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to
be the holder of record of the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, notwithstanding that
the certificates representing such shares of Preferred Stock shall not have been surrendered at the
office of the Corporation, that notice from the Corporation shall not have been received by any

C:\Documents and Settings\pgillespie\Local Settings\Temporary Intemet Files\OLKSF\ActiveGrid - Series B Extension COIl(PALIB2_3662618_1).DOC ~7]-
holder of record of shares of Preferred Stock, or that the certificates evidencing such shares of
Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered to such holder.

The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after such delivery, or after such agreement and
indemnification, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as
aforesaid and a check payable to the holder in the amount of any cash amounts payable as the result
of a conversion into fractional shares of Common Stock, plus any declared and unpaid dividends on
the relevant series of converted Preferred Stock. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been
made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of
Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common
Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders
of such shares of Common Stock on such date; provided, however, that if the conversion is in
connection with an underwritten offer of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act or a
merger, sale, financing, or liquidation of the Corporation or other Liquidation Transaction, the
conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned
upon the closing of such transaction or upon the occurrence of such event, in which case the .
person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of Preferred Stock
shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of
such transaction or the occurrence of such event.

(d) Adjustments to Conversion Price for Diluting Issues.

(i) Special Definition. For purposes of this paragraph 4(d), “Additional
Shares of Common” shall mean al! shares of Common Stock issued (or, pursuant to paragraph
4(d)(iii), deemed to be issued) by the Corporation after the filing of this Second Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation, other than issuances or deemed issuances of:

acquisition of another corporation by the Corporation by merger, purchase of stock, purchase of
substantially all of the assets or other reorganization or to a joint venture agreement, provided that
such issuances are approved by the Board of Directors, including the consent of at least one Series A
Director and the Series B Director;

(6) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable to banks, equipment

party service providers in connection with the provision of goods or services pursuant to transactions
approved by the Board of Directors, including the consent of a majority of the Preferred Directors;
and

(10) shares of Common Stock, the issuance of which is approved by
the holders of at least 66 2/3% percent of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock,
each voting as a separate class. .

(ii) No Adjustment of Conversion Price. No adjustment in the Conversion
Price shall be made in respect of the issuance of Additional Shares of Common unless the
consideration per share (as determined pursuant to paragraph 4(d)(v)) for an Additional Share of
Common issued or deemed to be issued by the Corporation is less than the Conversion Price in
effect on the date of, and immediately prior to such issue, specified for the relevant series of
Preferred Stock.

(iii) Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the date of the filing of this Second Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall issue any Options or Convertible Securities or shall fix a
record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive any such
Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of shares (as set forth in the
instrument relating thereto without regard to any provisions contained therein for a subsequent
adjustment of such number) of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Options or, in the
case of Convertible Securities, the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities or, in the
case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options and the conversion or

C:\Documents and Settings\pgillespie\Local Settings\Temporary Intemet Files\OLK5F\ActiveGrid - Series B Extension COL_(PALIB2_3662618_1).DOC -9..
exchange of the underlying securities, shall be deemed to have been issued as of the time of such
issue or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record
date, provided that in any such case in which shares are deemed to be issued:

(1) no further adjustment in the Conversion Price specified for the
relevant series of Preferred Stock shall be made upon the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities
or shares of Common Stock in connection with the exercise of such Options or conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities;

(2) if such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms provide,
with the passage of time or otherwise, for any change in the consideration payable to the Corporation
or in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange
thereof (other than a change pursuant to the anti-dilution provisions of such Options or Convertible
Securities such as this Section 4(d) or pursuant to Recapitalization provisions of such Options or
Convertible Securities such as Sections 4(e), 4(f) and 4(g) hereof), the Conversion Price specified for
the relevant series of Preferred Stock and any subsequent adjustments based thereon shall be
recomputed to reflect such change as if such change had been in effect as of the original issue
thereof (or upon the occurrence of the record date with respect thereto);

(3) no readjustment pursuant to clause (2) above shall have the effect
of increasing the Conversion Price specified for the relevant series of Preferred Stock to an amount
above the Conversion Price for such series that would have resulted from any other issuances of _
Additional Shares of Common and any other adjustments provided for herein between the original
adjustment date and such readjustment date;

(4) upon the expiration of any such Options or any rights of
conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have been exercised, the
Conversion Price specified for the relevant series of Preferred Stock computed upon the original
issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto) and any subsequent
adjustments based thereon shall, upon such expiration, be recomputed as if:

(a) in the case of Convertible Securities or Options for
Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common issued were the shares of Common Stock, if
any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities and the consideration received therefor was the consideration actually
received by the Corporation for the issue of such exercised Options plus the consideration actually
received by the Corporation upon such exercise or for the issue of all such Convertible Securities
which were actually converted or exchanged, plus the additional consideration, if any, actually
received by the Corporation upon such conversion or exchange, and

(b) in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, only the
Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were issued at the time of
issue of such Options, and the consideration received by the Corporation for the Additional Shares of
Common deemed to have been then issued was the consideration actually received by the
Corporation for the issue of such exercised Options, plus the consideration deemed to have been

C:\Documents and Settings\pgillespie\Local Settings\Temporary Intemet Files\OLK5F\ActiveGrid - Series B Extension COL (PALIB2_3662618_1).DOC -10-
received by the Corporation (determined pursuant to Section 4(d)(v)) upon the issue of the
Convertible Securities with respect to which such Options were actually exercised; and

(5) if such record date shall have been fixed and such Options or
Convertible Securities are not issued on the date fixed therefor, the adjustment previously made in
the Conversion Price specified for the relevant series of Preferred Stock which became effective on
such record date shall be canceled as of the close of business on such record date, and thereafter such
Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this paragraph 4(d)(iii) as of the actual date of their
issuance. .

(iv) Adjustment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional Shares
of Common. In the event this Corporation shall issue Additional Shares of Common (including

Additional Shares of Common deemed to be issued pursuant to paragraph 4(d)(iii)) without
consideration or for a consideration per share less than the applicable Conversion Price specified for
the relevant series of Preferred Stock in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such issue,
then, such Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to
the nearest cent) determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of
which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue
plus the number of shares which the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for the
total number of Additional Shares of Common so issued would purchase at such Conversion Price,
and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to such issue plus the number of such Additional Shares of Common so issued.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Conversion Price specified for the relevant series of Preferred
Stock shall not be reduced at such time if the amount of such reduction would be less than $0.01, but
any such amount shall be carried forward, and a reduction will be made with respect to such amount
at the time of, and together with, any subsequent reduction which, together with such amount and
any other amounts so carried forward, equal $0.01 or more in the aggregate. For the purposes of this
Subsection 4(d)(iv), all shares of outstanding Common Stock, as well as all shares of Common Stock
issuable upon conversion of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock and the exercise and/or
conversion of any other outstanding Convertible Securities and all outstanding Options shall be
deemed to be outstanding.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this subsection 4(d),
the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue (or deemed issue) of any Additional
Shares of Common shall be computed as follows:

(1) Cash and Property. Such consideration shall:

(a) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the aggregate
amount of cash received by the Corporation before deducting any reasonable discounts,
commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the Corporation for any underwriting or
otherwise in connection with such issuance;

(b) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair market value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith by

C:\Documents and Settings\pgillespie\Local Settings\Temporary Intemet Files\OLK5F\ActiveGrid - Series B Extension COI (PALIB2_3662618_1).DOC -l1-
the Board of Directors, including the consent of at least one Series A Director and the Series B
Director; and

(c) in the event Additional Shares of Common are issued
together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for consideration which
covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in clauses (a)
and (b) above, as reasonably determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, including the
consent of at least one Series A Director and the Series B Director.

(2) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per share
received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common deemed to have been issued pursuant
to paragraph 4(d)(iii) shall be determined by dividing

(x) __ the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Corporation as
consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the minimum aggregate
amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to
any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration) payable to the
Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options for
Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities by

instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent
adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities.

(e) Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of Common Stock. In the event
the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided (by stock split, by payment of a stock
dividend or otherwise) into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price of
each series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall, concurrently
with the effectiveness of such subdivision, be proportionately decreased. In the event the
outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined (by reclassification or otherwise) into a
lesser number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock in
effect immediately prior to such combination shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such
combination, be proportionately increased.

(f) Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of Preferred Stock. In the event
the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock or any series of Preferred Stock shall be subdivided (by

Preferred Stock, the Dividend Rate, Original Issue Price and Liquidation Preference of the affected
series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall, concurrently with the
effectiveness of such subdivision, be proportionately decreased. In the event the outstanding shares

such combination shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination, be proportionately
increased. :

(g) Adjustments for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. If the Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock or a series of Preferred Stock shall be changed

into the same or a different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock, whether by
capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of
shares provided for above or pursuant to a Liquidation Transaction), then, in any such event, in lieu
of the number of shares of Common Stock which the holders would otherwise have been entitled to
receive, each holder of the affected series of Preferred Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert
~ such shares of Preferred Stock into a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock which a
holder of the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of such series of
Preferred Stock immediately before that change would have been entitled to receive in such
reorganization or reclassification, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein with respect to
such other shares.

(h) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of a Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation at its expense shall
promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish
to each holder of the affected series of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or
readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based.
The Corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock, furnish |
or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and
readjustments, (ii) the Conversion Price at the time in effect for such Preferred Stock and (iii) the
number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time
would be received upon the conversion of such Preferred Stock.

(i) Waiver of Adjustment of Conversion Price. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary in this Section 4, any downward adjustment of the Conversion Price of any series of
Preferred Stock may be waived by the written consent or vote of the holders of 66 2/3% of the
outstanding shares of such series of Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, either before or after
the issuance causing such adjustment.

(j) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at all
times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock solely

for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of Preferred Stock, such number of its
shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of
its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such
number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.

(k) No Impairment. The Corporation will not, by amendment of its certificate of
incorporation or through any reorganization, recapitalization, transfer of assets, consolidation,

the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the
Corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this
Section 4 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect
the conversion rights of the holders of Preferred Stock against impairment. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Section 4(k) shall prohibit the Corporation from amending its Certificate
of Incorporation in accordance with applicable law and with the requisite consent of its stockholders
and the Board of Directors. .

entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend) or other distribution, any right to
subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of stock of any class or any other securities
or property, to receive any other right, or to exchange their shares of Common Stock or Preferred
Stock (or other securities) for securities or other property deliverable upon a reorganization,
reclassification, consolidation, merger, dissolution, liquidation or winding up, the Corporation shall
mail to each holder of Preferred Stock, at least 20 days prior to the date specified therein, a notice
specifying the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend,
distribution, right or other exchange, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution,
right or other exchange.
