B3499024.2 -3-
or exchanged for shares of capital stock which represent, immediately following such
merger or consolidation, a majority, by voting power, of the capital stock of (1) the
surviving or resulting corporation or (2) if the surviving or resulting corporation is 2
wholly owned subsidiary of another corporation immediately following such merger or

or other disposition is to a wholly owned subsidiary of the Corporation.

33. Conversion. The holders of Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights
as follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Series A Preferred shall be
convertible at the option of the holder thereof at any time after the date of issuance and
without the payment of any additional consideration therefor into that number of fully
paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing $1.68
(appropriately adjusted to take account of any stock split, stock dividend, subdivision,
combination of shares, or the like) in the case of shares of Series A Preferred, $1.848
(appropriately adjusted to take account of any stock split, stock dividend, subdivision,
combination of shares, or the like) in the case of shares of Series A-} Preferred, and
$0.75 (appropriately adjusted to take account of any stock split, stock dividend,
subdivision, combination of shares or the like) in the case of shares of each of Series A-2
Preferred and Series A-3 Preferred by the Conversion Price of the Series A Preferred,
Series A-1 Preferred, Series A-2 Preferred or Series A-3 Preferred respectively, in effect
at the time of conversion. The Conversion Price of the Series A Preferred as of the
Original Issue Date shall be $0.56, the Conversion Price of the Series A-1 Preferred as of
the Original Issue Date shall be $0.616 and the Conversion Price of each of the Series A-
2 Preferred and Series A-3 Preferred as of the Original Issue Date shall be $0.75. Each
Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment (in order to adjust the number of shares
of Common Stock into which shares of the applicable series of Preferred Stock are
convertible) as hereinafter provided. Each person so converting shares of Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to all declared but unpaid dividends applicable to such shares of
Preferred Stock up to the time of the conversion thereof. Such dividends shall be paid to
such person within thirty (30) days of the date of conversion of such shares.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall
automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the then effective Conversion
Price for such share of Preferred Stock upon:

(i) the closing of a firm commitment underwritten public
offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended, covering the offer and sale of the Company’s Common Stock to the public,
for the account of the Company, at a public offering price of at least $2.25 per share, with
such amount to be appropriately adjusted to take account of any stock split, stock

B3499024.2 -4-
dividend, subdivision, combination of shares, or the like, and having an aggregate
offering price to the public of not less than $40,000,000; or

(ii) the written consent of the holders of at least two-thirds in
voting power of the Preferred Stock outstanding at that time.

The person(s) entitled to receive Common Stock issuable upon a conversion of
shares of Preferred Stock hereunder shall not be deemed to have converted such shares of
Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such offering or the receipt by
the Corporation of such consent. Each person who holds of record shares of Preferred
Stock immediately prior to an automatic conversion shall be entitled to all declared but
unpaid dividends up to the time of the automatic conversion. Such dividends shall be
paid to all such holders within thirty (30) days of the automatic conversion.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of Common Stock
shall be issued upon conversion of shares of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional
shares to which a holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shal! pay cash
equal to such fraction multiplied by the then effective applicable Conversion Price.
Before any holder of shares of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into
full shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates
therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for the
Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the Corporation at such office that such
holder elects to convert the same and shall state therein his name or the name or names of
his nominees in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of
Common Stock to be issued, together with the applicable federal taxpayer identification
number. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such
office to such holder of shares of Preferred Stock, or to his nominee or nominees, a
certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which he shall be
entitled, together with cash in lieu of any fraction of a share. Subject to Section 3.3(b)
above, such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the
close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be
converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders
of such shares of Common Stock on such date.

(d) Adjustments to Conversion Price for Diluting Issues:

(i) Special Definitions. For purposes of Section 3.3(d) and
Section 3.4, the following definitions shall apply:

(1) “Option” shall mean rights, options or warrants to
subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire either Common Stock or Convertible
Securities.

(2) “Original Issue Date” shall mean July 22, 2008.

for Common Stock.

(4) “Additional Shares of Common Stock” shall mean all
shares of Common Stock issued (or, pursuant to Section 3.3(d){iii), deemed to be issued)
by the Corporation after the Original Issue Date, other than shares of Common Stock
issued or issuable:

(A) upon conversion of shares of Preferred Stock or by way of
dividend or distribution on shares of Preferred Stock;

of such corporation or other entity in a transaction approved by a majority of the
members of the Board of Directors.

(ii) No Adjustment of Conversion Price, No adjustment in the
number of shares of Common Stock into which a particular series of Preferred Stock is
convertible shall be made by adjustment in the Conversion Price of such series of
Preferred Stock in respect of the issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock or
otherwise, (A) unless the consideration per share for such Additional Shares of Common
Stock issued or deemed to be issued by the Corporation is less than the Conversion Price
of such series of Preférred Stock in effect on the date of, and immediately prior to, the
issue of such Additional Shares of Common Stock or (B) if prior to such issuance or
within twenty (20) days thereafter the Corporation receives notice from the holders of at
least two-thirds in voting power of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock that no such
adjustment in such Conversion Price shall be made.

(iii) Issue of Securities Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of
Common Stock,

(1) Options and Convertible Seourities. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall issue any
Options or Convertible Securities or shall fix a record date for the determination of
holders of any class of securities entitled to receive any such Options or Convertible
Securities, then the maximum number of shares (as set forth in the instrument relating

B3499024.2 -6-
thereto without regard to any provisions contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of
such number) of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Options or, in the
case of Convertible Securities and Options therefor, the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to be Additional Shares of Common Stock issued
as of the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the
close of business on such record date, provided that Additional Shares of Common Stock
shall not be deemed to have been issued if such shares of Common Stock are excluded
from the definition of Additional Shares of Common Stock set forth in Section
3.3(d)(i)(4); and provided, however, that in any such case in which Additional Shares of
Common Stock are deemed to be issued:

(A)no further adjustment in any Conversion Price shall be
made upon the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities or shares of Common Stock
upon the exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities;

(B) if such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms
provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any increase in the consideration
payable to the Corporation, or decrease in the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable, upon the exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, the Conversion Price of each
series of Preferred Stock computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon the
occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based
thereon, shall, upon any such increase or decrease becoming effective, be recomputed to
reflect such increase or decrease insofar as it affects such Options or the rights of
conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities;

(C) upon the expiration of any such Options or any rights of
conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have been
exercised, the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock computed upon the
original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto) and
any subsequent adjustments based thereon shall, upon such expiration, be recomputed as
if:

(i) in the case of Convertible Securities or Options for
Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common Stock issued were the shares of
Common Stock, if any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities and the consideration received
therefor was the consideration actually received by the Corporation for the issue of all
such Options, whether or not exercised, plus the consideration actually received by the
Corporation upon such exercise, or for the issue of all such Convertible Securities which
were actually converted or exchanged, plus the additional consideration, if any, actually
received by the Corporation upon such conversion or exchange, and

(ii) in the case of Options for Convertible Securities,
only the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were
issued at the time of issue of such Options, and the consideration received by the
Corporation for the Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been then

B3499024.2 -7-
issued was the consideration actually received by the Corporation for the issue of all such
Options, whether or not exercised, plus the consideration deemed to have been received
by the Corporation (determined pursuant to Section 3.3(d)(v)) upon the issue of the
Convertible Securities with respect to which such Options were actually exercised;

(D) no readjustment pursuant to clause (B) or (C) above shall
have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price of either series of Preferred Stock to an
amount which exceeds the lower of (i) the Conversion Price of such series of Preferred
Stock on the original adjustment date, or (ii) the Conversion Price of such series of
Preferred Stock that would have resulted from any other issuance of Additional Shares of
Common Stock between the original adjustment date and such readjustment date;

(E) in the case of any Options which expire by their terms not
more than thirty (30) days after the date of issue thereof, no adjustment of the Conversion
Price of either series of Preferred Stock shall be made until the expiration or exercise of
all such Options, whereupon such adjustment shall be made in the same manner provided
in clause (C) above; and

(F) if such record date shall have been fixed and such Options
or Convertible Securities are not issued on the date fixed therefor, the adjustment
previously made in the Conversion Price of either series of Preferred Stock which
became effective on such record date shall be canceled as of the close of business on such
record date, and thereafter the Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock shall be
adjusted pursuant to this Section 3.3(d)(iii) as of the actual date of their issuance.

(2) Stock Dividends, Stock Distributions and Subdivisions. In
the event the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date
shall declare or pay any dividend or make any other distribution on the Common Stock
payable in Common Stock, or effect a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common
Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in Common Stock),
then and in any such event, Additional Shares of Common Stock shall not be deemed to
have been issued, but the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock shall be
adjusted in accordance with Section 3.3(d)(vi).

(iv) Adjustment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of

Additional Shares of Common Stock. In the event the Corporation shall issue Additional
Shares of Common Stock (including Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to be
issued pursuant to Section 3.3(d)(iii)) without consideration or for a consideration per
share less than the Conversion Price of a particular series of Preferred Stock in effect on
the date of and immediately prior to such issue, then and in such event, such Conversion
Price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue in order to increase the number of
shares of Common Stock into which such series of Preferred Stock is convertible, to a
price (calculated to the nearest cent) determined by dividing (A) (i) such Conversion
Price multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to such issue (including shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of any
outstanding Options, Convertible Securities and shares of Preferred Stock), plus (ii) the
aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for the total number of Additional

B3499024.2 -8-
Shares of Common Stock so issued, by (B) (i) the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such issue (including shares of Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of any outstanding Options, Convertible Securities and shares of
Preferred Stock), plus (ii) the total number of such Additional Shares of Common Stock
so issued, provided that such Conversion Price shall not be so reduced at such time if the
amount of such reduction would be an amount less than $0.01, but any such amount shall
be carried forward and any reduction with respect thereto shall be made at the time of and
together with any subsequent reduction which, together with such amount and any other
amount or amounts so carried forward, shall aggregate $0.01 or more.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this
Section 3.3(d), the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any
Additional Shares of Common Stock shall be computed as follows:

Q) Cash and Property, Such consideration shall:

; (A) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the aggregate
amount of cash received by the Corporation excluding amounts paid or payable for
accrued interest or accrued dividends;

(B) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith
by the Board of Directors; and

(C) in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock are issued
together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for
consideration which covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received,
computed as provided in clauses (A) and (B) above, as determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors.

(2) Options and Convertible Securities, The aggregate
consideration received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock
deemed to have been issued pursuant to Section 3.3(d)(iii)(1), relating to Options and
Convertible Securities, shall be determined by computing the total amount, if any,
received or receivable by the Corporation as consideration for the issue of such Options
or Convertible Securities, plus the minimuni aggregate amount of additional
consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any
provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration until such
subsequent adjustment occurs) payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such
Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities or in the case of
Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options for Convertible
Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities. The total
number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued shall be determined by
calculating the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set forth in the
instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a
subsequent adjustment of such number until such subsequent adjustment occurs) issuable

B3499024.2 -9-
upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities.

(vi) Adjustment for Dividends, Distributions, Subdivisions
Combinations or Consolidation of Common Stock.

() Stock Dividends, Distributions or Subdivisions. In the
event the Corporation at any time, or from time to time, shall declare or pay any dividend
or make any other distribution on the Common Stock payable in Common Stock, or
effect a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or
otherwise than by payment of a dividend in Common Stock), the Conversion Price of
each series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such stock dividend, stock
distribution or subdivision shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such stock
dividend, stock distribution or subdivision, be proportionately decreased.

(2) Combinations or Consolidations. In the event the
outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined or consolidated, by
reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, the
Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such
combination or consolidation shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such
combination or consolidation, be proportionately increased.

(vii) Adjustment for Merger or Reorganization. Subject to the
provisions of Section 3.2(d), in case of any consolidation or merger of the Corporation

with or into another corporation or the conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets
of the Corporation to another corporation in which the holders of Common Stock will be
entitled to receive shares of stock, other securities or property, each share of each series
of Preferred Stock shall thereafter be convertible into the number of shares of stock or
other securities or property to which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock
of the Corporation deliverable upon conversion of such share of Preferred Stock would
have been entitled upon such consolidation, merger or conveyance. In any such case,
appropriate adjustment (as determined by the Board of Directors) shall be made in the
application of these provisions set forth with respect to the rights and interest thereafter of
the holders of Preferred Stock, to the end that these provisions (including provisions with
respect.to.changes in and other adjustments of the Conversion Prices) shall thereafter be
applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any shares of stock or other
property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of Preferred Stock.

(e) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each
adjustment or readjustment of any Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 3.3, the
Corporation at its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in
accordance with these terms and furnish to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate
setting forth such adjustment, readjustment or conversion and showing in detail the facts
upon which such adjustment, readjustment or conversion is based, provided that the
failure to promptly provide such notice shall not affect the effectiveness of such
adjustment, readjustment or conversion, The Corporation shall, upon the written request
at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such

B3499024.2 -10-
holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and readjustments, (ii) each
Conversion Price at the time in effect, and (iii) the number of shares of Common Stock
and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon the
conversion of a share of each series of Preferred Stock.

(f) Notices of Record Date. In the event of (i) any taking by the
Corporation of a record date of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of
determining the holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a
cash dividend which is the same as cash dividends paid in previous quarters) or other
distribution, or (ii) any capital reorganization of the Corporation, any reclassification or
recapitalization of the capital stock of the Corporation, any merger or consolidation of the
Corporation, and any transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation to
any other corporation, or any other entity or person, or any voluntary or involuntary
dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Corporation, the Corporation shall mail to
each holder of Preferred Stock at least 30 days prior to the record date specified therein, a
notice specifying (A) the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of
such dividend or distribution and a description of such dividend or distribution, (B) the
date on which any such reorganization, reclassification, transfer, consolidation, merger,
dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to become effective, and (C) the time,
if any, that is to be fixed, as to when the holders of record of Common Stock (or other
securities) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock (or other
securities) for securities or other property deliverable upon such reorganization,
reclassification, transfer, consolidation, merger, dissolution, liquidation or winding up.

’ (g) | Common Stock Reserved. The Corporation shall reserve and keep
available out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock such number of shares of
Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect conversion of the
Preferred Stock.

3.4. Redemption.

(a) On July 22, 2013 and on each of the first and second anniversaries
thereof (each such date being referred to hereinafter as a “Redemption Date”), upon the
demand of the holders of at least two-thirds in voting power of the then outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall redeem from each such holder of shares
of Preferred Stock, at the applicable Redemption Price (as defined below), the following
respective portions of the number of shares of each series of Preferred Stock held by such

holder on the applicable Redemption Date:
Redemption Date Portion of Shares of each Series of
Preferred Stock to be Redeemed
July 22, 2013 33 1/3%

July 22, 2014 66 2/3%

B3499024.2 -1l-
July 22, 2015 100%

For the purposes of this Section 3.4, the term “Redemption Price” means a price per share
equal to, (i) in the case of the Series A Preferred, the sum of (x) $1.68 (subject to
appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or
other similar recapitalization affecting such shares) plus (y) any dividends declared but
unpaid thereon, (ii) in the case of the Series A-1 Preferred, the sum of (x) $1.848 (subject
to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or
other similar recapitalization affecting such shares) plus (y) any dividends declared but
unpaid thereon, and (iii) in the case of each of the Series A-2 Preferred and Series A-3

(b) If the funds of the Corporation legally available for redemption of
the Preferred Stock on any Redemption Date are insufficient to redeem the number of
shares of Preferred Stock required under this Section 3 to be redeemed on such date,
those funds which are legally available will be used to redeem the maximum possible
number of such shares ratably on the basis of the number of shares of each series of
Preferred Stock which would be redeemed on such date if the funds of the Corporation
legally available therefor had been sufficient to redeem all the shares of Preferred Stock
required to be redeemed on such date. At any time thereafter when additional funds of
the Corporation become legally available for the redemption of the Preferred Stock, such
funds will be used, at the end of the next succeeding fiscal quarter, to redeem the balance
of the shares which the Corporation was theretofore obligated to redeem, ratably on the
basis set forth in the preceding sentence.

redemption price, no share of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to any dividends declared
after its applicable redemption date, and on such redemption date all rights of the holder
of such shares as a stockholder of the Corporation by reason of the ownership of such
share will cease, except the right to receive the applicable Redemption Price of such
share, upon presentation and surrender of the certificate representing such share and such
share will not from and after such redemption date be deemed to be outstanding.

number of whole shares of Common Stock into which the shares of such series of
Preferred Stock held by such holder are convertible as of the record date for determining
stockholders entitled to vote on such matter. Except as provided by law or by the

B3499024.2 -12-
