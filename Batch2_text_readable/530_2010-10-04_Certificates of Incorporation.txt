Series B Stock and Series C Stock, out of funds legally available for that purpose, dividends at
the rate of 8% of the applicable Original Purchase Price (as defined below) per share per annum
compounding annually and which will accrue on a quarterly basis commencing on the Original
_ Issuance Date (as defined in Section A.8 hereof) applicable to each share of Series B Stock and

Stock.

(b) In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the affairs of
the Corporation (collectively, a “Liquidation”), (i) the holders of shares of Series B Stock and
Series C Stock then outstanding (the “Senior Stockholders”) shall be entitled to receive out of the
assets of the Corporation legally available for distribution to its stockholders, whether from
capital, surplus or earnings, before any payment shall be made to the holders of Series A Stock
then outstanding (the “Series A Stockholders” together with the Senior Stockholders, the
“Preferred Stockholders”), the holders of Common Stock or any other class or series of stock
ranking on Liquidation junior to such Series B Stock and Series C Stock, an amount per share
equal to the Original Purchase Price (as defined in Section A.8 hereof) applicable thereto, plus,
in each case, an amount equal to any accrued but unpaid dividends thereon pursuant to Section
A.3(b) hereof; and (ii) after the distribution to the Senior Stockholders of the full amount to
which they are entitled to receive pursuant to this Section A.4(b), the Series A Stockholders shall
be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Corporation legally available for distribution to its
stockholders, whether from capital, surplus or earnings, before any payment shall be made to the
holders of Common Stock or any other class or series of stock ranking on Liquidation junior to

to them in respect of the shares of Series B Stock and Series C Stock held upon such distribution
if all amounts payable on or with respect to such shares were paid in full.

(d) __If, upon any Liquidation, the assets of the Corporation available for
distribution to its stockholders shall be insufficient to pay the Series A Stockholders the full
amount as to which each of them shall be entitled, then after payment of the full amount to the

of assets according to the respective amounts which would be payable to them in respect of the

shares of Series A Stock held upon such distribution if all amounts payable on or with respect to
such shares were paid in full.

pursuant to Section A.4(e)(v) or otherwise prevented by law) redeem all of the shares of
Series A Stock, Series B Stock and Series C Stock then outstanding for a cash amount per
share determined as set forth herein (the “Special Liquidation Price,” said redemption
being referred to herein as a “Special Liquidation”). In the event the Event of Sale
involves consideration that does not consist of cash, then the Special Liquidation Price
may be paid with such consideration having a value equal to the Special Liquidation
Price. To the extent there is any cash consideration in connection with an Event of Sale,
the cash consideration will first be applied to satisfy the Special Liquidation Price prior to
the payment thereof to any stockholders of the Corporation. For all purposes of this
Section A.4(e), the Special Liquidation Price shall be equal to that amount per share
which would be received by each Senior Stockholder and each Series A Stockholder if, in
connection with an Event of Sale, all the consideration paid in exchange for the assets or
the shares of capital stock (as the case may be) of the Corporation were actually paid to
and received by the Corporation and the Corporation were immediately thereafter
liquidated and its assets distributed pursuant to Sections A.4(a) through (d) hereof. To
the extent that one or more redemptions (as described in Section A.5 hereof) and/or
Special Liquidations are occurring concurrently, the Special Liquidation under this
Section A.4(e) shall be deemed to occur first. The date upon which the Special
Liquidation shall occur is sometimes referred to herein as the “Special Liquidation Date”.

(ii) At any time on or after the Special Liquidation Date, a Preferred
Stockholder shall be entitled to receive the Special Liquidation Price for each such share
of Preferred Stock owned by such holder. Subject to the provisions of Section A.4(e)(iii)
hereof, payment of the Special Liquidation Price will be made upon actual delivery to the
Corporation or its transfer agent of the certificate representing such shares of Preferred
Stock, or an affidavit of loss as to the same.

(iii) If on the Special Liquidation Date less than all of the shares of the
Series A Stock, Series B Stock or Series C Stock then outstanding may be legally
redeemed by the Corporation, the Special Liquidation shall be made first as to the Series

B Stock and Series C Stock, pro rata according to the respective amounts which would be
payable to them in respect of the shares of Series B Stock and Series C Stock held upon
such distribution if all amounts payable on or with respect to such shares were paid in
full, until such holders are satisfied in full and then to the holders of the Series A Stock
pro rata with respect to such Series A Stock based upon the number of outstanding shares
of Series A Stock then owned by each holder thereof.

(iv) Onand after any Special Liquidation Date, all rights in respect of
the shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall cease and terminate except the right to
receive the applicable Special Liquidation Price as provided herein, and such shares of
Preferred Stock shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding, whether or not the
certificates representing such shares of Preferred Stock have been received by the
Corporation; provided, however, that, if the Corporation defaults in the payment of the
Special Liquidation Price with respect to any shares of Preferred Stock, the rights of the
holder(s) thereof with respect to such shares of Preferred Stock shall continue until the
Corporation cures such default.

(v) | Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the
provisions of this Section A.4(e) may be waived by the holders of a majority of the
voting power of the shares of Series B Stock and Series C Stock then outstanding, voting
together as a single class, by delivery of written notice of waiver to the Corporation prior
to the closing of any Event of Sale, in which event the Corporation shall not redeem any
shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section A.4(f).

(vi) Any notice required to be given to the holders of shares of
Preferred Stock pursuant to Section A.7(g) hereof in connection with an Event of Sale
shall include a statement by the Corporation of (A) the Special Liquidation Price which
each Preferred Stockholder shall be entitled to receive upon the occurrence of a Special
Liquidation under this Section A.4(d) and (B) the extent to which the Corporation will, if
at all, be legally prohibited from paying each holder of Preferred Stock the Special
Liquidation Price.

(vii) For purposes of this Section A.4(f), an “Event of Sale” shall mean
(A) the merger or consolidation of the Corporation into or with another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other entity, or the merger or consolidation of any
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other entity (collectively, an “Entity”) into
or with the Corporation (in which consolidation or merger the stockholders of the
Corporation receive distributions of cash or securities as a result of such consolidation or
merger in complete exchange for their shares of capital stock of the Corporation), or (B)
the sale or other disposition in one transaction or a series of related transactions of all or
substantially all the assets of the Corporation, unless, (i) upon consummation of such

(a) _—_ At the request of the holder or holders of not less than 66 2/3% of the

a single class (individually, a “Requesting Holder” and, collectively, the “Requesting Holders”)
made at any time after the fifth (5") anniversary of the Series B Applicable Issuance Date, the
Corporation shall redeem on the Redemption Date (as such term is defined in Section A.5(c)
hereof), unless otherwise legally prohibited, at a redemption price per share equal to the Original
Purchase Price of the Series B Stock and Series C Stock, as applicable, plus an amount equal to
any accrued but unpaid dividends thereon, up to twenty-five percent (25%) of the Series B Stock
and Series C Stock owned of record by the Requesting Holders at the time that such request is
made, and in each subsequent year thereafter (upon the anniversary of the Redemption Date) up
to twenty-five percent (25%) of the shares of Series B Stock and Series C Stock that were owned
of record by the Requesting Holders on the Redemption Date plus up to that number of shares of
Series B Stock and Series C Stock that the Requesting Holders could have required the
Corporation to have redeemed in the year or years following the Redemption Date pursuant to
this Section A.5(a), but elected not to have redeemed. Each Requesting Holder who desires to
have any of the Series B Stock or Series C Stock owned of record by such Requesting Holder
redeemed shall specify in a written notice to the Corporation the number of shares which the
Requesting Holder elects to redeem (a “Redemption Notice”), in accordance with Section A.5(c)
hereof. The total sum payable per share of Series B Stock and Series C Stock on the Redemption
Date or on the subsequent anniversaries of the Redemption Date, as the case may be, is
hereinafter referred to as the “Redemption Price,” and the payment to be made on the
Redemption Date is hereinafter referred to as the “Redemption Payment.”

(b) On and after each Redemption Date, all rights of each Requesting Holder
with respect to those shares of Series B Stock and Series C Stock being redeemed by the
Corporation pursuant to Section A.5(a) on such Redemption Date, except the right to receive the
Redemption Price per share of such Series B Stock and Series C Stock being redeemed as
hereinafter provided, shall cease and terminate, and such shares of Series B Stock and Series C
Stock shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding, whether or not the certificates representing
such shares have been received by the Corporation; provided, however, that, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth herein, (A) if the Corporation defaults in the payment of the
Redemption Payment with respect to any shares of Series B Stock and Series C Stock subject to
redemption, the rights of the Requesting Holder with respect to such shares of Series B Stock
and Series C Stock shall continue until the Corporation cures such default, and (B) without
limiting any other rights of a Requesting Holder, upon the occurrence of a subsequent
Liquidation or Event of Sale, with respect to the shares of Series B Stock and Series C Stock in
respect of which no Redemption Payment has been received by a Requesting Holder, such
Requesting Holder shall be accorded the rights and benefits set forth in Section A.4 hereof in
respect of such remaining shares, as if no prior redemption request had been made.

(c) Each Requesting Holder shall send its Redemption Notice pursuant to this
Section A.5 by first-class, certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, to the

A/73466838.6/3000341-0000344518 6
Corporation at its principal place of business or to any transfer agent of the Corporation. Within
five (5) Business Days after receipt of a Redemption Notice, the Corporation shall notify in
writing all other Senior Stockholders of the request by a Requesting Holder for the redemption of
Series B Stock and Series C Stock (the “Corporation Notice”). If any other Senior Stockholder
desires to have redeemed all or any portion of the Series B Stock and Series C Stock owned of
record by such Senior Stockholder, each such Senior Stockholder shall send a Redemption
Notice to the Corporation postmarked within five (5) Business Days after the receipt of the
Corporation Notice, and such Senior Stockholder shall be deemed to be a Requesting Holder.

On the twentieth (20th) Business Day following the date upon which the Corporation received
the first Redemption Notice from a Requesting Holder, the Corporation shall pay each
Requesting Holder the applicable Redemption Price pursuant to the terms of Section A.5(a),
provided that the Corporation or its transfer agent has received the certificate(s) representing the
shares of Series B Stock and Series C Stock to be redeemed. Such payment date shall be
referred to herein as the “Redemption Date”. Thereafter, if any Senior Stockholder that was not
previously a Requesting Holder desires to have redeemed all or any portion of the Series B Stock
and Series C Stock owned of record by such Senior Stockholder, or any Requesting Holder
desires to have redeemed additional shares of Series B Stock and Series C Stock that were not
covered by a previous Redemption Notice, each such Senior Stockholder shall send a
Redemption Notice to the Corporation postmarked at least twenty (20) Business Days prior to
any anniversary of the Redemption Date, and such Senior Stockholder shall thereafter be deemed
to be a Requesting Holder. On each anniversary of the Redemption Date following such timely
notice, the Corporation shall pay each such Requesting Holder, together with each original
Requesting Holder whose requested shares have not yet been fully redeemed, the applicable
Redemption Price for the shares of Series B Stock and Series C Stock requested to be redeemed,
subject to the twenty-five percent (25%) limitation set forth in Section A.5(a) hereof and
pursuant to any other applicable terms set forth in Sections A.5(a) and A.5(c) hereof. If, on the
Redemption Date, less than all the shares of Series B Stock and Series C Stock requested to be
redeemed may be legally redeemed by the Corporation, the redemption of such Series B Stock
and Series C Stock shall be pro rata based upon the number of shares of Series B Stock and
Series C Stock requested to be redeemed by each Requesting Holder thereof, subject to the
twenty-five percent (25%) limitation set forth in Section A.5(a) hereof, if applicable, and any
shares of Series B Stock and Series C Stock not redeemed shall be redeemed, at the holder’s
election, on any date following such Redemption Date on which the Corporation may lawfully
redeem such shares, again subject to such twenty-five percent (25%) limitation, if applicable.
The Corporation shall redeem (unless otherwise legally prohibited) the shares of Series B Stock
and Series C Stock being redeemed by each Requesting Holder on the Redemption Date and the
Corporation shall promptly advise each Requesting Holder of such Redemption Date or of the
relevant facts applicable thereto preventing such redemption. Upon redemption of only a portion
of the number of shares covered by a Series B Stock certificate or Series C Stock certificate, the
Corporation shall issue and deliver to or upon the written order of the holder of such Series B
Stock certificate or Series C Stock certificate, at the expense of the Corporation, a new certificate
covering the number of shares of Series B Stock or Series C Stock, as applicable, representing
the unredeemed portion of such Series B Stock certificate or Series C Stock certificate, which
new certificate shall entitle the holder thereof to all the rights, powers and privileges of a holder
of such shares.

AS73466838.6/300034 0000344518 7
