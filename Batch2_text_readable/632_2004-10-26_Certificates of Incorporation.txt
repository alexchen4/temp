Section 2115(b) of the CGCL, every stockholder entitled to vote at an election for
directors may cumulate the votes of such stockholder and give one candidate a
number of votes equal to the number of directors to be elected multiplied by the
number of votes to which the shares of such stockholder are otherwise entitled, or

removal; provided, however, that unless the entire Board of Directors is removed, no
individual director may be removed when the votes cast against the removal of such
director, or not consenting in writing to such removal, would be sufficient to elect
that director if voted cumulatively at an election which the same total number of
votes were cast (or, if such action is taken by written consent, all shares entitled to
vote were voted) and the entire number of directors authorized at the time of such
director’s most recent election were then being elected.

to Section 2115(b) of the CGCL and subject to any limitations imposed by law, this
