115588095 v8

A0769320

be entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, such holder
shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Company
or of any transfer agent for such shares, and shall give written notice by mail, postage prepaid, to
the Company at its principal corporate office, of the election to convert the same and shall state
therein the name or names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock are
to be issued (a Preferred Holder may not effect a transfer of shares pursuant to a conversion
unless all applicable restrictions on transfer are complied with.) The Company shall, as soon as
practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of shares of Preferred Stock,

49291488_8
115588095 v8

40769320

or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of
shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as provided
above. The Company shall promptly pay (i) in cash or, to the extent sufficient funds are not then
legally available therefor, in Common Stock (at the Common Stock’s fair market value
determined in good faith by the Board as of the date of such conversion), any declared and
unpaid dividends on the shares of Preferred Stock being converted and (ii) in cash (at the
Common Stock’s fair market value determined in good faith by the Board as of the date of
conversion) the value of any fractional share of Common Stock otherwise issuable to any holder
of Preferred Stock. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to
the close of business on the date of such surrender of the certificate or certificates representing
the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the
record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock as of such date.

3.3 Conversion Price Adjustments. The Conversion Price of the Series 2 Preferred,
the Series 3 Preferred, the Series 4 Preferred, the Series 5 Preferred, Series 6 Preferred, Series 6-
A Preferred, Series 7 Preferred and Series Z Preferred shall be subject to adjustment from time to
time as follows:

(i) (A) _ If the Company shall issue at any time after the Effective Date (as
defined below) any Additional Stock (as defined below) without consideration or for a
consideration per share less than the applicable Conversion Price of the Series Z Preferred,
Series 7 Preferred, Series 6 Preferred, the Series 6-A Preferred, the Series 6-B Preferred, the
Series 5 Preferred, Series 4 Preferred, the Series 3 Preferred or Series 2 Preferred (together, the
“Senior Preferred’), as applicable in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional
Stock, then the applicable Conversion Price of the applicable series of Senior Preferred in effect
immediately prior to each such issuance shall (except as otherwise provided in this clause (i)) be
adjusted to an amount determined by dividing (X) an amount equal to the sum of (a) the product
derived by multiplying the applicable Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such
issuance times the number of shares of Common Stock (including shares of Common Stock
deemed to have been issued upon conversion of the outstanding Preferred Stock or otherwise
under Section 3,3(i)(E), with the Series 6-A Preferred treated as being convertible into Common
Stock (without actual conversion) for this purpose) outstanding immediately prior to such
issuance, plus (b) the consideration, if any, received by or. deemed to have been received by the
Company upon such issuance, by (Y) an amount equal to the sum of (a) the number of shares of
Common Stock (including shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued upon
conversion of the outstanding Preferred Stock or otherwise issuable upon the exercise or
conversion of all other outstanding rights, options and convertible securities, with the Series 6-A
Preferred treated as being convertible into Common Stock (without actual conversion) for this
purpose) outstanding immediately prior to such issuance, plus (b) the number of shares of
Common Stock issued or deemed to have been issued in such issuance.

(B) No adjustment of the applicable Conversion Price of the Senior
Preferred shall be made in an amount less than one cent per share, provided that any adjustment
that is not required to be made by reason of this sentence shall be carried forward and taken into
account in any subsequent adjustment. Except to the limited extent provided for in Sections
3.3(i)(E)(3), 3.30)(E)(4) and 3.3(iv), no adjustment of the applicable Conversion Price of the

492914888
115588095 v8

A0769320'

Senior Preferred shall have the effect of increasing the applicable Conversion Price of the Senior
Preferred above the applicable Conversion Price of the Senior Preferred in effect immediately
prior to such adjustment.

(C) In the case of the issuance of Common Stock for cash, the
consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting any
discounts, commissions or other expenses paid or incurred by the Company to any underwriter in
connection with the issuance and sale of such Common Stock.

(D) _ In the case of the issuance of Common Stock for a consideration in
whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be deemed to be the fair
value thereof as determined by the Board,

(E) In the case of the issuance of options to purchase or rights to
subscribe for Common Stock, securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for
Common Stock or options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or
exchangeable securities (where the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such
options or rights or upon conversion or exchange of such securities are not excluded from the
definition of Additional Stock), the following provisions shall apply:

(1) the aggregate maximum number of shares of Common
Stock deliverable upon exercise of such options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common
Stock shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such options or rights were issued and for
a consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in Sections
3.3(/)(C) and 3,3(i)(D)), if any, received by the Company upon the issuance of such options or
rights plus the minimum purchase price provided in such options or rights for the Common Stock
covered thereby;

(2) the aggregate maximum number of shares of Common
Stock deliverable upon conversion of or in exchange for any such convertible or exchangeable
securities or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible
or exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof shall be deemed to
have been issued at the time such securities were issued or such options or rights were issued and
for a consideration equal to the consideration, if any, received by the Company for any such
securities and related options or rights (excluding any cash received on account of accrued
interest or accrued dividends), plus the additional consideration, if any, to be received by the
Company upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or the exercise of any related
options or rights (the consideration in each case to be determined in the manner provided in
Sections 3.3(i)(C) and 3.3(i)(D));

(3) In the event of any change in the number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable upon exercise of such options or rights or upon conversion of or in
exchange for such convertible or exchangeable securities, including, but not limited to, a change
resulting from the antidilution provisions thereof, the applicable Conversion Price of the Senior
Preferred in effect at the time shall forthwith be readjusted to the applicable Conversion Price of
the Senior Preferred as would have obtained had the adjustment that was made upon the issuance
of such options, rights or securities not converted prior to such change or the options or rights

(4) Upon the expiration of any such options or rights, the
termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options or rights
related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the applicable Conversion Price of the.
Senior Preferred shall forthwith be readjusted to the applicable Conversion Price of the Senior

subtracting the amount of the dividend per share of Common Stock from such Series Z
Conversion Price, such amount to be the amount of cash and any other form of consideration to
be valued in accordance with the provisions of Section 8(f) of the Notes.

Series Z Conversion Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such
record date and thereafter the Series Z Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this
