such office that the holder elects to convert the same. Such notice shall also state whether the
holder elects to receive in cash any declared but unpaid dividends on the Series Preferred

certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as
aforesaid, (2) a check payable to such holder in the amount of any cash amounts payable as a
result of the conversion of any shares of Series Preferred into fractional shares of Common
Stock, and, if such holder elects not to convert unpaid dividends into Common Stock, all
declared and unpaid dividends on such holder’s converted Series Preferred and, (3) if Jess than
all of the shares of the Preferred Stock represented by such certificate are converted into
Common Stock, a certificate representing the shares of Series Preferred not converted into-
Common Stock. In the event of any conversion at the election of a holder of Series Preferred,
such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business
on the date of such surrender of the shares of Series Preferred to be converted, and the person or
persons entitled to receive the shares of-Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be

date.

conversion shall be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriter of the sale of securities
pursuant to such offering, in which event the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion of the Series Preferred shall not be deemed to have converted such
Series Preferred until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities. Notice of such
conversion shall be given by the Corporation by mail, postage pre-paid, to the holders of the
Series Preferred at their addresses shown in the Corporation’s records, within a reasonable time

any transfer agent for the applicable series of Series Preferred. Upon surrendering such shares
each holder of Series Preferred shal! deliver a notice to the Corporation that shall state whether
the holder elects to receive in cash any declared but unpaid dividends on the Preferred Stock to

number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid, and (2) a
check payable to the holder in the amount of any cash amounts payable as a result of the
conversion of any shares of Series Preferred into fractional shares of Common Stock, and, if such
holder elects not to convert unpaid dividends into Common Stock, all declared and unpaid
dividends on such holder’s converted Series Preferred. Notwithstanding that any certificate
representing the Series Preferred to be converted shall not have been surrendered, each holder of
such Series Preferred shall thereafter be treated for all purposes as the record holder of the
number of shares of Common Stock issuable to such holder upon such conversion, assuming that
such holder had elected to convert alt declared or accrued but unpaid dividends on its Series
Preferred into Common Stock.

Series Preferred shall be subject to adjustment as follows:

is issued (the “Original Issue Date’), the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be
subdivided or increased (by stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or otherwise) into a
greater number of shares of Common Stock, and no equivalent subdivision or increase is made
with respect to the Series Preferred, the respective Conversion Price then in effect for each series.

shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination or consolidation, be
proportionately. increased. :

(ii) Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. In the
event that on or after the Original Issue Date, the Corporation pays a dividend or other
distribution in securities of the Corporation to holders of Common Stock, and no equivalent
dividend or other distribution is made to the holders of Series Preferred, then and in each such
event provision shall be made so that the holders of each series of Series Preferred shall receive,
concurrently therewith, the amount of such securities which they would have received had their
Series Preferred been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event. If the Company
fixes a record date to determine which holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive such
dividend or other distribution, the Conversion Prices with respect to the Series Preferred shail be
fixed as of the close of business on such record date and the number of shares of Common Stock
shall be calculated immediately prior to the close of business on such record date.

(iii) Adjustments for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution.

In the event that on or after the Original Issue Date, the Common Stock issuable upon conversion

of the Series Preferred shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of any

Additional Shares of Common issued as of the time of such issue, or in the case such a record
date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date; provided that
Additional Shares of Common shall not be deemed to have been issued unless the consideration
per share (determined pursuant to Section 4(e)(v) hereof) of such Additional Shares of Common
would be less than the applicable Conversion Price of the Senior Preferred in effect on the date of
and immediately prior to such issue, or such record date, as the case may be; and provided
further that in any such case in which Additional Shares of Common are deemed to be issued:

(A) — except as provided in clause (B) below, no further
adjustment in the Conversion Price of the Senior Preferred shall be made upon the subsequent
issue of Convertible Securities or shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of such Options or
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities; © -

(B) if such Options or Convertible Securities by their

CADocuments
263319 v3/CO
terms provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any increase in the consideration
payable to the Corporation, or decrease in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable, upon
the exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, the Conversion Price computed upon the original
issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent
adjustments based thereon, shall, upon any such increase or decrease becoming effective, be
recomputed to reflect such increase or decrease insofar as it affects such Options or the rights of
conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities;

(C) upon the expiration of any such Options or any
rights of conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have been
exercised, the Conversion Price computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence
of a record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon
such expiration, be recomputed as if:

(a) in the case of Convertible Securities or
Options for Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common issued were shares of
Common Stock, if any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities and the consideration received therefor was the
consideration actually received by the Corporation for the issue of all such Options, whether or
not exercised, plus the consideration actually received by the Corporation upon such exercise, or
for the issue of all such Convertible Securities which were actually converted or exchanged, plus
the additional consideration, if any, actually received by the Corporation upon such conversion or
exchange; and

(b) in the case of Options for Convertible
Securities, only the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were
issued at the time of issue of such Options, and the consideration received by the Corporation for
the Additional Shares of Common deemed to have been then issued was the consideration
actually received by the Corporation for the issuance of all such Options, whether or not
exercised, plus the consideration deemed to have been received by the Corporation upon the
issue of the Convertible Securities with respect to which such Options were actually exercised;

(D) no readjustment pursuant to clause (B) or (C) above
shall have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price to an amount which exceeds the lower of
(i) the Conversion Price on the original adjustment date or (ii) the Conversion Price that would
have resulted from any issuance of Additional Shares of Common between the original
adjustment date and such readjustment date; and

_ {E) in the case of any Options which expire by their
terms not more than 30 days after the date of issue thereof, no adjustment of the Conversion
Price shall be made until the expiration or exercise of all such Options, whereupon such
adjustments shall be made in the same manner provided in clause (C) above.

Issuance of Additional Shares of Common. In the event the Corporation shall issue Additional

Shares of Common after the Original Issue Date (including Additional Shares of Common

C:\Documents
263319 v3/CO
deemed to be issued pursuant to Section 4(e)(iii)) without consideration or for a consideration per
share less than the applicable Conversion Price of the Senior Preferred then in effect immediately
prior to such issue, then and in such event, the applicable Conversion Price of the Senior
Preferred shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest cent)
determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be
the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue, plus the
number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration received by. the
Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of Common so issued would purchase at
such Conversion Price, and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue, plus the number of such Additional Shares of
Common so issued; provided that for the purposes of such reduction all shares of Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of all outstanding Options and upon conversion of outstanding
Convertible Securities shall be deemed to be outstanding, and immediately after any Additional
Shares of Common are deemed issued pursuant to Section 4(e)(iii), such Additional Shares of
Common shall be deemed to be outstanding.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this Section
4(e), the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional Shares of
Common shall be computed as follows:

(1) Cash and Property: Such consideration shall:

{A) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at thet net
amount of cash received by the Corporation excluding expenses, discounts and commissions
payable by the Corporation in connection with such issuance or sale and amounts paid or payable
for accrued interest; a

(B) _ insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith by the
Board net of expenses as set forth in clause (A) above; and

(C) in the event Additional Shares of Common. are
issued together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for consideration
which covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in
clauses (A) and (B) above, as determined in good faith by the Board.

(2) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration
per share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common deemed to have been
issued pursuant to Section 4(e)(iii), relating to Options and Convertible Securities, shall be
determined by dividing:

the Corporation as consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the
minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating”
thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such
consideration) payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or

number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding shares of Series Preferred, and if at any time the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all then outstanding shares of the Series Preferred, in addition to such other remedies as shall
be available to the holder of such Series Preferred, the Corporation will take such corporate
action as may, in the option of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes,
