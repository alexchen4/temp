Company shall have authority to issue is 77,170,221, 50,000,000 shares of which shall be
Common Stock with the par value of $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”), and 27,170,221
shares of which shall be Preferred Stock with the par value of $0.0001 per share. The Preferred.
Stock may be issued in one or more series. Of the Preferred Stock, 500,000 shares shall be
designated Series A-1 Preferred Stock (the “Series A-1 Preferred”), 4,670,221 shares shall be
designated Series A-2 Preferred Stock (the “Series A-2 Preferred”) and 22,000,000 shares shall
be designated Series B Preferred Stock (the “Series B Preferred” and together with the Series A-
1 Preferred and the Series A-2 Preferred, the “Preferred Stock’).

B. The terms and provisions of the Preferred Stock and Common Stock are as
follows:
1. Dividends.

(a) Treatment of Series B Preferred. The holders of Series B Preferred shail
be entitled to receive a preferential cumulative dividend, when, as and if declared by the Board

-2-
$V\536128.5
of Directors, but only out of funds that are legally available therefor, at the rate of $0.0272 per
annum on each outstanding share of Series B Preferred (as adjusted for stock splits,
combinations, reorganizations and the like with respect to the Series B Preferred), prior and in
preference to any declaration or payment of any dividend on the Series A-1 Preferred, Series A-2
Preferred or the Common Stock, provided, however, that the total value of dividends paid on the
shares of Series B Preferred after the Original Issue Date (as hereinafter defined) shall not
exceed $1,000,000 in the aggregate. Subject to the foregoing limitation, such dividends shall be
deemed to accrue on each share of the Series B Preferred commencing on its issuance date,
whether or not earned or declared and whether or not there are profits, surplus or other funds of
the Company legally available for the payment of dividends but shall be payable only when such
dividends are declared by the Board of Directors or as set forth in this Section 1 or upon a
Liquidation (as hereinafter defined) as provided in Section 2 hereof or a redemption as provided
in Section 7 hereof. Dividends shall be cumulative but not compound. If such dividends in
respect of any prior or current dividend period shall not have been declared and paid or if there
shall not have been a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for later payment, the
deficiency shall first be fully paid before any dividend or other distribution shall be paid or
declared and set apart with respect to any class of the Company’s capital stock, now or hereafter
outstanding.

(b) ‘Treatment of Series A-1 Preferred and Series A-2 Preferred: After
payment of the cumulative cash dividends required by Section 1(a) (whether or not declared), the
holders of the Series A-1 Preferred and Series A-2 Preferred, in preference to the holders of any
other stock of the Company other than the Series B Preferred, shall be entitled to receive, when
and as declared by the Board of Directors, but only out of funds that are legally available
therefor, non-cumulative cash dividends at the rate of $0.0150 and $0.0209, respectively, per
annum on each outstanding share of Series A-1 Preferred and Series A-2 Preferred (as adjusted
for stock splits, combinations, reorganizations and the like with respect to the Series A-1
Preferred and Series A-2 Preferred, respectively).

(c) Treatment of Common Stock. After payment of the dividends provided by
Sections 1({a) and 1(b) (whether or not declared), any additional dividends declared shall be
distributed among all holders of Common Stock and Preferred Stock in proportion to the number
of shares of Common Stock held by each such holder (or with respect to a holder of Preferred
Stock the number of shares of Common Stock into which the holder’s Preferred Stock is
convertible). No dividends shall be declared or paid on the Common Stock unless and until the
holders of Preferred Stock shall have received all unpaid dividends to which they are entitled
under this Section 1 (whether or not declared).

(d) Other Distributions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, in the event the Company shall make or issue, or shall fix a record date for the
determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution
with respect to Common Stock payable in (i) securities of the Company other than shares of
Common Stock or (ii) assets, then, and in each such event, the holders of Series B Preferred shall
receive prior to and in preference of any such dividend or distribution on the Common Stock
securities and assets in amounts equivalent to the cash that would have been required to be
distributed pursuant to Section 1(a), then the holders of Series A-1 Preferred and Series A-2

-3-
$W\536128.5
Preferred shall receive prior to and in preference to any such dividend or distribution on the
Common Stock securities and assets in amounts equivalent to the cash that would have been
required to be distributed pursuant to Section 1(b) (whether or not declared), and then the holders
of Preferred Stock shall receive, at the same time distribution is made to the holders of Common
Stock, the number of securities or other assets which they would have received had their
Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock, immediately prior to the record date for
determining holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such distribution.

(e) Consent to Certain Repurchases. As authorized by Section 402.5(c) of the
General Corporation Law of California, Sections 502 and 503 of the General Corporation Law of
California, to the extent otherwise applicable, shall not apply with respect to Distributions (as
hereinafter defined) made by the Company in connection with the repurchase of shares of
Common Stock issued to or held by employees, consultants, officers or directors at a price not
greater than the amount paid by such person for such shares upon termination of their
employment or services pursuant to agreements providing for the right of said repurchase or
upon exercise of a right of first refusal, which agreements were authorized by the Board of
Directors. For purposes of this Section 1(e), “Distribution” means the transfer of cash, property
or securities without consideration, whether by way of dividend or otherwise, or the purchase of
shares of the Company (other than in connection with the repurchase of shares of Common Stock
issued to or held by employees, consultants, officers or directors at a price not greater than the
amount paid by such persons for such shares upon termination of their employment or services
pursuant to agreements providing for the right of said repurchase or upon exercise of a right of
first refusal approved by the Board of Directors) for cash or property.

2. Liguidation Rights.

(a) Liquidation Preference. In the event of any Liquidation (as hereinafter
defined), whether voluntary or involuntary, before any distribution or payment shall be made to
the holders of Common Stock, the holders of Series A-1 Preferred, Series A-2 Preferred and
Series B Preferred shall be entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Company, prior and in
preference to the holders of the Common Stock, an amount per share of Series A-1 Preferred,
Series A-2 Preferred or Series B Preferred equal to (i) $0.2500 plus all declared and unpaid
dividends on the Series A-1 Preferred (as adjusted for stock splits, combinations, reorganizations
and the like with respect to the Series A-1. Preferred) for each share of Series A-1 Preferred held
by them, (ii) $0.3480 plus all declared and unpaid dividends on the Series A-2 Preferred (as
adjusted for stock splits, combinations, reorganizations and the like with respect to the Series A-
2 Preferred) for each share of Series A-2 Preferred held by them and (iii) $0.4540 plus all unpaid
cumulative dividends (whether or not declared) (as adjusted for stock splits, combinations,
reorganizations and the like with respect to the Series B Preferred) for each share of Series B
Preferred held by them, provided, however, that the total value of dividends paid on the shares of
Series B Preferred after the Original Issue Date shall not exceed $1,000,000 in the aggregate. If,
upon any such Liquidation, the assets of the Company shall be insufficient to make payment in
full to all holders of Series A-1 Preferred, Series A-2 Preferred and Series B Preferred of the
liquidation preference set forth in this Section 2(a), then such assets shall be distributed among
the holders of Series A-1 Preferred, Series A-2 Preferred and Series B Preferred at the time
outstanding, ratably in proportion to the full amounts to which they would otherwise be entitled.

-4-
SV1536128.5
(b) Remaining Assets. After the payment to the holders of the Preferred _
Stock of the full preferential amount specified above, any remaining assets of the Conipany shall
be distributed pro rata among the holders of the Common Stock and the holders of the Preferred
Stock on a pari passu basis according to the number of shares of Common Stock held by such
holders, where each holder of shares of Preferred Stock shall be treated for this purpose as
holding the greatest whole number of shares of Common Stock then issuable upon conversion of
all shares of Preferred Stock held by such holder pursuant to Section 3.

(c) Liquidation. A “Liquidation” shall mean the liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Company and, if so approved by the holders of a majority of the Preferred
Stock then outstanding, voting together as a single separate class (on an as-converted to
Common Stock basis), also shall be deemed to include (i) any consolidation or merger of the
Company with or into any other corporation or other entity or person, or any other corporate
reorganization, provided that the applicable transaction shall not be deemed a Liquidation unless
the Company’s stockholders holding a majority of the voting power of the Company
immediately prior to such transaction do not hold a majority of the voting power of the surviving
or acquiring entity (or its parent) immediately following such transaction; (ii) any transaction or
series of related transactions to which the Company is a party in which in excess of fifty percent
(50%) of the Company’s voting power is transferred; and (iii) a sale, lease, exclusive license or .
other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; provided that a
Liquidation shall not include any transaction or series of related transactions principally for bona
fide equity financing purposes in which cash is received by the Company or any successor or
indebtedness of the Company is cancelled or converted or a combination thereof occurs.

(d) Determination of Value if Proceeds Other than Cash. In any Liquidation, |
if the proceeds received by the Company or its stockholders are other than cash, its value will be
deemed its fair market value. Any securities shall be valued as follows:

(i) Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar
restrictions on free marketability covered by (ii) below:

(A) _ If traded on a securities exchange, the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange or system over
the twenty (20) trading-day period ending three (3) trading days prior to the closing of the
Liquidation;

(B) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the
twenty (20) trading-day period ending three (3) trading days prior to the closing of the
Liquidation; and

(C) If there is no active public market, the value shall be the
fair market value thereof, as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company, including a
majority of the Preferred Directors.

(ii) The method of valuation of securities subject to investment letter
or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of a

-5-
$V\536128.5
stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount
from the market value determined as above in (i) (A), (B) or (C) to reflect the approximate fair
market value thereof, as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company, including a
majority of the Preferred Directors.

3. Conversion. The Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as follows:

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at
the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share at the office
of the Company or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock. Each share of Series A-1
Preferred, Series A-2 Preferred and Series B Preferred shall be convertible into that number of
fully-paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock that is equal to $0.2500, $0.3480 and
$0.4540, respectively (each as adjusted for stock splits, combinations, reorganizations and the
like with respect to such shares) divided by the applicable Conversion Price (as hereinafter
defined) for such series of Preferred Stock. The “Conversion Price” per share of Series A-1
Preferred, Series A-2 Preferred and Series B Preferred shall initially be $0.2500, $0.3480 and
$0.4540, respectively, subject to adjustment as provided herein.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically _
be converted into shares of Common Stock at the then effective Conversion Price for such series
of Preferred Stock immediately upon (i) the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class on an as-converted
basis), or (ii) the consummation of a firm commitment underwritten public offering with a
nationally recognized investment bank of shares of the Company’s Common Stock pursuant to
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), on Form S-1 (as defined in the
Securities Act) or any successor form resulting in the Company having a market capitalization
(as determined by multiplying the offering price per share to the public by the number of shares
of Common Stock outstanding immediately following the public offering) of at least
$50,000,000.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be
issued upon conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder
would otherwise be entitled, the Company shall pay the fair market value cash equivalent of such
fractional share as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. For such purpose, all
shares of Common Stock (including fractions thereof) issuable upon conversion of more than
one share of Preferred Stock by a holder thereof shall be aggregated, and any resulting fractional
share of Common Stock shall be paid in cash. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to convert the same into full shares of Common Stock, and to receive certificate(s)
therefor, it shall surrender the Preferred Stock certificate or certificates, duly endorsed, at the
office of the Company or of any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, and shall give written
notice to the Company at such office that such holder elects to convert such shares; provided,
however, that in the event of an automatic conversion pursuant to paragraph 3(b) above, the
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically without any further action
by the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates representing such shares are
surrendered to the Company or its transfer agent; and provided further, however, that the
Company shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon such automatic conversion unless either the certificates evidencing such shares of

-6-
SV\536128.5
Preferred Stock are delivered to the Company or its transfer agent as provided above, or the
holder notifies the Company or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or
destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Company to indemnify the Company
from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates.

In the event that there are any declared and unpaid dividends (or unpaid accrued
dividends whether or not declared, in the case of the Series B Preferred) on any Preferred Stock
converted pursuant to paragraph 3(a) or 3(b), the Company shall issue to the holder of the
Preferred Stock converted pursuant to paragraph 3(a) or 3(b) that number of fully-paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock that is equal to the amount of such dividends divided by
the per share fair market value of the Common Stock as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors.

The Company shall, as soon as practicable after delivery of the Preferred Stock
certificate(s), issue and deliver to such holder of Preferred Stock, a certificate or certificates for
the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled and a check
payable to the holder in the amount of any cash amounts payable as the result of a conversion
into fractional shares of Common Stock. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made
immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred
Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of
such shares of Common Stock on such date; provided, however, that if the conversion is in
connection with an underwritten offer of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act, the
conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering Preferred Stock for conversion, be
conditioned upon the closing of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering, in which event
the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of the
Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately
prior to the closing of the sale of such securities.

All shares of Preferred Stock which shall have been surrendered for conversion as herein
provided shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares,
including the rights, if any, to receive notices and to vote, shal] immediately cease and terminate,
except only the right of the holders thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange
therefor and to receive payment of any dividends declared but unpaid thereon. Any shares of
Preferred Stock so converted shall be retired and cancelled and shall not be reissued as shares of
such series, and the Company (without the need for stockholder action) may from time to time
take such appropriate action as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of
Preferred Stock accordingly.

Upon any such conversion, no adjustment to the applicable Conversion Price shall be
made for any declared but unpaid dividends (declared and unpaid accrued dividends, in the case
of the Series B Preferred) on any series of Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion or on the
Common Stock delivered upon conversion.

(d) Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of Common. If at any time
or from time to time on or after the date that the first share of Series B Preferred is issued (the
“Original Issue Date”), the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided (by stock

-7-
S$V\536128.5
split, stock dividend or otherwise), into a greater number of shares of Common Stock without a
corresponding subdivision of the Preferred Stock, the applicable Conversion Price in effect for
each series of Preferred Stock immediately prior to such subdivision shall, concurrently with the
effectiveness of such subdivision, be proportionately decreased. If at any time or from time to
time on or after the Original Issue Date, if the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be
combined (by reclassification or otherwise) into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock
without a corresponding combination of the Preferred Stock, the applicable Conversion Price in
effect for each series of Preferred Stock immediately prior to such combination shall,
concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination, be proportionately increased.

(e) Adjustments for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. If at any
time or from time to time on or after the Original Issue Date, the Common Stock issuable upon

conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares
of any other class or classes of securities, whether by capital reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification or other event (other than a subdivision or combination of shares pursuant to
Section 3(d) above), concurrently with the effectiveness of such capital reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification or other event, each series of Preferred Stock shall be
convertible into, in lieu of the number of shares of Common Stock which the-holders would
otherwise have been entitled to receive, a number of shares of such other class or classes of
securities equivalent to the number of such shares or securities that would have been received by
the holder of a number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such series of
Preferred Stock immediately prior to such capital reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification
or other event. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the
provisions of this Section 3 with respect to the rights of the holders of Preferred Stock after the
capital reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other event to the end that the
provisions of this Section 3 (including adjustment of the applicable Conversion Price then in
effect for each series of Preferred Stock and the number and type of shares or other securities
issuable upon conversion of each series of Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event
and be as nearly equivalent as practicable.

(f) Adjustment for Common Stock Dividends and Distributions. If at any
time or from time to time on or after the Original Issue Date, the Company shall make or issue,
or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a
dividend or other distribution payable on the Common Stock in additional shares of Common
Stock, then and in each such event the applicable Conversion Price for each series of Preferred
Stock in effect immediately before such event shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance
or, in the event such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such
record date, by multiplying the applicable Conversion Price then in effect for each series of
Preferred Stock by a fraction equal to:

(1) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the
close of business on such record date, and

(2) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the

-8-
$V536128.5
close of business on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in
payment of such dividend or distribution;

provided, however, that if such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend is not fully
paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the applicable Conversion
Price for each series of Preferred Stock shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of
business on such record date and thereafter the applicable Conversion Price for each series of
Preferred Stock shall be adjusted pursuant to this subsection as of the time of actual payment of
such dividends or distributions; and provided further, however, that no such adjustment shall be
made if the holders of Preferred Stock simultaneously receive (i) a dividend or other distribution
of shares of Common Stock in a number equal to the number of shares of Common Stock as they
would have received if all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock had been converted into
Common Stock on the date of such event or (ii) a dividend or other distribution of shares of
Preferred Stock which are convertible, as of the date of such event, into such number of shares of
Common Stock as is equal to the number of additional shares of Common Stock being issued
with respect to each share of Common Stock in such dividend or distribution.

(g) Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. If at any time or from
time to time on or after the Original Issue Date, the Company shall make or issue, or fix a record
date for the determination of holders of capital stock of the Company entitled to receive, a
dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the Company (other than a distribution of
shares of Common Stock in respect of outstanding shares of Common Stock) or in other property
and the provisions of Section 3(f) do not apply to such dividend or distribution, then and in each
such event the holders of Preferred Stock shall receive, simultaneously with the distribution to
the holders of such capital stock, a dividend or other distribution of such securities or other
property in an amount equal to the amount of such securities or other property as they would
have received if all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock had been converted into Common
Stock on the date of such event.

(h) Adjustments for Reorganization, Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets.
If at any time or from time to time on or after the Original Issue Date, the Common Stock
issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or a different
number of shares of any other class or classes of stock, whether by a reorganization, merger or
consolidation of the Company with or into another entity, or the sale of all or substantially all of
the Company’s properties and assets to any other person or entity (other than as provided for
elsewhere in this Section 3 or a transaction subject to Section 2 above) then, as a part of such
reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale, provision shall be made so that the holders of each
series of Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of such series of
Preferred Stock, the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the Company, or
of the successor entity resulting from such merger or consolidation or sale, to which a holder of
Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of each series of Preferred Stock would have been
entitled to receive upon such capital reorganization, merger consolidation or sale. In any such
case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 3
with respect to the rights and interests of the holders of the then outstanding Preferred Stock after
the reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale to the end that the provisions of this Section 3
(including adjustments of the applicable Conversion Price then in effect for each series of

-9-
SV536128.5
Preferred Stock and the number of shares purchasable upon conversion of each series of
Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event as nearly equivalent as may be practicable.

(i) Adjustments for Dilutive Issuances.

(i) If at any time or from time to time on or after the Original Issue
Date, the Company shall issue or sell any shares of Common Stock (as actually issued or,
pursuant to paragraph (iii) below, deemed to be issued) for a consideration per share less than the
Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such issue or
sale, then immediately upon such issue or sale the Conversion Price for each such series of
Preferred Stock shall be reduced to a price (calculated to the nearest cent) determined by
multiplying the applicable Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale
by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Calculated Securities (as
hereinafter defined) outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale plus the number of
shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration received by the Company for the
total number of shares of Common Stock so issued or sold (or deemed to be issued or sold)
would purchase at the applicable Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance
or sale, and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Calculated Securities
outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale plus the number of shares of Common Stock.
so issued or sold. “Calculated Securities” means (A) all shares of Common Stock actually
outstanding and (B) all shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise, conversion or exchange
of all Convertible Securities (as hereinafter defined).

(ii) For the purposes of paragraph (i) above, none of the following
issuances (or deemed issuances) shall be considered the issuance (or deemed issuance) or sale of
Common Stock:

(A) The issuance of Common Stock upon the conversion of any
outstanding Convertible Securities as of the date hereof or upon the conversion of the Preferred
Stock, including the issuance of Common Stock as payment for any declared and unpaid
dividends (or unpaid accrued dividends whether or not declared, in the case of the Series B
Preferred) on such Preferred Stock. “Convertible Securities” shall mean any bonds, debentures,
notes or other evidences of indebtedness, and any stock, options, warrants, purchase rights or any
other securities convertible into, exercisable for, or exchangeable for Common Stock.

(B) The issuance of shares of Series B Preferred and/or the
issuance of Common Stock upon the conversion of any Series B Preferred, in either case issued
after the date hereof pursuant to a Subsequent Closing or Milestone Closing (as defined in the
Series B Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement, dated on or about the date of filing of this
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware (the “Purchase Agreement’’)).

(C) Shares of Common Stock issued or issuable by reason of a
dividend, stock split, split up or other distribution on shares of Common Stock that is covered by
Section 3(f) or Section 3(g) above and shares of Common Stock issued or deemed issued as a
dividend or Distribution on Preferred Stock.

-10-
$V\536128.5
(D) Shares of Common Stock and/or options, warrants or other
Common Stock purchase rights and the Common Stock issued or issuable pursuant to such
options, warrants or other rights after the Original Issue Date to employees, officers or directors
of, or consultants or advisors to, the Company or any subsidiary pursuant to stock purchase or
stock option plans or other arrangements that are approved by the Board of Directors, including a
majority of the Preferred Directors (as hereinafter defined).

(iii) | For the purposes of paragraph (i) above, the following
subparagraphs (A) to (E), inclusive, shall also be applicable:

(A) Incase at any time the Company shall grant any warrants, rights or
options to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire Convertible Securities or Common Stock
(excluding Convertible Securities and Common Stock issued in accordance with Section 3(i)(ii) -
above) (collectively ““Options”’) or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders entitled
to receive such Options, whether or not such Options are immediately exercisable, and the price
per share for which Common Stock is issuable upon the exercise of such Options (determined by
dividing (x) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Company as consideration for
the granting of such Options, plus the minimum aggregate amount of-additional consideration
payable to the Company upon the exercise of such Options, plus, in the case of any such Options
which relate to such Convertible Securities, the minimum aggregate amount of additional
consideration, if any, payable upon the issue or sale of such Convertible Securities and upon the
conversion or exchange thereof, by (y) the total maximum number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon the exercise of such Options or upon the conversion or exchange of all such
Convertible Securities issuable upon the exercise of such Options as set forth in the instrument
relating thereto assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to the exercisability, convertibility or

$W\S36128.5
exchangeability) shall be less than the applicable Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to
the time of the granting of such Options, then the total maximum number of shares of Common
Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Options or upon conversion or exchange of the total
maximum amount of such Convertible Securities issuable upon the exercise of such Options
shall (as of the date of granting of such Options) be deemed to be outstanding and to have been
issued for such price per share.

(B) Incase at any time the Company shall issue or sell any Convertible
Securities (excluding Convertible Securities and Common Stock issued in accordance with
Section 3(i)(ii) above), whether or not the rights to exchange or convert thereunder are
immediately exercisable, and the price per share for which Common Stock is issuable upon such
exercise, conversion or exchange (determined by dividing (x) the total amount received or
receivable by the Company as consideration for the issue or sale of such Convertible Securities,
plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to the Company
upon the exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, by (y) the total maximum number of shares
of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of all such Convertible
Securities as set forth in the instrument relating thereto assuming the satisfaction of any
conditions to the exercisability, convertibility or exchangeability) shall be less than the
Conversion Price in effect for any series of Preferred Stock immediately prior to the time of such
issue or sale, then the total maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
exercise, conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities shall (as of the date of the issue
or sale of such Convertible Securities) be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued for
such price per share, provided that if any such issue or sale of such Convertible Securities is
made upon exercise of any rights to subscribe for or to purchase or any option to purchase any
such Convertible Securities for which adjustments of the conversion price have been or are to be
made pursuant to other provisions of this paragraph (iii), no further adjustment of the conversion
price shall be made by reason of such issue or sale.

(C) Incase at any time any shares of Common Stock, Convertible
Securities or Options shall be issued or sold for cash, the consideration received therefor shall be
deemed to be the amount received by the Company therefor. In case any shares of Common
Stock, Convertible Securities or Options shall be issued or sold for a consideration other than
cash, the amount of the consideration other than cash received by the Company shall be deemed
to be the fair value of such consideration as determined by the Board of Directors, including a
majority of the Preferred Directors. In case any shares of Common Stock, Convertible Securities
or Options shall be issued in connection with any merger of another entity into the Company, the
amount of consideration therefor shall be deemed to be the fair value of the assets of such
merged corporation as determined by the Board of Directors, including a majority of the
Preferred Directors, after deducting therefrom all cash and other consideration (if any) paid by
the Company in connection with such merger.

(D) If the terms of any Convertible Security or Option (excluding
Convertible Securities or Options issued in accordance with Section 3(i)(ii) above), the issuance
of which resulted in an adjustment to the Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock
pursuant to the terms of this Section 3(i), are revised (either automatically pursuant to the
provisions contained therein or as a result of an amendment to such terms) to provide for either

-12-
$V\536128.5
(1) any increase or decrease in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the
exercise, conversion or exchange of any such Convertible Security or Option or (2) any increase
or decrease in the consideration payable to the Company upon such exercise, conversion or
exchange, then, effective upon such increase or decrease becoming effective, the Conversion
Price for such series of Preferred Stock computed upon the original issue of such Convertible
Security or Option (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto) shall be
readjusted to such Conversion Price as would have been obtained had such revised terms been in
effect upon the original date of issuance of such Convertible Security or Option.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment pursuant to this paragraph (D) shall have the effect
of increasing the Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock to an amount which exceeds
the lower of (i) the Conversion Price for each such series of Preferred Stock on the original
adjustment date, or (ii) the Conversion Price for each such series of Preferred Stock that would
have resulted from any issuances of shares of Common Stock without consideration or for a
consideration per share less than the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issue
or sale between the original adjustment date and such readjustment date.

(E) If the original issuance of any Convertible Security or Option
(excluding Convertible Securities or Options which, upon exercise, conversion or exchange
thereof, would entitle the holder thereof to receive securities issued in accordance with Section
3(i)Gii) above), did not result in an adjustment to the Conversion Price for any series of Preferred
Stock pursuant to the terms of Section 3(i), either because (1) the consideration per share
(determined pursuant to Section 3(i)(iii)(C) above) of the Common Stock was equal to or greater
than the Conversion Price then in effect for such series of Preferred Stock, or (2) such
Convertible Security was issued before the date of filing of this Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, are revised after the date of filing of this Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation (either automatically pursuant to the provisions contained therein or
as a result of an amendment to such terms) to provide for either (A) any increase or decrease in
the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of
any such Convertible Security or Option or (B) any increase or decrease in the consideration
payable to the Company upon such exercise, conversion or exchange, then such Convertible
Security or Option, as so amended, and the Common Stock subject thereto (determined in the
manner provided in Subsection 3(i)(ii)(A) and (B) above, as applicable) shall be deemed to have
been issued effective upon such increase or decrease becoming effective.

(j) Certificate of Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment of
the Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 3, the Company at
its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment and furnish to each holder of such series of
Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment and showing in detail the facts upon
which such adjustment is based. The Company shall, as promptly as practicable, upon the
written request at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock, furnish to such holder a like
certificate setting forth (i) any and all adjustments made to the Conversion Price for such series
of Preferred Stock since the date of the first issuance of such series of Preferred Stock, (ii) the
Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock at the time in effect, and (iii) the number of
shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be
received upon the conversion of such series of Preferred Stock.

-13-
SV\536128.5
(k) Notices of Record Date. In the event that the Company shall propose at
any time (i) to declare any dividend or distribution; (ii) to effect any reclassification or
recapitalization; or (iii) to effect a Liquidation; then, in connection with each such event, the
Company shall send to the holders of the Preferred Stock written notice at least 20 days prior to
the record date or effective date for such event. The notice shall specify, as the case may be, (i)
the record date for such dividend, distribution or right, and the amount and character of such
dividend, distribution or right, or (ii) the effective date on which such reclassification,
recapitalization or Liquidation is proposed to take place, and the time, if any is to be fixed, as of
which the holders of record of Common Stock (or such other stock or securities at the time
issuable upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of
Common Stock (or such other stock or securities) for securities or other property deliverable
upon such reclassification, recapitalization or Liquidation, and the amount per share and
character of such exchange applicable to each series of Preferred Stock and the Common Stock.
Any notice required by the provisions hereof to be given to a holder of shares of Preferred Stock
shall be deemed sent to such holder if deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, and
addressed to such holder at such holder’s address appearing on the books of the Company.

() Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Company shall at
all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock, .
solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock, such
number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, the Company will take such corporate
action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary (including, without limitation, engaging
in reasonable best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any amendment to this
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation) to increase its authorized but unissued

shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.

4. Voting.

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or as required by law, the
holders of Preferred Stock and the holders of Common Stock shall vote together and not as
separate classes, including, but not limited to, with respect to any increase or decrease of the
authorized shares of Common Stock. The number of authorized shares of Common Stock may
be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares of Common Stock then
outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock of the Company
entitled to vote (voting together as a single class on an as-converted basis).

(b) Preferred Stock. Each holder of shares of Preferred Stock shall be entitled
to the number of votes equal to the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares
of Preferred Stock held by such holder could then be converted. The holders of the Preferred
Stock shall be entitled to notice of any stockholders’ meeting in accordance with the bylaws of
the Company. Fractional votes shall not, however, be permitted and any fractional voting rights
resulting from the above formula (after aggregating all shares of Common Stock into which
shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder could be converted), shall be disregarded.

-14-
$V\536128.5
(c) | Common Stock. Each holder of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled
to one vote for each share thereof held.

(d) Election of Directors. The holders of the Preferred Stock, voting
separately as a single class (on an as-converted to Common Stock basis), shall be entitled to elect
three (3) directors (the “Preferred Directors”). The holders of the Common Stock, voting
separately as a single class, shall be entitled to elect two (2) directors. The holders of the
Common Stock and the Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class (on an as-converted to
Common Stock basis), shall be entitled to elect any other directors of the Company. Any
director elected pursuant to this Section 4(d) may be removed with or without cause only by the
affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of the class, series or classes of stock entitled to elect
such director or directors. Any vacancies on the Board of Directors shall be filled by vote of the
holders of the class, series or classes that elected the director pursuant to this Section 4(d) whose
absence created such vacancy.

5. Amendments and Changes.

(a) Approval by Series B Preferred. Notwithstanding Section 4 above and in —
addition to any vote otherwise required herein or by law, the approval (by vote or written consent
as provided by law) of at least a two-thirds majority of the Series B Preferred then outstanding,
voting together as a single, separate class (on an as-converted to Common Stock basis) shall be
necessary for effecting or validating the following actions (whether by merger, recapitalization
or otherwise):

(i) any consummation of a Liquidation, any consolidation or merger
of the Company with or into any other corporation or other entity or person, or any other
corporate reorganization, any transaction or series of related transactions to which the Company
is a party in which in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the Company’s voting power is transferred,
or a sale, lease, exclusive license or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company;

(ii) any amendment, alteration, repeal or waiver of any provision of
this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the bylaws of the Company;

(iii) any authorization, creation or issuance of any securities of the
Company having rights, preferences or privileges senior to, or pari passu with, any of the rights,
preferences or privileges of any series of the Preferred Stock;

(iv) any increase in the authorized number of shares of Preferred Stock;

(v) any redemption (other than pursuant to Section 7 below) or
repurchase of shares of the Company’s stock or securities, or the payment of any dividend on
shares of the Company’s stock or securities, prior to redemption, repurchase or the payment of a
dividend on any series of the Preferred Stock, except in connection with the repurchase of shares
of Common Stock issued to or held by employees, consultants, officers or directors upon
termination of their employment or services pursuant to agreements providing for the right of

-15-
SV\536128.5
said repurchase, which agreements were approved by the Board of Directors, including a
majority of the Preferred Directors;

(vi) the creation of any debt security, other than equipment leases or
bank lines of credit, if the Company’s aggregate indebtedness would exceed $100,000; provided
that such approval shall not be required if the creation of such debt security has been approved
by the Company’s Board of Directors, including a majority of the Preferred Directors;

(vii) any change in the authorized number of directors of the Company;

(viii) the adoption of any stock option or equity compensation plans,
other than a plan approved by the Company’s Board of Directors, including a majority of the
Preferred Directors; or

(ix) the issuance of any shares of Series B Preferred, other than

6. Special Mandatory Conversion.

(a) In the event that any holder of Series B Preferred does not purchase the
number of shares it is obligated to purchase in the Milestone Closing (as defined in the Purchase
Agreement) set forth on the Schedule of Purchasers to the Purchase Agreement in accordance
with the terms of the Purchase Agreement, all of the shares of Series B Preferred held by such
holder shall automatically, and without any further action on the part of such holder, be
converted into shares of Common Stock at the applicable Conversion Price in effect immediately
prior to the Milestone Closing, effective upon, subject to, and concurrently with, the
consummation of the Milestone Closing. Upon such conversion (a “Special Mandatory
Conversion’), any shares of Series B Preferred so converted shall be cancelled and not subject to
reissuance.

(b) | Upon a Special Mandatory Conversion, each holder of shares of Series B
Preferred converted pursuant to Section 6(a) above shall surrender his, her or its certificate or
certificates for all such shares to the Company at the place designated in such notice, and shall
thereafter receive a certificate for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to this Section 6. All rights with respect to the Series B Preferred converted
pursuant to Section 6(a), including the rights, if any, to receive notices and vote (other than as a
holder of Common Stock), will terminate, except only the rights of the holders thereof, upon
surrender of their certificate or certificates therefor, to receive certificates for the number of
shares of Common Stock into which such Series B Preferred has been converted, and payment of
any unpaid accrued dividends (whether or not declared) thereon. If so required by the Company,
certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by written instrument
or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Company, duly executed by the registered
holder or by his, her or its attorney duly authorized in writing. As soon as practicable after the
Special Mandatory Conversion and the surrender of the certificate or certificates for Series B
Preferred so converted, the Company shall cause to be issued and delivered to such holder a
certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable on such

-16-
$V1536128.5
conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof, cash in respect of any fraction of a share of
Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion and payment of any unpaid accrued
dividends (whether or not declared) on the Series B Preferred so converted. All certificates
evidencing shares of Series B Preferred cancelled, and the shares of Series B Preferred converted
pursuant to Section 6(a) represented thereby shall, from and after the time of the Special
Mandatory Conversion, be deemed to have been converted into Common Stock for all purposes,
notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender such certificates on or
prior to such date.

In the event that there are any unpaid accrued dividends (whether or not declared) on any
Series B Preferred converted upon a Special Mandatory Conversion, the Company shall issue to
the holder of the Series B Preferred so converted that number of fully-paid and nonassessable
shares of Common Stock that is equal to the amount of such dividends divided by the per share
fair market value of the Common Stock as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

7. Redemption.

(a) Neither the Series A-1 Preferred nor the Series A-2 Preferred shall be
redeemable.

(b) At the election of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series B
Preferred, delivered to the Company at least 75 days prior to the Initial Redemption Date (as
hereinafter defined), the Company shall redeem, on the terms and conditions stated herein, out of
funds legally available therefor, all of the outstanding Series B Preferred issued on the Original
Issue Date, or at one or more Subsequent Closings (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) (the
“Tranche 1 Series B Preferred’’) and all of the outstanding Series B Preferred issued on the
Milestone Closing (the “Tranche 2 Series B Preferred”) in two (2) equal installments, with the
first installment payable on the date designated by such holders, which date shall not be earlier
than (i) the fifth anniversary of the Original Issue Date in the case of the Tranche 1 Series B
Preferred and (ii) the fifth anniversary of the Milestone Closing in the case of the Tranche 2
Series B Preferred (each an “Initial Redemption Date”), and the second installment payable on
the first anniversary of the applicable Initial Redemption Date (together with the applicable
Initial Redemption Date, each a “Redemption Date’’), by paying on each Redemption Date a sum
(the “Redemption Price’’) equal to the greater of (i) the liquidation preference applicable to such
share of Preferred Stock as set forth in Section 2(a) or (ii) the Fair Market Value (as hereinafter
defined) of such share of Series B Preferred, determined as set forth in Section 7(c) below.

(c) “Fair Market Value” shal] mean the fair market value of a share of Series
B Preferred, as determined by an independent third party appraiser of recognized standing
selected by the Board of Directors, including a majority of the Preferred Directors (an
“Appraiser”); provided that no discount for lack of marketability or a minority interest, if
applicable, shall be applied in such appraisal. The Company shall pay the reasonable fees of the
Appraiser in making such determination in connection with the redemption of the Series B
Preferred.

(d) ‘In the event that the Company is unable to redeem the full number of
shares of Series B Preferred to be redeemed on any Redemption Date, the shares not redeemed

-17-
$V536128.5
shall be redeemed by the Company as provided in this Section 7 as soon as practicable after the
funds are legally available therefor. Any redemption effected pursuant to this Section 7(d) shall
be made pro rata among the holders of the Series B Preferred in proportion to the aggregate
Redemption Price to which each holder is entitled under Section 7(b).

(e) If the holders of the Series B Preferred have elected to have the shares of
Series B Preferred redeemed as provided in Section 7(b), then at least 30 but no more than 60
days prior to each Redemption Date, the Company shall give written notice via personal delivery
or first class mail, postage prepaid, to all holders of the outstanding Series B Preferred whose
shares are being redeemed, at the address last shown on the records of the Company for such
holder, stating the applicable Redemption Date, Redemption Price and Conversion Price for such
shares, and the date of termination of the right to convert (which date shall not be earlier than 30
days after the written notice by the Company has been given), and the Company shall cail upon
such holder to surrender to the Company on such Redemption Date at the place designated in the
notice such holder’s certificate or certificates representing the shares to be redeemed. On or after
the Redemption Date stated in such notice, the holder of each share of Series B Preferred called
for redemption shall surrender the certificate evidencing such shares to the Company at the place
designated in such notice and shal] thereupon be entitled to receive payment of the Redemption
Price for the shares surrendered. If less than all of the shares represented by any such certificate
are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares. If such
notice of redemption shall have been duly given, and if on such Redemption Date, funds
necessary for the redemption shall be available therefor, then, as to any certificates evidencing
any Series B Preferred so called for redemption and not surrendered, all rights of the holders of
such shares so called for redemption and not surrendered shall cease with respect to such shares,
except only the right of such holders to receive the Redemption Price for such shares called for
redemption which they hold, without interest, upon surrender of the certificates therefor.

8. Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Article FOURTH to be
given to the holders of Preferred Stock shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if deposited
in the United States mail, postage prepaid, if deposited with a nationally recognized overnight
courier, or if personally delivered, and addressed to each holder of record at such holder’s
address appearing on the books of the Company.
