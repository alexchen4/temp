holders of the full preferential amounts, then the entire assets and funds of the Corporation legally

for diluting issues) for each share of Serics B-1 Preferred Stock then held by such holders plus any
and all declared but unpaid dividends. If, after completion of the distributions required by
Sections 2(a), 2(b) and 2(c) above, the remaining assets and funds thus distributed among the holders
of Series B-1 Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full

5
DOCSOC/1231076v4/016907-0019
preferential amounts, then the entire assets and funds of the Corporation legally available for
distribution shall be distributed ratably among the holders of the Series B-1 Preferred Stock in

Preferred Stock, Series F Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock,
Series C Preferred Stock and Series B-! Preferred Stock).

(f) For purposes of this Section2, a merger, consolidation or
reorganization of this Corporation with or into any other corporation or corporations (unless the

hold at least a majority of the outstanding voting equity securities of the surviving entity immediately
after such merger, consolidation or reorganization on substantially the same proportionate ownership
basis as the existing stockholders of the Corporation immediately prior to such merger, consolidation
or reorganization), or a sale or a license on an exclusive basis of all or substantially all of the assets
of this Corporation, shall be treated as a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation.

deemed to have consented, for purposes of Sections 502 and 503 of the California General
Corporation Law to the extent applicable, to distributions made by the Corporation in connection
with the repurchase of shares of Common Stock issued to or held by employees, officers, directors,
advisors, consultant or other persons performing services for the Corporation or any subsidiary upon
termination of their employment or services pursuant to agreements providing for the right of said
repurchase between the Corporation and such persons.

(h) In any of the events specified in Section 2(f) hereof, if the
consideration received by the Corporation is other than cash, the value of such consideration will be
deemed its fair market value, as determined in good faith by the Board (which determination shall
include the approval of a majority of the directors elected to the Board and the holders of at least a
majority of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class on an as-
converted into Common Stock basis); provided, however, that any securities thus received shall be
valued as follows:

(i) Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar
restrictions on free marketability:

(1) If traded on a securities exchange, the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange over the thirty-day
period ending three (3) days prior to the closing;

(2) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the thirty-
day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing; and

DOCSOC/1231076v4/016907-0019
(3) If there is no active public market, the value shall be
the fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board (which determination shall
include the approval of a majority of the directors elected to the Board and the holders of at least a
majority of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class on an as-
converted into Common Stock basis).

(ii) The method of valuation of securities subject to investment
letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of a
stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount from
the market value determined as above in (i) (1), (2) or (3) to reflect the approximate fair market value
thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board (which determination shall include the approval of
a majority of the directors elected to the Board and the holders of at least a majority of the
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class on an as-converted into
Common Stock basis).

(i) In the event the requirements of this Section 2 are not complied with,
this Corporation shall forthwith either:

(i) cause such closing to be postponed until such time as the
requirements of this Section 2 have been complied with; or

(ii) cancel such transaction, in which event the rights, preferences
and privileges of the holders of the Preferred Stock shall revert to and be the same as such rights,
preferences and privileges existing immediately prior to the date of the first notice referred to in
Section 2(j) below.

Qj) The Corporation shall give each holder of record of Preferred Stock
written notice of such impending transaction as referred to in Section 2(f) hereof not later than
twenty (20) days prior to the stockholders’ meeting called to approve such transaction, or twenty (20)
days prior to the closing of such transaction, whichever is earlier, and shall also notify such holders
in writing of the final approval of such transaction. The first of such notices shall describe the
material terms and conditions of the impending transaction and the provisions of this Section 2, and
the Corporation shall thereafter give such holders prompt notice of any material changes. The
transaction shall in no event take place sooner than twenty (20) days after the Corporation has given
the first notice provided for herein or sooner than ten (10) days after the Corporation has given notice
of any material changes provided for herein; provided, however, that such periods may be shortened
upon the written consent of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Preferred
Stock, on an as-converted into Common Stock basis.

3. Redemption.

(a) Series G Preferred Stock, Series F Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred
Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and Series B-1 Preferred Stock. The

Corporation shall not have the right to call or redeem at any time all or any shares of the Preferred

Rights”):

(i) Redemption Rights. The holders of Preferred Stock shall not
be entitled to require the Corporation to redeem any shares of Preferred Stock prior to July 31, 2012.

DOCSOC/1231076v4/016907-0019
Subject to the rights of any other series of Preferred Stock which may from time to time come into
existence, at any time after July 31, 2012, upon the affirmative vote or written consent of the holders
of at least a majority of the then outstanding shares of a series of Preferred Stock, voting separately
as a class (the “Redemption Request”), the Corporation shall redeem all issued, outstanding and
unconverted shares of such series of Preferred Stock at the applicable Redemption Price (as defined
below) as provided herein from any source of funds legally available therefor; provided, however,
(a) that no shares of Series D Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock, Series F Preferred Stock or
Series G Preferred Stock may be redeemed unless all outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock,
Series E Preferred Stock, Series F Preferred Stock and Series G Preferred Stock are redeemed, unless
otherwise approved with respect to any such series by the affirmative vote or written consent of at
least a majority of the then outstanding shares of the Series D Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred
Stock, Series F Preferred Stock or Series G Preferred Stock, respectively, as applicable; (b) that no
shares of Series C Preferred Stock or Series B-1 Preferred Stock may be redeemed if there are any
then outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock, Series F Preferred
Stock or Series G Preferred Stock; and (c) that no shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock may be
redeemed if there are any then outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock. Subject to the above,
the Corporation shall redeem all shares of the applicable series of Preferred Stock outstanding as of
the date of such vote or written consent of such series upon payment of the applicable Redemption
Price for the shares so redeemed no later than 45 days after the receipt of a Redemption Request (the
“Redemption Date”). If the funds of the Corporation legally available for redemption of the
applicable series of Preferred Stock on the Redemption Date are insufficient to redeem the total
number of outstanding shares of such series of Preferred Stock on the Redemption Date, those funds
which are legally available will be used to redeem the maximum number of shares of such series of
Preferred Stock ratably among the holders of such series of Preferred Stock. If, and only if, no funds
or insufficient funds are available to the Corporation at the applicable Redemption Date to meet the
Corporation’s redemption obligations pursuant to this Section 3{a)(i), then the Corporation’s
obligations to redeem shares of the applicable series of Preferred Stock shall continue and at any time
thereafter when additional funds of the Corporation are legally available for the redemption of such
series of Preferred Stock, the Corporation, within ten (10) business days, shall use such funds to
redeem the balance of the shares which the Corporation has become obligated to redeem on the
applicable Redemption Date but which it has not redeemed. The shares of the Preferred Stock which
have not been redeemed shall continue to be entitled to the dividend, conversion and other rights,
preferences, privileges and restrictions of such series of Preferred Stock.

(ii) The redemption price for each share of Preferred Stock
repurchased (the “Redemption Price”) shall be equal to the sum of (a) the applicable Initial Issue
Price (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations and similar events) plus
(b) any and all declared but unpaid dividends payable in accordance with Section 1(C) above on each
such share to be redeemed.

(iii) Within ten (10) business days of the Corporation’s receipt of a
valid Redemption Request, the Corporation will mail written notice, first class postage prepaid, to
each holder of record (at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which
notice is given) of shares to be redeemed, at the address for such holder as it appears on the stock
transfer books of the Corporation, notifying such holder of the redemption, specifying the
Redemption Date upon which the Corporation shall satisfy the applicable Redemption Request, the
applicable Redemption Price, the place at which payment may be obtained and the date on which
such holder’s conversion nights as to such shares terminate, and calling upon such holder to surrender
to the Corporation, in the manner and at the place designated, its certificate or certificates

8
DOCSOC/1 231076v4/016907-0019
representing the shares to be redeemed (the “Redemption Notice”). On or after the applicable
Redemption Date, each holder of shares to be redeemed shall surrender to the Corporation the
certificate or certificates representing such shares to be redcemed, in the manner and at the place
designated in the Redemption Notice, and thereupon the applicable Redemption Price of such shares
shall be payable to the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as
the owner thereof. In the event that less than all the shares represented by any such certificate are
redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares.

(iv) | From and after the applicable Redemption Date, unless there
shall have been a default in payment of the applicable Redemption Price, all rights of the holders of
the shares thereupon redeemed, as holders of shares of such Preferred Stock (except the right to
receive the applicable Redemption Price upon surrender of their certificate or certificates), shall
cease with respect to such shares, and such shares shall not thereafter be transferred on the books of
this Corporation or be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose whatsoever. The shares not
redeemed shall remain outstanding and entitled to all the rights and preferences provided herein.

(v) If there has been a default in the payment of the applicable
Redemption Price, other than by reason of the Corporation’s inability to redeem the Preferred Stock
as required by the provisions of Section 3(a)(i) above, then during the period from the applicable
Redemption Date through the date on which such shares are redeemed, the redemption price of such
shares not redeemed will bear interest at a per-annum rate equal to the lower of 15% or the highest
rate permitted by law, payable quarterly in arrears.

4. Voting Rights.

(a) Voting Other than for Directors. Subject to the provisions of
Section 4(b) hereof, on all matters to come before the stockholders, the holder of each outstanding
share of the Preferred Stock shall have that number of votes per share (rounded up to the nearest
whole share) equivalent to the number of shares of Common Stock into which such share of
Preferred Stock is convertible determined by reference to the applicable Conversion Price (as such
terms are defined in Section 5(b) hereof), in effect at the record date of the determination of the
holders of the shares entitled to vote or, if no such record date is established, at the date such vote is
taken or any written consent of stockholders is first solicited, which vote may be cast as provided by
the laws of the State of Delaware, this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and
the Corporation’s Bylaws. Except as otherwise provided by law or in this Fourth Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of the Preferred Stock shall vote with the holders of
the outstanding shares of Common Stock as a single class, and not as separate classes or series.

Stock, voting as a separate class, shall be entitled to elect two (2) directors to the Board.

director elected pursuant to Section 4(b)(i), then a successor to hold office for the unexpired term of

DOCSOC/1231076v4/01 6907-0019
such director may be elected by the affirmative vote of the same class of holders who elected such
director, which, if by written consent, must be unanimous written consent if the vacancy is created by
removal.

(iii) Removal. Subject to Section 141 of the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware, any director who shall have been elected to the Board by the
stockholders pursuant to Section 4(b)(i), may be removed during his or her term of office, either with
or without cause, by the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of the same class of
holders entitled to vote for such director, given either at a meeting of such holders duly called for that
purpose or pursuant to a written consent of such holders without a meeting, and any vacancy created
by such removal may be filled only in the manner provided in Section 4(b)(ii).

(iv) General Election of Remaining Directors. Except as provided
in Section 4(b)(i) hereof, the holders of the Common Stock and the Preferred Stock shall be entitled

to vote together in accordance with the requirements of Section 4(a) with respect to the election of
any other director or directors to the Board, if any.

5. Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights

as follows (the “Conversion Rights”):
(a) Right to Convert.

(i) Each share of the Preferred Stock shall be convertible,
without payment of any additional consideration by the holder thereof, at the option of the holder

transfer agent for the shares of capital stock of the Corporation, into that number of the fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined in accordance with the provisions of

same and setting forth the name or names the holder wishes the certificate or certificates for
Common Stock to be issued, and the number of shares of the Preferred Stock being converted;
provided, however, that in the event of an automatic conversion pursuant to Section 5(d), the

be deerned to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such
surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to
receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes

10
DOCSOC/1231076v4/016907-0019

for such share in effect at the time into the applicable Initial Issue Price for such share.

(d) Automatic Conversion.

(i) Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be
converted into shares of Common Stock, at the then effective applicable Conversion Price with
respect to such share, effective upon the earlier of (1) the closing of a firm commitment underwritten

together as a single class on an as-converted into Common Stock basis, in favor of the conversion of
all of the shares of Preferred Stock.

(ii) Special Automatic Conversion of Preferred Stock. If (1) at
the Initial Closing, as such term is defined in that certain Series G Preferred Stock and Common

Stock Warrant Purchase Agreement dated on or about July 27, 2007 (the “Purchase Agreement’),
any holder of Series B-1 Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, Series
E Preferred Stock or Series F Preferred Stock (or its affiliates, designees or successor funds, as the
case may be) does not (A) commit to purchase in cash such holder’s Pro Rata Share (as defined
below) of the aggregate of 50,000,000 shares (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations or
splits with respect to such shares) of Series G Preferred Stock proposed for sale and issuance by the
Corporation, and (B) purchase in cash such holder’s Pro Rata Share of the 23,333.333 shares (as
adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations or splits with respect to such shares) of Series G
Preferred proposed for sale and issuance by the Corporation in the Initial Closing, or (2) at one or
more Additional Closing(s), as such term is defined in the Purchase Agreement, such holder does not
purchase in cash such holder’s Pro Rata Share on that portion of the remaining 26,666,667 shares (as
adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations or splits with respect to such shares) proposed for
sale and issuance by the Corporation in such Additional Closing, then, automatically and without
further action on the part of such holder or the Corporation, such holder’s shares (including
derivative securities) of Series B-1 Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred
Stock, Series E Preferred Stock, Series F Preferred Stock and Series G Preferred Stock, as applicable,

Conversion Price for the relevant series without any adjustment pursuant to any provision of Section
5(e) below. For purposes of this Section 5(d)(ii), a holder’s “Pro Rata Share” with respect to the
Initial Closing and each Additional Closing shall be that number of shares of Series G Preferred
Stock that equals (X) the number of shares of Series G Preferred Stock proposed for sale and
issuance by the Corporation at such Initial Closing or Additional Closing, as applicable, multiplied
by (Y) a fraction, the numerator of which equals the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock
(assuming full conversion of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, and the exercise and
conversion of all outstanding warrants to purchase or rights to subscribe for Preferred Stock) held by
such holder, and the denominator of which equals the total number of outstanding shares of Common
Stock (assuming full conversion of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, and the exercise and
conversion of all outstanding warrants to purchase or rights to subscribe for Preferred Stock) held by
all holders of Series B-1 Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, Series
E Preferred Stock, Series F Preferred Stock, and Series G Preferred Stock. Upon conversion
pursuant to this Section 5(d)(ii), the shares of Preferred Stock so converted shall be cancelled and not
subject to reissuance.

(e) Conversion Price Adjustments for Certain Dilutive Issuances, Splits

and Combinations. The Series B-1 Conversion Price, the Series C Conversion Price, the Series D
Conversion Price, the Series E Conversion Price, the Series F Conversion Price, and the Series G
Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

(i) Adjustments of Series G Conversion Price for Issue or Sale of

Additional Stock. If the Corporation shall issue any Additional Stock (as defined below) without
consideration or for a consideration per share which is less than the Series G Conversion Price in
effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock, then, and in each such case, the
Series G Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall automatically be

12
DOCSOC/1 23 1076v4/016907-0019
adjusted (except as otherwise provided in Section S(e)(vi) hereof) to a price determined by
multiplying such Series G Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance plus the number
of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for the total
number of shares of Additional Stock so issued would purchase at the then current Series G
Conversion Price; and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares of Additional Stock so
issued. For the purpose of the above calculation, the number of shares of Common Stock deemed
outstanding immediately prior to such issue shall be calculated on a fully diluted basis, as if all shares
of Preferred Stock had been fully converted into shares of Common Stock immediately prior to such
issuance and any outstanding warrants, options or other rights for the purchase of shares of stock or
convertible securities had been fully exercised immediately prior to such issuance (and the resulting
securities fully converted into shares of Common Stock, if so convertible) as of such date.

(ii) Adjustments of Series F Conversion Price for Issue or Sale of
Additional Stock. If the Corporation shall issue any Additional Stock without consideration or for a

consideration per share which is less than the Series F Conversion Price in effect immediately prior
to the issuance of such Additional Stock, then, and in each such case, the Sertes F Conversion Price
in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall automatically be adjusted (except as otherwise
provided in Section 5(e)(vi) hereof) to a price determined by multiplying such Series F Conversion
Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the
aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for the total number of shares of Additional
Stock so issued would purchase at the then current Series F Conversion Price; and the denominator
of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such
issuance plus the number of shares of Additional Stock so issued. For the purpose of the above
calculation, the number of shares of Common Stock deemed outstanding immediately prior to such
issue shall be calculated on a fully diluted basis, as if all shares of Preferred Stock had been fully
converted into shares of Common Stock immediately prior to such issuance and any outstanding
warrants, options or other rights for the purchase of shares of stock or convertible securities had been
fully exercised immediately prior to such issuance (and the resulting securities fully converted into
shares of Common Stock, if so convertible) as of such date.

(iii) Adjustments of Series E Conversion Price for Issue or Sale of
Additional Stock. If the Corporation shall issue any Additional Stock without consideration or for a

consideration per share which is less than the Series E Conversion Price in effect immediately prior
to the issuance of such Additional Stock, then, and in each such case, the Series E Conversion Price
in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall automatically be adjusted (except as otherwise
provided in Section S({e)(vi) hereof) to a price determined by multiplying such Series E Conversion
Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the
aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for the total number of shares of Additional
Stock so issued would purchase at the then current Series E Conversion Price; and the denominator
of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such
issuance plus the number of shares of Additional Stock so issued. For the purpose of the above
calculation, the number of shares of Common Stock deemed outstanding immediately prior to such
issue shall be calculated on a fully diluted basis, as if all shares of Preferred Stock had been fully
converted into shares of Common Stock immediately prior to such issuance and any outstanding
warrants, options or other rights for the purchase of shares of stock or convertible securities had been

13
DOCSOC/1231076v4/016907-0019
fully exercised immediately prior to such issuance (and the resulting securities fully converted into
shares of Common Stock, if so convertible) as of such date.

(iv) Adjustments of Series D Conversion Price for Issue or Sale of
Additional Stock. If the Corporation shall issue any Additional Stock without consideration or for a

consideration per share which is less than the Series D Conversion Price in effect immediately prior
to the issuance of such Additional Stock, then, and in each such case, the Series D Conversion Price
in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall automatically be adjusted (except as otherwise
provided in Section 5(e)(vi) hereof) to a price determined by multiplying such Series D Conversion
Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the
aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for the total number of shares of Additional
Stock so issued would purchase at the then current Series D Conversion Price; and the denominator
of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such
issuance plus the number of shares of Additional Stock so issued. For the purpose of the above
calculation, the number of shares of Common Stock deemed outstanding immediately prior to such
issue shall be calculated on a fully diluted basis, as if all shares of Preferred Stock had been fully
converted into shares of Common Stock immediately prior to such issuance and any outstanding
warrants, options or other rights for the purchase of shares of stock or convertible securities had been
fully exercised immediately prior to such issuance (and the resulting securities fully converted into
shares of Common Stock, if so convertible) as of such date.

(v) Adjustments of Series B-1 and Series C Conversion Price for
Issue_or Sale of Additional Stock. If the Corporation shall issue any Additional Stock without

consideration or for a consideration per share which is less than the Series C Dilution Price in effect
immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock (the “Series C Dilution Price” shall be
equal to the Series C Conversion Price and shall initially be equal to the Series C Initial Issue Price
and shall be adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations and similar events as
provided herein), then, and in each such case, the Series B-1 Conversion Price, the Series C
Conversion Price and the Series C Dilution Price in effect immediately prior to each such issuance
shall automatically be adjusted (except as otherwise provided in Section 5(e)(vi) hereof) as follows:

(1) the Series C Dilution Price shall be adjusted to a price
determined by multiplying such Series C Dilution Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall
be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance plus the
number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for
the total number of shares of Additional Stock so issued would purchase at the then current Series C
Dilution Price; and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares of Additional Stock so
issued. For the purpose of the above calculation, the number of shares of Common Stock deemed
outstanding immediately prior to such issue shall be calculated on a fully diluted basis, as if all shares
of Preferred Stock had been fully converted into shares of Common Stock immediately prior to such
issuance and any outstanding warrants, options or other rights for the purchase of shares of stock or
convertible securities had been fully exercised immediately prior to such issuance (and the resulting
securities fully converted into shares of Common Stock, if so convertible) as of such date.

(2) the Series B-1 Conversion Price shall be reduced to an
amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the Series B-1 Conversion Price as then in
effect by (B) the quotient obtained by dividing (1) the new SeriesC Dilution Price in effect

14
DOCSOC/1231076v4/016907-0019
immediately subsequent to such issuance of Additional Stock by (2) the Series C Dilution Price in
effect prior to such issuance of Additional Stock. The Series C Conversion Price shall be reduced to
the Series C Dilution Price.

(vi) | Further Provisions for Adjustment of Conversion Price. For
the purpose of Sections 5(e)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) hereof, the following provisions shall be

applicable:

(1) Except to the limited extent provided for in
Section 5(e)(vi)(4)(C) and (D) hereof, no adjustment of the applicable Conversion Price pursuant to
Sections 5(e)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) shall have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price above
the applicable Conversion Price, in effect immediately after the date which the first share of Series G
Preferred Stock was issued (the “Original Issue Date”).

(2) In the case of the issuance of Common Stock for cash,
the consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting any
reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by this Corporation
for any underwniting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

(3) In the case of the issuance of the Common Stock for a
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be deemed
to be the fair valuc thereof as determined in good faith by the Board; provided, however, that any
securities thus received shall be valued pursuant to the procedure set forth in Section 2(h)(i) and (ii)
hereof.

(4) In the case of the issuance (whether before, on or after
the Original Issue Date) of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common Stock, securities
by their terms convertible into or exercisable for Common Stock or options to purchase or rights to
subscribe for such convertible or exercisable securities, the following provisions shall apply for all
purposes of Section 5(e)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v) and (viii) hereof:

(A) | The aggregate maximum number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable upon exercise of such options to purchase or rights to subscribe for
Common Stock shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such options or rights were issued
and for a consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in
Section 5(e)(vi)(2) and (3)), if any, received by the Corporation upon the issuance of such options or
rights plus the minimum exercise price provided in such options or rights for the Common Stock
covered thereby.

(B) The aggregate maximum number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of, or in exchange for, any such convertible or
exchangeable securities or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such
convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof shall be
deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or such options or rights were
issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration, if any, received by the Corporation for any
such securities and related options or rights (excluding any cash received on account of accrued
interest or accrued dividends), plus the minimum additional consideration, if any, to be received by
this Corporation upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or the exercise of any related

15
DOCSOC/!231076v4/016907-0019
options or rights (the consideration in each case to be determined in the manner provided in
Section 5(e)(vi)(2) and (3)).

(C) In the event of any change in the number of
shares of Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon
exercise of such options or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such convertible or
exchangeable securities, including, but not limited to, a change resulting from the antidilution
provisions thereof (unless such options or rights or convertible or exchangeable securities were
merely deemed to be included in the numerator and denominator for purposes of determining the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding for purposes of Sections 5(e)(i), (ii), (iti), (iv) and
(v)), the applicable Conversion Price, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such
options, rights or securities, shall be recomputed to reflect such change, but no further adjustment
shall be made for the actual issuance of Common Stock or any payment of such consideration upon
the exercise of any such options or rights or the conversion or exchange of such securities.

(D) Upon the expiration of any such options or
rights, the termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options or
rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the applicable Conversion Price to the
extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, rights or securities or options or rights
related to such securities (unless such options or rights were merely deemed to be included in the
numerator and denominator for purposes of determining the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding for purposes of Sections 5(e)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v)), shall be recomputed to reflect the
issuance of only the number of shares of Common Stock (and convertible or exchangeable securities
that remain in effect) actually issued upon the exercise of such options or rights, upon the conversion
or exchange of such securities or upon the exercise of the options or rights related to such securities.

(E) The number of shares of Common Stock
deemed issued and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to Section 5(e)(vi)(4)(A) and (B)
shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or expiration of the type described
in either Section 5(e)(vi)(4)(C) or (D).

(vii) “Additional Stock” shall mean any shares of Common Stock
issued (or deemed issued pursuant to Section S(e)(vi)(4)) by this Corporation after the Original Issue
Date other than:

(1) Common Stock issued pursuant to a transaction
described in Section 5(e)(viii) hereof;

(2) 96,142,701 shares of Common Stock issuable or
issued to employees, consultants (including members of the Corporation’s Advisory Board), officers
or directors of this Corporation directly or pursuant to any plan or agreement approved and duly
adopted by the Board;

(3) shares of Common Stock issued as Dividends Payable
in Stock for which adjustment is made pursuant to Section 5(e)(viii) below;

(4) capital stock or warrants or options to purchase capital
stock issued in connection with bona fide acquisitions, mergers or similar transactions, the terms of
which are unanimously approved by the Board;

16
DOCSOC/1231076v4/0 16907-0019
(5) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable upon
conversion of the Preferred Stock;

(6) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable in a
Qualified IPO;

(7) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable in
connection with primarily non-equity financing transactions with lenders, customers, vendors or
other commercial or strategic partners, the terms of which are unanimously approved by the Board;

(8) shares issued upon exercise of (x) currently
outstanding warrants to purchase capital stock of the Corporation, as set forth in Section 3.4 of the
Purchase Agreement, or (y) warrants to purchase capital stock of the Corporation issuable pursuant to
the Purchase Agreement; and

(9) shares that holders of at least a majority of the then
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class on an as-converted into
Common Stock basis, agree shall not constitute “Additional Stock”.

(vii) In the event the Corporation should at any time or from time
to time after the Original Issue Date fix a record date for the effectuation of a split or subdivision of
the outstanding shares of Common Stock or the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled
to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock or other
securities or rights convertible into, or entitling the holder thereof to receive directly or indirectly,
additional shares of Common Stock (hereinafter referred to as “Common Stock Equivalents”)
without payment of any consideration by such holder for the additional shares of Common Stock or
the Common Stock Equivalents (including the additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion or exercise thereof), then, as of such record date (or the date of such dividend,
distribution, split or subdivision if no record date is fixed), each applicable Conversion Price shall be
appropriately decreased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of
each share of Preferred Stock shall be increased in proportion to such increase of the aggregate of
shares of Common Stock outstanding and those issuable with respect to such Common Stock
Equivalents.

(ix) If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any
time after the Original Issue Date is decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock, then, following the record date of such combination, each applicable Conversion
Price shall be appropriately increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on
conversion of each share of such series shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in
outstanding shares.

(f) Other Distributions. In the event the Corporation shall declare a
distribution payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by this
Corporation or other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred to in
Section 5(e)(viii), then, in each such case for the purpose of this Section 5(f), the holders of Preferred
Stock shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any such distribution as though they were the
holders of the number of shares of Common Stock of this Corporation into which their shares of
Preferred Stock are convertible as of the record date fixed for the determination of the holders of
Common Stock of this Corporation entitled to receive such distribution.

17
DOCSOC/1231076v4/016907-0019
(g) Recapitalizations. If at any time or from time to time there shall be a
recapitalization of the Common Stock or capital reorganization, merger or consolidation of the
Corporation with or into another corporation or another entity or person (other than a subdivision,
combination or merger or sale of assets transaction provided for elsewhere in this Section 5 or
Section 2 hereof), provision shall be made so that each holder of Preferred Stock shall thereafter be
entitled to receive upon conversion of the Preferred Stock the number of shares of stock or other
securities or property of the Corporation or otherwise, to which a holder of Common Stock
deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled on such recapitalization, capital
reorganization, merger or consolidation. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in
the application of the provisions of this Section 5 with respect to the nghts of the holders of the
Preferred Stock after the recapitalization to the end that the provisions of this Section 5 (including
adjustment of the applicable Conversion Prices then in effect and the number of shares purchasable
upon conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event as nearly equivalent as
may be practicable.

(h) No Fractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments.

Q) No fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of
any share or shares of the Preferred Stock. Whether fractional shares are issuable upon such
conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock the
holder is at the time converting into Common Stock and the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon such aggregate conversion. If, after the aforementioned aggregation, the conversion
would result in the issuance of a fraction of a share of Common Stock, the Corporation shall, in lieu
of issuing any fractional share, pay the holder otherwise entitled to such fraction a sum in cash equal
to the fair market value of such fraction on the date of conversion (as determined in good faith by the
Board).

(2) Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of
the Conversion Prices pursuant to this Section 5, this Corporation, at its expense, shall promptly
compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and prepare and
furnish to each holder of the applicable series of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such
adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or
readjustment is based. This Corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of
Preferred Stock furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (A) such
adjustment and readjustment, (B) the applicable Conversion Price at the time in effect, and (C) the
number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time
would be received upon the conversion of a share of the applicable series of Preferred Stock.

(i) Notices of Record Date. In the event of any taking by this
Corporation of a record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the
holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend) or other
distribution, any right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of stock of any class
or any other securities or property, or to receive any other right, this Corporation shall mail to each
holder of Preferred Stock, at least twenty (20) days prior to the date specified therein, a notice
specifying the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend,
distribution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right.

(j) Reservation of Stock Issuable upon Conversion. The Corporation
shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common

18
DOCSOC/1 23 1076v4/016907-0019
Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of Preferred Stock, such
number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect a conversion
of all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, and if at any time the number of authorized but
unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then
outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall immediately seek such corporate
action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose. In the
event of a consolidation or merger of the Corporation with another corporation in which the
Corporation is not the surviving corporation, effective provisions shall be made in the certificate or
articles of incorporation, merger or consolidation, or otherwise of the surviving corporation so that
such corporation will at all times reserve and keep available a sufficient number of shares of
Common Stock or other securities or property to provide for the conversion of the Preferred Stock in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.

6. Status of Converted Stock. The Common Stock issuable upon conversion of
the Preferred Stock shall be the Common Stock of the Corporation as constituted on the date hereof.
In the event any shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted pursuant to Section 5 hereof, the shares
so converted shall be cancelled and shall not be reissued. The charter of this Corporation shall be
appropriately amended to effect the corresponding reduction in the Corporation’s authorized capital
stock.

7. Protective Provisions. So long as any shares of Preferred Stock are
outstanding, the Corporation shall not whether by direct action or by merger, consolidation or
otherwise without first obtaining the approval (by vote or written consent, as provided by law) of the
holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a
single class on an as-converted into Common Stock basis:

(i) amend, waive or repeal any provision of, or add any provision to, the
Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws;

(ii) increase or decrease (other than by conversion) the total number of
authorized shares of Common Stock or of any series of Preferred Stock;

(iii) authorize or issue (by reclassification or otherwise), or obligate itself
to issue, any other equity security (including any other security convertible into or exercisable for
any equity security) having a preference or priority over or ranking on parity with the Series B-1
Preferred Stock, SeriesC Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock,
Series F Preferred Stock or Series G Preferred Stock;

(iv) declare or pay dividends on any class or series of capital stock;

(v) purchase or otherwise acquire (or pay into or set funds aside for a
sinking fund for such purpose) any share or shares of Common Stock; provided, however, that this
restriction shall not apply to the repurchase of shares of Common Stock from employees, officers,
directors, consultants or other persons performing services for the Corporation pursuant to
agreements under which the Corporation has the option to repurchase such shares at cost or at cost
upon the occurrence of certain events, such as the termination of employment;

19
DOCSOC/1231076v4/016907-0019
(vi) (1) sell, lease, license on an exclusive basis or otherwise dispose of all
or substantially all of the asscts of the Corporation and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole;
(2) consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity, or permit any other corporation or
entity to consolidate or merge into the Corporation or enter into a plan of exchange with any other
corporation or entity, or otherwise acquire any other corporation or entity, or otherwise take any
action constituting or resulting in a recapitalization of the Corporation; or (3) effect any transaction
or series of transactions in which holders of the Corporation’s voting power prior to such transaction
or series of transactions will hold, on a post-transaction basis, less than a majority of the surviving
entity’s voting power.

(vii) increase or decrease the number of members that constitute a full
Board;
