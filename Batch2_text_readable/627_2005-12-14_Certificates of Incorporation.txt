distributed to holders of Series D Junior Stock, if any, other th:n Common Stock, and then

by such holders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any holder of a future class or series of the
Corporation’s capital stock is permitted to participate with Series D Junior Stock in the
distribution of any assets remaining after the holders of such class or series of capital stock (of
each series then outstanding) have been paid their liquidation preference, if any, then the holders
of the Series D-3 Preferred Stock shall also be permitted to participate in such distribution in
proportion to the number of shares of Common Stock, determined on an as-converted basis, held
by such holders. If upon occurrence of such event the asseis and property thus distributed among
the holders of the Series D-3 Preferred Stock and the Series D Parity Stock, if any, is insufficient
to permit the payment to such holders of the fiuil preferential amount, then the entire assets and
property of the Corporation legally available for distribution shall, subject to the prior payment
in full of distributions in respect of liquidation on shares of Series D Senior Stock, be distributed
ratably among the holders of the Series 2-3 Preferred Stock and the Series D Parity Stock, such

consultants, independent contractors, vendors, strategic partners or customers upon termination

right of said repurchase between the Corporation and such persons at the same price per share
such persons paid therefor.

Stock into that number of fully-paid and non-assessable shares cf Common Stock that is equal to
the Series D-3 Sales Price divided by the Series D-3 Conversion Price multiplied by the number
of shares of Series D-3 Preferred Stock to be converted. The “Series D-3 Conversion Price” for
the Series D-3 Preferred Stock shall initially be the Series D-3 Sales Price, and shal! be subject to
adjustment as provided herein. The number of shares of Common Stock into which each share

LA\1492661.2
of § rics D-3 Preferred Stock may be converted is hereinafter referred to as the “Series D-3
Conversion Rate.” ‘

(ii) | Mechanics of Conversion. Each holder of Series D-3
Preferred Stock that desires to convert such shares into shares of Common Stock pursuant to this
paragraph 5(a) shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office
of the Corporation or any transfer agent for the Series D-3 Preferred Stock, and shall give written
notice to the Corporation at such office that such holder elects to convert the same. Such notice
shall state the number of shares of Series D-3 Preferred Stock being converted. Thereupon, the
Corporation shall promptly issue and deliver at such office to such holder a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled. Such
conversion shall be deenied to have been made at the close of business on the date of such
surrender of the certificates representing the shares of Series D-3 Preferred Stock to be

Preferred Stock from time to time outstanding, and the Corporation shall obtain and kcep in force
such permits as may be required in order to enable the Corporation lawfully to issue and deliver
such number of shares of Common Stock. On conversion, no fractional shares of Common

determined by the Board in good faith.

b. Automatic Conversion.

exercise of such options or, in the case of convertible securities and options therefor, the
conversion or exchange of such convertible securities or exercise of such options, shall be

(d) upon the expiration of any such options or
any rights of conversion or exchange under such convertible securities which shall not
have been exercised, the Series D-3 Conversion Price, computed upon the original issue
thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto) and any subsequent
adjustments based thereon shall, upon such expiration, be recomputed as if:

i) in the case or convertible securities
or options for Common Stock, the only Additionai Shares of Common issued
were the shares of Common Stock, if any, actually issued upon the exercise of
such options or the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities and the
consideration received therefor was the consideration actually received by the
Corporation for the issue of such exercised options plus the consideration actually
received by the Corporation upon such exercise or for the issue of all such
convertible securities which were actually converted or exchanged, plus the
additional consideration, if any, actually received by the Corporatius upon such
conversion or exchange, and

il) in the case ‘f options for convertible
securities, only the convertible securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise
thereof were issued at the time of issue of such options, and the consideration
received by the Corporation for the Additional Shares of Common deemed to
have been then issued was the consideration actually received by the Corporation
for the issue of such exercised options, plus the consideration deemed to have
been received by the Corporation (determined pursuant to paragraph 5(c)(vii))
upon the issue of the convertible securities with respect to which such options
were actually exercised; and

of Additional Shares of Common. In the event the Corporation issues or is deemed to issue
Additional Shares of Common “ithout consideration or for consideration per share less than the
applicable Series D-3 Conversion Price in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such
issue, then and in such event, the Series D-3 Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently
with such issue (the “Series D-3 Weighted Average Antidilution’’), to a price (calculated to the
nearest cent) determined by multiplying the Series D-3 Conversion Price by a fraction, the

LA\I492661.2
numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
before such issue plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration
received by the Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of Common so issued
would purchase at such Series D-3 Conversion Price, and the denominator of which shall be the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number
of such Additional Shares of Common so issued; and provided further, that for the purposes of
this paragraph 5(c)(iv), all shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise, conversion or
exchange of outstanding opidons, preferred stock (including without limitation Series D-3
Preferred Stock and Series D Parity Stock) and other convertible securities, as the case may be,
shall be deemed to be outstanding, and immediately after any Additional Shares of Common are
deemed issucd, such Additional Shares of Common shall be deemed to be outstanding.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the holders of shares in a future class or series of the
Corporation’s capital stock have a conversion price adjustment upon the issuance of Additional
Shares of Common such that the conversion price applicable to such shares of capital stock is
equal to the quotient of the aggregate consideration received for the Additional Shares of
Common divided by the number of Additional Shares of Common (‘Ratchet Antidilution’’),
then the holders of Series D-3 Preferred Stock shall have the Series D-3 Conversion Price
adjusted for such Ratchet Antidilution rights as to any Additional! Shares of Common rather than
the Series D-3 Weighted Average Antidilution rights described above.

(v) Adjustments for Subdivisions, Splits Combinations
Consolidations, Reorganizations or Reclassifications of Common Stock. In the event that after

the date the Series D-3 Preferred Stock is originally issued the outstanding shares of Common
Stock shall be (a) subdivided or split into a greater number of shares of Common Stock,
(b) combined or consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of
Common Stock or (c) changed into a different number of shares of any other class or classes of
stock, whether by capital recrganization, reclassification or otherwise, the holders of the shares
of Series D-3 Preferred Stock shall receive upon conversion, the stock and/or securities to which
the holder would have been entitled had the holder held, at the time of said split, subdivision,
combination, consolidation, reorganization or reclassification, the number of shares of Common
Stock into which Series D-3 Preferred Stock could have converted immediately prior to such
event.

(vi) Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. In the

event the Corporation at any time after the datc of the first issuance of the Senes D-3 Preferred
Stock makes, or fixes a record date for, the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled
to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in the securities of the Corporation, then the
holders of the shares of Series D-3 Preferred Stock shal! receive upon conversion, in addition to
the number of sharcs of Common Stock receivable thereupon, the stock or securities to which the
holder would have been entitled had the holder held, at the time of said dividend or other
distribution, the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Series D-3 Preferred Stock
could have converted immediately prior to such event, and had such holders thereafter during the
period from the date of such event to and including the date of conversion, retained such stock or
securitics receivable by such holders as aforesaid during such period, subject to all other
adjustments called for during such period under this paragraph 5 with respect to the rights of the
holders of ‘1c Series D-3 Preferred Stock.

LA\492661.2

the aggregate amount of cash received by the Corporation excluding amounts paid
or payable for accrued interest or accrued dividends and prior to any commissions
or expenses paid by the Corporation;

(b) insofar as it consists of property other than
cash, be computed at the fair value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined
in good faith by the Board; and

(c) in the event Additional Shares of Common

exercise of such options or the conversion or exchange of such convertible
securities, or in the case of options for convertible securities, the exercise
of such options for convertible securities and the convirsion or exchange
of -uch convertible securities by

(y) | the maximum number of snares of Common

Subdivisions or Combinations of Common Stock. In the event the outstanding shares of
Common Stock shall be subdivided (by stock split, Common Stock dividend or otherwise), into a
greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Series D-3 Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such subdivision shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such
subdivision, be proportionately decreased. In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock
shall be combined (by reclassification or otherwise) into a lesser number of shares of Common
Stock, the Series D-3 Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such combination shall,
concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination, be proportionately increased.

(ix) Adjustments for Other Distributions. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time makes or fixes a record date for the determination

of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive any distribution (excluding any repurchases of
securities by the Corporation not made on a pro rata basis from all holders of any class of the
Corporation's securities) payable in property or in securities of the Corporation other than shares
of Common Stock and other than as otherwise adjusted in this paragraph 5, then and in each sch
event provision shall be made so that the holders of Series D-3 Preferred Stock shall receive
upon such distribution the amount of securities of the Corporation which they would have
received had their shares of Series D-3 Preferred Stock then been converted into Common Stock
on the date of such event and had they thereafter, during the period from the date of such event 'to
and including the date of conversion, retained such securities receivable by such holders as
aforesaid during such period, subject to all other adjustments called for during such period under
this paragraph 5 with respect to the rights of the holders of the Series D-3 Preferred Stock.

(x) Adjustments for _ Reclassification, Exchange _and
Substitution. If the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series D-3 Preferred Stock
shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of any other class or classes of
stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision
or combination of shares provided for above), the Series D-3 Conversion Price then in effect
shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such reorganization or reclassification, be
proportionately adjusted such that the Series D-3 Preferred Stock shall be convertible into, in lieu
of the number of shares of Common Stock which the holders would otherwise have been entitled
to receive, a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock equivalent to the number of
shares of Common Stock that would have been subject to receipt by the holders upon conversion
of Series D-3 Preferred Stock immediately before that exchange.

d. No Impairment. The Corporation will not, by amendment of its
Articles of Incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, merger, dissolution,
issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or
performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Corporation but
will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of al! the provisions of this paragraph 5
and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the
conversion rights of the holders of the Series D-3 Preferred Stock against impairment.

effect the conversion of all the then outstanding shares of Series D-3 Preferred Stock; and if at
any time the number of authorizea but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient
to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Series D-3 Preferred Stock, the
Corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to
increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall
be sufficient for such purpose.
