all shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion, exchange or exercise of any
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, Options or other Convertible Securities); and

(II) the denominator of which shall bc the sum of (X) the number of shares of Common

shares but including all shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion, exchange or
exercise of any outstanding shares of Serics A Preferred Stock, Options or other

dividend or similar adjustment (such excess being herein referred to as the “Excess
Authorized Shares”) at any time within eighteen (18) months of the Issuance Date
(unless such increase is a result of a stock dividend, combination, split, recapitalization,
reorganization or the like, which action has been approved by at least one of the Preferred
Directors).

(vi) Expiration of Change in Price. If the consideration per

share provided for in any Dilutive Convertible Security giving rise to an adjustment of
the Series A/A-] Preferred Conversion Price, or the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon the exercise, exchange or conversion of any such Dilutive Convertible
Security changes at any time, the Series A/A-] Preferred Conversion Price in effect at the
time of such change shall be readjusted to the Series A/A-1 Preferred Conversion Price
which would have been in effect at such time had such Dilutive Convertible Securities
provided for such changed consideration per share or changed number of shares
(determined as provided in Section E.1(iv) hereof) at the time initially granted, issucd or
sold; provided that such adjustment of such Series A/A-1 Preferred Conversion Price will
be made only as and to the extent that such Series A/A-1! Preferred Conversion Price
effective upon such adjustment remains not greater than the Series A/A-1 Preferred
Conversion Price that would be in effect if such Dilutive Convertible Securities had not

of such expiration or cancellation shall be readjusted to the Series A/A-1 Preferred
Conversion Price which would have been in effect had the expired or canceled Dilutive

outstanding shares of Series A-2 Preferred Stock, voting together as a separate class, will
be subject to adjustment from and the Issuance Date as follows:

(i) Dividends and Stock Splits. If, after the Issuance Date, the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding is increased (i) by a stock dividend
payablc in sharcs of Common Stock or (ii) by a subdivision or split-up of shares of
Common Stock without a comparable subdivision or split-up of the Series A-2 Preferred
Stock, then, on the date such payment is made or such change is effective, the Series A-2
Preferred Conversion Price shall be appropriately decreased so that the number of shares
of Common Stock issuable on conversion of the shares of Series A-2 Preferred Stock

. -12-
PALOALTO:43821.2
shall be increased in proportion to such increase of outstanding shares of Common Stock;
provided, however, that, in the case of clause (i) above, no such adjustment shall be made
to the Series A-2 Proferrcd Conversion Price if the holders of Series A-2 Preferred Stock
simultaneously receive (A) a dividend or other distribution of shares of Common Stock in
a number equal to the number of shares of Common Stock as they would have received if
all outstanding shares of Series A-2 Preferred Stock had been converted into Common
Stock on the date of such event or (B) a dividend or other distribution of sharcs of
Preferred Stock which are convertible, as of the date of such event, into such number of
shares of Common Stock as is equal to the number of additional shares of Common Stock
being issued with respect to each share of Common Stock in such dividend.

(ii) Reverse Stock Splits. Lf the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding at any time after the Issuance Date is decreased by a combination or
reverse split of the outstanding shares of Common Stock without a comparable
combination or reverse split of the Series A-2 Preferred Stock then, on the effective date
of such combination or reverse split, the Series A-2 Preferred Conversion Price shall be
appropriately increased so that the number of sharcs of Common Stock issuable on
conversion of the shares of Series A-2 Preferred Stock shall be decreased in proportion to
such decrease in outstanding shares of Common Stock.

(iii) Sale of Common Stock. Except as set forth in
Section E.2{v), in the event the Corporation shall at any time, or from time to time after
the Issuance Date, issue, sel] or exchange any sharcs of Common Stock (including shares
held in the Corporation’s treasury but excluding Excluded Shares and excluding any
shares of Common Stock actually issued upon the exercise of Options or upon the
conversion or exchange of Convertible Securities, in each case provided such issuance is
pursuant to the terms of such Option or Convertible Security) for a Common Purchase
Price less than the Series A-2 Preferred Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to
the issuance, sale or exchange of such shares (any such issuance, sale or exchange is
hereafter referred to as a “Series A-2 Dilutive Transaction”), then, concurrently with
such issue the Series A-2 Preferred Conversion Price shall forthwith be reduced to a price
per share equal to the Common Purchase Price.

The Series A-2 Preferred Conversion Price, as so adjusted, shall be
readjusted jn the same manner upon the happening of any successive Series A-2 Dilutive
Transaction.

{iv) ale of Options, Rights or Convertible Securities, Except
as set forth in Section E.2(v), in the event the Corporation shall at any time or from time
to time after the Issuance Date, issue Options or Convertible Securities (other than

by dividing (A) the total amount of consideration received or receivable by the
Corporation for the issuance of Dilutive Convertible Securities plus the minimum
amount, if any, set forth in the terms of such securities as payable to the Corporation
upon the exercise, exchange or conversion thereof by (B) the aggregate number of shares
of Common Stock that would be issued if all such Options or other Convertible Securities
were exercised, exchanged or converted immediately after the issuance thereof (whether

-13- ¢
PALOALTO:43821.2
or not such Options or other Convertible Securities are immediately exercisable,
exchangeable or converttble) (thc amount determined by the division of (A) and (B), the
“Series A-2 Dilutive Issuance Purchase Price”)) less than the Series A-2 Preferred
Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the issuance of the Dilutive Convertible
Securities, then, concurrently with such issue the Series A-2 Preferred Conversion Price
shall forthwith be reduced to a price per share equal to the Series A-2 Dilutive Issuance
Purchase Price.

(v) Preferred Stock Event. Upon the occurrence of a Preferred
Stock Event, the Series A-2 Preferred Conversion Price shall, in order to maintain the
fully-diluted ownership interest in the Corporation represented by the Series A-2
Preferred Stock immediately before such Preferred Stock Event, simultaneously with the
happening of such Preferred Stock Event, be adjusted by multiplying the Series A-2
Preferred Conversion Price by a fraction: (1) the numerator of which shall be the number
of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Preferred Stock Event
(excluding treasury shares but including all shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion, exchange or exercise of any outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, Options
or other Convertible Securities); and (II) the denominator of which shall be the sum of
(X) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such
Preferred Stock Event (excluding treasury shares but including all shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion, exchange or exercise of any outstanding shares of
Series A Preferred Stock, Options or othcr Convertible Securities) and (Y) the Excess
Authorized Shares.

The Series A-2 Preferred Conversion Price, as so adjusted, shall be
readjusted in the same manner upon the happening of any successive Preferred Stock
Event or Events; provided, that, no adjustment of the Series A-2 Preferred Conversion
Price shall be made under Section B.2(iii) or E.2(iv) if any adjustment to thc Series A-2
Preferred Conversion Price shall have been made in accordance with this Section E.2(v).

(vi) Expiration or Change in Price, If the consideration per
share provided for in any Dilutive Convertible Security giving rise to an adjustment of

the Series A-2 Preferred Conversion Price, or the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon the exercise, exchange or conversion of any such Dilutive Convertible
Security changes at any time, the Series A-2 Preferred Conversion Price in effect at the
time of such change shall be rcadjusted to the Series A-2 Preferred Conversion Price
which would have been in effect at such timc had such Dilutive Convertible Securities
provided for such changed consideration per share or changed number of shares
(determined as provided in Section E.2(iv) hereof) at the time initially granted, issued or
sold; provided that such adjustment of the Scries A-2 Preferred Conversion Price will be
made only as and to the extent that such Series A-2 Preferred Conversion Price effective
upon such adjustment remains not greater than the Series A-2 Preferred Conversion Price
that would be in effect if such Dilutive Convertible Securities had not resulted in any
adjustment of the Series A-2 Prefcrrcd Conversion Price at the time initially granted,
issued or sold or in connection with any intervening changes thereto. Except as
otherwise provided in this Section Z.2(vi), no further adjustment of the Series A-2
Preferred Conversion Price shall be made under this Section E upon the actual issuance

4:
PALOALTO:438212
of any shares of Common Stock which are issued pursuant to the exercise, conversion or
exchange of any Dihuative Convertible Securities if an adjustment shall previously have
been made upon the issuance of such Dilutive Convertible Securities in accordance with
Section E.2(iv). If, as, and when the rights to acquire shares of Common Stock upon
exercise, exchange or conversion of the Dilutive Convertible Securities which gave rise
to such adjustment expire or are canceled without having been exercised, the Series A-2
Preferred Conversion Price in effect at the time of such expiration or cancellation shall be
readjusted to the Series A-2 Preferred Conversion Price which would have been in effect
had the expired or canceled Dilutive Convertible Securities not been issued.

3. Other Adjustments. In the event the Corporation shall make or
issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Common Stock
entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the
Corporation other than shares of Common Stock and the provisions of Section B do not
apply to such dividend or other distribution, then and in each such event lawful and
adequate provision shall be made so that the holders of sharcs of Preferred Stock shail
receive, upon conversion thereof in addition to the number of shares of Common Stock
receivable thereupon, the number and type of securities of the Corporation which they
would have received had their shares of Preferred Stock been converted into Common
Stock on the date of such event and had they thereafter, during the period from the date of
such event to and including the date of conversion, retained such securities receivable by
them as aforesaid during such period, giving application to ali adjustments called for
during such period under this Section E as applied to such distributed securities;
provided, however, that no such provision shall be made if the holders of Preferred Stock
receive, simultaneously with the distribution to the holders of Common Stock, a dividend
or other distribution of such securities in an amount equal to the amount of such
securities as they would have received if all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock had
been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event.

4, Reorganization, etc. If the Common Stock issuable upon the
conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or different number of
shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by reclassification or otherwise (other
than a subdivision or combination of shares, a stock dividend or a reorganization, merger
or consolidation provided for clscwhere in this Scction E), then and in cach such cvent
the holder of each share of Preferred Stock shall have the right to receive upon
conversion of the Preferred Stock the kind and amount of shares of stock and other
securities and property receivable upon such reorganization, reclassification or other
change by holders of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of
Preferred Stock might have been converted immediately prior to such reorganization,
reclassification or change, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein.

5. Mergers and Other Reorganizations. Subject to Section C, if at
any time or from time to time there shall be a capital reorganization of the Common

converted or exchanged for stock, securities or other property, then, as part of and as a

. -15-
PALOALTO:43821.2
condition to the effectiveness of such reorganization, merger or consolidation, lawful and
adequate provision shall be made so that the holders of sharcs of Preferred Stock shall
thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of the Preferred Stock, as the case may
be, the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the Corporation or of
the successor corporation resulting from such reorganization, merger or consolidation to
which a holder of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion would have becn
entitled on such capital reorganization, merger or consolidation. In any such case,
appropriate provisions shall be made with respect to the rights of the holders of the shares
of Preferred Stock aftcr the rcorganization, merger or consolidation to the end that the
provisions of this Section (including, without limitation, provisions for adjustment of the
Series A/A-1 Preferred Conversion Price or Series A-2 Preferred Conversion Price, as the
casc may be, and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock)
shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as may bc, with respect to any shares of stock,
securities or assets to be deliverable thereafter upon the conversion of the Preferred
Stock.

6. Calculations. Solely for purposes of calculating the Series A/A-1
Preferred Conversion Value, Series A-2 Preferred Conversion Value, Series A/A-1
Preferred Conversion Price or Series A-2 Preferred Conversion Price or calculating the
number of shares of Common Stock into which one share of the Preferred Stock is
convertible and otherwise subject in all cases to Section D.3 hereof, all calculations under
this Section E shall be made to the nearest thousandth (1/1000th) of a cent or to the
nearest one hundredth (1/100th) of a share, as the case may be.

any time of any holder of shares of the applicable class of Preferred Stock furnish or
cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments
and readjustments, (ii) the Series A/A-1 Preferred Conversion Price or Series A-2
Preferred Conversion Price, as the case may be, before and after such adjustment or
readjustment, and (iii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of
other property which at the time would be reccived upon the conversion of such holder’s
shares of Preferred Stock.

Common Stock or any Options or Convertible Securities shall be computed at the fair
market value thereof, as determined in good faith by resolution of a majority of the Board
