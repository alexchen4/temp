4. Optional Conversion.

The holders of Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as follows (the “Conversion
Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert.

(i) Each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the
option of the holder thereof, at any time and from time to time, and without the payment of
additional consideration by the holder thereof, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable
shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing $0.144 by the Series A Conversion Price
(as defined below) in effect at the time of conversion. The ‘Series A Conversion Price”,
effective at the time of filing of this Certificate is $0.144. Such Series A Conversion Price, and
the rate at which shares of Series A Preferred Stock may be converted into shares of Common
Stock, shall be subject to adjustment as provided below; provided, however, that in no event
shall the Series A Conversion Price equal an amount less than the par value of the Common
Stock at the time of conversion.

(ii) —_ In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation, the Conversion Rights shall terminate at the close of business on the last full day
preceding the date fixed for the payment of any such amounts distributable on such event to the
holders of Series A Preferred Stock. In the event of such a redemption or liquidation, dissolution
or winding up, the Corporation shall provide to each holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock
notice of such redemption or liquidation, dissolution or winding up, which notice shall (i) be sent
at least 15 days prior to the termination of the Conversion Rights, and (ii) state the amount per
share of Series A Preferred Stock that will be paid or distributed on such redemption or
liquidation, dissolution or winding up, as the case may be.

(b) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued
upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the
holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction
multiplied by the then effective Series A Conversion Price.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion.

(i) In order for a holder of Preferred Stock to convert shares of
Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock. such holder shall surrender the certificate or
certificates for such shares of Preferred Stock, at the office of the transfer agent for the
applicable series of Preferred Stock (or at the principal office of the Corporation if the

BOS1575939.5 -6-
Corporation serves as its own transfer agent), together with written notice that such holder elects
to convert all or any number of the shares of Preferred Stock represented by such certificate or
certificates. Such notice shall state such holder’s name or, subject to any applicable transfer
restrictions, the names of the nominees in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates
for shares of Common Stock to be issued. If required by the Corporation, certificates
surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or
instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered
holder or his or its attorney duly authorized in writing. The date of receipt of such certificates
and notice by the transfer agent (or by the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own
transfer agent) shall be the conversion date (“Conversion Date’), and the shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of the shares represented by such certificate shall be deemed to
be outstanding of record as of such date. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after the
Conversion Date, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to his or
its permitted nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to
which such holder shall be entitled, together with cash in lieu of any fraction of a share.

(ii) The Corporation shall at all times when any Preferred Stock shall
be outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued stock, for the
purpose of effecting the conversion of the Preferred Stock, such number of its duly authorized
shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all
outstanding Preferred Stock.

(iii) | Upon any such conversion, no adjustment to the Series A
Conversion Price shall be made for any declared but unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred
Stock surrendered for conversion or on the Common Stock delivered upon conversion.

(iv) All shares of Preferred Stock which shall have been surrendered
for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights with
respect to such shares, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and to vote, shal]
immediately cease and terminate on the Conversion Date, except only the right of the holders
thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor and payment of any dividends
declared but unpaid thereon. Any shares of Preferred Stock so converted shall be retired and
cancelled and shall not be reissued, and the Corporation (without the need for stockholder action)
may from time to time take such appropriate action as may be necessary to reduce the authorized
number of shares of such series of Preferred Stock accordingly.

(v) The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and other similar taxes
that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon
conversion of shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4. The Corporation shall not,
however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in
the issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in which the
shares of Preferred Stock so converted were registered, and no such issuance or delivery shall be
made unless and until the person or entity requesting such issuance has paid to the Corporation

the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax
has been paid.

contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of
such Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities and Options therefor, the conversion or

Conversion Price as would have obtained had such revised terms been in effect upon the original
date of issuance of such Option or Convertible Security. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no

BOS1575939.5 -9-

Additional Shares of Common Stock other than such Option or Convertible Security between the
original adjustment date and such readjustment date.

(excluding Options or Convertible Securities which, upon exercise, conversion or exchange
thereof, would entitle the holder thereof to receive shares of Common Stock which are
specifically excepted from the definition of Additional Shares of Common Stock by Subsection
4(d)(i)(C) above), the issuance of which did not result in an adjustment to the Series A
Conversion Price pursuant to the terms of Subsection 4(d)(iv) below (either because the
consideration per share (determined pursuant to Subsection 4(d)(v) hereof) of the Additional
Shares of Common Stock subject thereto was equal to or greater than the Series A Conversion
Price then in effect or because such Option or Convertible Security was issued before any shares
of such series were outstanding), are revised (either automatically pursuant to the provisions
contained therein or as a result of an amendment to such terms) after the filing of this Certificate,
to provide for either (1) any increase in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
the exercise, conversion or exchange of any such Option or Convertible Security or (2) any
decrease in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion or
exchange, then such Option or Convertible Security, as so amended, and the Additional Shares

Option or unconverted or unexchanged Convertible Security which resulted (either upon its
original issuance or upon a revision of its terms) in an adjustment to the Series A Conversion
Price pursuant to the terms of Subsection 4(d)(iv) below, then the Series A Conversion Price
shall be readjusted to such Series A Conversion Price as would have been obtained had such
Option or Convertible Security never been issued.

(E) No adjustment in the Series A Conversion Price shal] be
made upon the issuance of shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities upon the exercise
of Options or the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon the conversion or exchange of
Convertible Securities.

Additional Shares of Common Stock issued in a Qualifying Public Offering) without
consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Series A Conversion Price, then the
Series A Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated
to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying the Series A Conversion Price by a fraction, (A)
the numerator of which shall be (1) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to such issue (treating for this purpose as outstanding all shares of Common
Stock issuable upon exercise of Options outstanding immediately prior to such issue or upon

BOS1575939.5 -10-
conversion or exchange of Convertible Securities (including the Series A Preferred Stock)
outstanding (assuming exercise of any outstanding Options therefor) immediately prior to such
issue) plus (2) the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration
received or to be received by the Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of
Common Stock so issued would purchase at the Series A Conversion Price; and (B) the
denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to such issue (treating for this purpose as outstanding all shares of Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of Options outstanding immediately prior to such issue or upon conversion or
exchange of Convertible Securities (including the Series A Preferred Stock) outstanding
(assuming exercise of any outstanding Options therefor) immediately prior to such issue) plus
the number of such Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this Subsection
4(d), the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional Shares of
Common Stock shall be computed as follows:

(A) | Cashand Property: Such consideration shall:

(1) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
aggregate amount of cash received by the
Corporation, excluding amounts paid or payable for
accrued interest;

(iI) _ insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair market value thereof at the
time of such issue, as determined in good faith by
the disinterested members of the Board of Directors
of the Corporation; and

(1H) in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock
are issued together with other shares or securities or
other assets of the Corporation for consideration
which covers both, be the proportion of such
consideration so received, computed as provided in
clauses (1) and (II) above, as determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

(B) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per
share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been
issued pursuant to Subsection 4(d)(iii), relating to Options and Convertible Securities, shall be
determined by dividing

the Corporation as consideration for the issue of
such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the
minimum aggregate amount of additional
consideration (as set forth in the instruments

BOS1575939.5 -ll-
relating thereto, without regard to any provision
contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of
such consideration) payable to the Corporation upon
the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the
case of Options for Convertible Securities, the
exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities
and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Secunities, by

without regard to any provision contained therein
for a subsequent adjustment of such number)
issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities.

more than one date Additional Shares of Common Stock which are comprised of shares of the
same series or class of Preferred Stock and which result in an adjustment to the Series A
Conversion Price pursuant to the terms of Subsection 4(d)(iv) above, and such issuance dates
occur within a period of no more than 120 days, then, upon the final such issuance, the
applicable Conversion Price shall be readjusted to give effect to all such issuances as if they
occurred on the date of the final such issuance (and without giving effect to any adjustments as a
result of such prior issuances within such period).

(e) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If the Corporation shall at
any time or from time to time on or after the filing of this Certificate effect a subdivision of the

outstanding Common Stock or combine the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock. the
Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately before that subdivision or combination shall be
proportionately decreased. If the Corporation shall at any time or from time to time on or after
the filing of this Certificate combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock or effect a
subdivision of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, the Series A Conversion Price
in effect immediately before the combination or subdivision shall be proportionately increased.
Any adjustment under this paragraph shall become effective at the close of business on the date
the subdivision or combination becomes effective.

(f) Adjustment for Certain Dividends and Distributions. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time on or after the filing of this Certificate shall make

or issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to
receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock, then and
in cach such event the Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately before such event shall
be decreased as of the time of such issuance or, in the event such a record date shall have been
fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, by multiplying the Series A Conversion
Price then in effect by a fraction:

BOS1575939.5 -12-
(1) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of
business on such record date, and

(2) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of
business on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of
such dividend or distribution;

provided, however, that if such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend is not
fully paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the Series A
Conversion Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record date
and thereafter the Series A Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this paragraph as of
the time of actual payment of such dividends or distributions; and provided further, however, that
no such adjustment shall be made with respect to the Series A Conversion Price if the holders of
Series A Preferred Stock simultaneously receive (i) a dividend or other distribution of shares of
Common Stock in a number equal to the number of shares of Common Stock as they would have
received if all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock had been converted into Common
Stock on the date of such event or (ii) a dividend or other distribution of shares of Series A
Preferred Stock which are convertible, as of the date of such event, into such number of shares of
Common Stock as is equal to the number of additional shares of Common Stock being issued
with respect to each share of Common Stock in such dividend or distribution.

(g) Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time on or after the filing of this Certificate shall make
or issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to
receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the Corporation (other than
shares of Common Stock) or in cash or other property, then and in each such event the holders of
Series A Preferred Stock shall receive, simultaneously with the distribution to the holders of
Common Stock, a dividend or other distribution of such securities, cash or other property in an
amount equal to the amount of such securities, cash or other property as they would have
received if all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock had been converted into Common
Stock on the date of such event.

(h) Adjustment for Merger or Reorganization, etc. Subject to the provisions
of Subsection 2(d), if there shall occur any reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
consolidation or merger involving the Corporation in which the Common Stock (but not the
Series A Preferred Stock) is converted into or exchanged for securities, cash or other property
(other than a transaction covered by paragraphs (e), (f) or (g) of this Section 4), then, following
any such reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger, each share of
Series A Preferred Stock shall be convertible into the kind and amount of securities, cash or
other property which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation
issuable upon conversion of one share of Series A Preferred Stock immediately prior to such
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger would have been
entitled to receive pursuant to such transaction; and, in such case, appropriate adjustment (as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation) shall be made in the
application of the provisions in this Section 4 with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of

BOS 1575939.5 -13-
the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock to the end that the provisions set forth in this Section
4 (including provisions with respect to changes in and other adjustments of the Series A
Conversion Price) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to
any securities or other property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of the Series A
Preferred Stock.

(i) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Series A Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation at its
expense shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable but in any event not later than 20 days
thereafter, compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and
furnish to each holder of Series A Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or
readjustment (including the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property into which the
Series A Preferred Stock is convertible) and showing in detail the facts upon which such
adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the written request at any time of any holder of Series A Preferred Stock (but in
any event not later than 10 days thereafter), furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a
certificate setting forth (i) the Series A Conversion Price then in effect, and (ii) the number of
shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other securities, cash or property which then
would be received upon the conversion of Series A Preferred Stock.

(j) Notice of Record Date. In the event:

(i) the Corporation shall take a record of the holders of its Common
Stock (or other stock or securities at the time issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred
Stock) for the purpose of entitling or enabling them to receive any dividend or other distribution,
or to receive any right to subscribe for or purchase any shares of stock of any class or any other
securities, or to receive any other right; or

(11) of any capital reorganization of the Corporation, any
reclassification of the Common Stock of the Corporation, any consolidation or merger of the
Corporation with or into another corporation (other than a consolidation or merger in which the
Corporation is the surviving entity and its Common Stock is not converted into or exchanged for

any other securities or property), or any transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Corporation; or

(iii) | of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-
up of the Corporation,

then, and in each such case, the Corporation will send or cause to be sent to the holders of
Preferred Stock a notice specifying, as the case may be, (i) the record date for such dividend,
distribution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right, or (ii)
the effective date on which such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer,
dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is to take place, and the time, if any is to be fixed, as of
which the holders of record of Common Stock (or such other stock or securities at the time
issuable upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock) shall be entitled to exchange their
shares of Common Stock (or such other stock or securities) for securities or other property
deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer,

BOS1575939.5 -14-
dissolution, liquidation or winding-up. Such notice shall be sent at least 10 days prior to the
record date or effective date for the event specified in such notice. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the failure to send such a notice shall not invalidate the corporate action to which such
notice relates.

S. Mandatory Conversion.

(a) Upon the earlier of (A) the closing of the sale of shares of Common Stock
in a firm-commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, resulting in at least $15,000,000 of proceeds to the
Corporation, net of the underwriting discount and commissions (a “Qualifying Public Offering’),
or (B) a date agreed to in writing by the holders of shares of Preferred Stock representing at least
two-thirds of the votes represented by the then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock
(each, a ‘Mandatory Conversion Date’’), all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall
automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock, at the then effective conversion rate.

(b) All holders of record of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be given
written notice of the Mandatory Conversion Date and the place designated for mandatory
conversion of all such shares of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 5. Such notice
need not be given in advance of the occurrence of the Mandatory Conversion Date. Such notice
shall be sent by first class or registered mail, postage prepaid, or given by electronic
communication in compliance with the provisions of the DGCL, to each record holder of Series
A Preferred Stock. Upon receipt of such notice, each holder of shares of Series A Preferred
Stock shall surrender his or its certificate or certificates for all such shares to the Corporation at
the place designated in such notice. On the Mandatory Conversion Date, all outstanding shares
of Series A Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have been converted into shares of Common
Stock, which shall be deemed to be outstanding of record, and all rights with respect to the Series
A Preferred Stock so converted, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and vote (other
than as a holder of Common Stock), will terminate, except only the rights of the holders thereof,
upon surrender of their certificate or certificates therefor, to receive certificates for the number of
shares of Common Stock into which such Series A Preferred Stock has been converted, and
payment of any declared but unpaid dividends thereon. If so required by the Corporation,
certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by written instrument
or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the
registered holder or by his or its attorney duly authorized in writing. As soon as practicable after
the Mandatory Conversion Date and the surrender of the certificate or certificates for Series A
Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall cause to be issued and delivered to such holder, or on his
or its written order, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock
issuable on such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof and cash as provided in
Subsection 4(b) in respect of any fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon
such conversion.

(c) All certificates evidencing shares of Series A Preferred Stock which are
required to be surrendered for conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof shall, from
and after the Mandatory Conversion Date, be deemed to have been retired and cancelled and the
shares of Series A Preferred Stock represented thereby converted into Common Stock for all
purposes, notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender such

BOS 1575939.5 -15-
certificates on or prior to such date. Such converted Series A Preferred Stock may not be
reissued, and the Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate action (without the need for
stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Series A
Preferred Stock accordingly.

6. Special Mandatory Conversion.

(a) Trigger Event, In the event that any holder of shares of Series A Preferred
Stock does not participate in a Qualified Financing (as defined below) by purchasing in the
aggregate, in such Qualified Financing and within the time period specified by the Corporation
(provided that the Corporation has sent to each holder of Series A Preferred Stock at least ten
(10) days written notice of, and the opportunity to purchase its Pro Rata Amount (as defined
below) of, the Qualified Financing), such holder’s Pro Rata Amount, then each share of Series A
Preferred Stock held by such holder shall automatically, and without any further action on the
part of such holder, be converted into shares of Common Stock at the Series A Conversion Price
in effect immediately prior to the consummation of such Qualified Financing, effective upon,
subject to, and concurrently with, the consummation of the Qualified Financing. For purposes of
determining the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock owned by a holder, and for
determining the number of Offered Securities (as defined below) a holder of Series A Preferred
Stock has purchased in a Qualified Financing, all shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by
Affiliates (as defined below) of such holder shall be aggregated with such holder’s shares and all
Offered Securities purchased by Affiliates of such holder shall be aggregated with the Offered
Securities purchased by such holder (provided that no shares or securities shall be attributed to
more than one entity or person within any such group of affiliated entities or persons). Such
conversion is referred to as a “Special Mandatory Conversion’’.

(b) Procedural Requirements. Upon a Special Mandatory Conversion, each
holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock converted pursuant to Subsection 6(a) shall
surrender his, her or its certificate or certificates for all such shares (or, if such holder alleges that
such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement
reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that
may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such
certificate) to the Corporation at the place designated in such notice, and shall thereafter receive
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to this Section 6. All nghts with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock converted pursuant to
Subsection 6(a), including the rights, if any, to receive notices and vote (other than as a holder of
Common Stock), will terminate, except only the rights of the holders thereof, upon surrender of
their certificate or certificates therefor (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement), to receive the
items provided for in the last sentence of this Subsection 6(a). If so required by the Corporation,
certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by written instrument
or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the
registered holder or by his, her or its attorney duly authorized in writing. As soon as practicable
after the Special Mandatory Conversion and the surrender of the certificate or certificates (or lost
certificate affidavit and agreement) for Series A Preferred Stock so converted, the Corporation
shall issue and deliver to such holder, or to his, her or its nominees, a certificate or certificates
for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable on such conversion in accordance with
the provisions hereof, together with cash as provided in Subsection 4(c)(i) in lieu of any fraction

BOS 1575939.5 - 16-
of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion and the payment of any
declared but unpaid dividends.

(c) Effect of Special Mandatory Conversion. All shares of Series A Preferred
Stock shall, from and after the time of the Special Mandatory Conversion, no longer be deemed
to be outstanding and, notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender
the certificates for such shares on or prior to such time, all nghts with respect to such shares shall
immediately cease and terminate at the time of the Special Mandatory Conversion, except only
the right of the holders thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor and to
receive payment of any dividends declared but unpaid thereon. Such converted Series A
Preferred Stock shall be retired and cancelled and may not be reissued as shares of such series,
and the Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate action (without the need for
stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Series A
Preferred Stock accordingly.

(d) Definitions. For purposes of this Section 6, the following definitions shall
apply:
