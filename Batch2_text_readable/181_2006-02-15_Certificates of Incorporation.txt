The rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions granted to and imposed on the Scries A
Preferred Stock are as set forth below in this Article IV(B).

Subject to compliance with applicable protective voting rights which have been or may be
granted to the Preferred Stock or series thereof in Certificates of Designations or the
Corporation’s Certificate of Incorporation, including, without limitation, Section 6 hereof,
(“Protective Provisions”), but notwithstanding any other rights of the Preferred Stock or any
series thereof, the rights, privileges, preferences and restrictions of any such additional series may
be subordinated to, pari passu with (including, without limitation, inclusion in provisions with
respect to liquidation and acquisition preferences, redemption and/or approval of matters by voze
or written consent), or senior to any of those of any present or future class or series of Preferred
or Common Steck. Subject to compliance with applicable Protective Provisions, the Board of
Directors is also authorized to increase or decrease the number of shares of any series (other than
the Series A Preferred Stock), prior or subsequent to the issue of that scrics, but not below the
number of shares of such series then outstanding. In case the number of shares of any series shall
be so decreased, the shares constituting such decrease shall resume the status which they had
prior tc the adoption of the resolution originally fixing the number of shares of such series.

1. Dividend Provisions. Dividends of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be
payable only when, as, and if declared by the Board of Directors out of assets legally available
therefor. Subject to the rights of serics of Preferred Stock which may from time-to-time come
into existence, any dividends declared by the Board of Directors or paid by the Corporation shall
be distributed among the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and Common Stock pro rata based
on the number of shares of Common Stock then held by each holder (assuming conversion of all
such Preferred Stock into Common Stock). No tight shall accrue to holders of shares of Series A
Prefered Stock by reason of the fact that dividends on said shares are not declared in any prior
year, nor shall any undeclared or unpaid dividend bear or accrue any interest.

2. Liquidation.

of the Corporation to the holders of Common Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, an
amount per share equal to 510.4553 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends,
reclassification and the like) for each share of Series A Preferred Stock then held by them, plus
declared but unpaid dividends (the “Liquidation Preference”). If upon the occurrence of such
eyent, the assets and funds thus distributed among the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock
shall be insufficient tc permit the payment to such holders of the full aforesaid preferential
amounts, then, subject to the rights of scrics of Preferred Stock that may from time-to-time come
into existence, the entire assets and funds of the Corporation legally available for distribution
shal) te distribated ratably among the helders of the Series A Preferred Stock in proportion to the
preferential amount cach such holder is otherwise entitled to receive. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the Liquidation Preference is less than the amount the holders of the Series A
Preferred Stock would have received as holders of Common Stock if all outstanding shares of

Series A Preferred Stock had been converted in‘o shares of Common Stock immediately prior to
such liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, then in lieu of the Liquidation Preference, the
holders of Series A Preferred Stock shal! be entitled (regardless of whether or not such Series A
Preferred Stock is actually converted to Common Stock) to receive an amount per share equal to
the amcunt per share such holders would have seceived as holders of Common Stock if all
outstanding shares of Series A Pregerred Stock had been converted into shares of Common Stock
immediately prior to such liquidation, dissolution or winding-up.

(b) Remaining Assets, Upon the completion of the distribution
required dy Section 2(a) above ard any other distribution that may be required with respect to

other corporation, limited liability company or other entity (other than a wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Corporation) or (B) upon the closing of the transfer (whether by merger, consolidation or
otherwise), in one transaction or series of related transactions, to a person or group of affiliated
persons (other than an underwriter of the Corporation’s securities), of the Corporation’s
securities if, after such closing, such person or group of affiliated persons would hold 50% or
more of the outstanding voting stock of the Corporation (or the surviving or acquiring entity)
(any such transaction, a “Liquidation Transectior”), provided that none of the following shall be
considered a Liquidation Transaction: (i) a merger effected exclusively for the purpose of
changing the domicile of the Corporation, or (ii) a transaction in which the stockholders of the
Corporation immediately prior to the transaction own 50% or more of the voting power of the
surviving corporation following the transaction. The treatment of any particular transaction or

(3) = If there is no active public market, the value
shall be the fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors

(B) The method of valuation of securities subject to
investment letter or other restrictions on free merketability (other than restrictions arising solely
by virtue of a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an

to reflect the approximate fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board cf
Directors (including one of the directors elected solely by the holders of the Series A Preferred
Stock).

calculating the Series A Redemption Price, the term “IRR” shall be calculated using the
following formula:

IRR = (FV/PV}""-1, where
“FY” equals the cash amount of the Series A Redemption Price;

“PV” equals $10.4553 (as adjusted for stock splits. stock
dividends, reclassification and the like); and

“n” equals the quotient of (A) the number of days from the Purchase Date

of issuance of such share and in any event on or prior to the fifth day prior to the Preferred Stock
Redemption Date, if any, as may have been fixed in any Redemption Date Notice with respect to
such share of Series A Preferred Stock, at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for

62/15/2606 87:23 8666826296 csc PAGE

(c) Mechanics of Canversion. Before any holder of Series A
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert such Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock,
the holder shal! surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the
Corporation or of any transfer agent for such series of Preferred Stock, and shall give written
notice to the Corporation at its principal corporate office, of the election to convert the same and
shall state therein the name or names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of
Common Stock are to be issued. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafler, issuc
and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or nominees of
such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such
holder shell be entitled as aforesaid. Such conversion shall be decmed to have been made
immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of such
series of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares
of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record
holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock as of such date. If the conversion is in
connection with an underwritten public offering of securities registered pursuant to the Securities
Act the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering such Preferred Stock for
conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of securities
pursuant to such offering, in which event any persons entitled 10 receive Common Stock upon
conversion of such Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock
until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities.

(4) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock for Certain
Dilutive Issuances, Splits and Combinations. The Conversion Price of the Series A Preferred
Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

(i) Issuance of Additional Stock below Purchase Price. If
the Corporation should issue, at any time after the date upon which any shares of Series A

Preferred Stock were first issued (the “Purchase Date” with respect to such series), any
Additional Stock (as defined below} without consideration or for a consideration per share less
than the Conversion Price for such series in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such
Additional Stock, the Conversion Price for such series in effect iramediately prior to each such
issuance shall automatically be adjusted as szt forth in this Section 4(d)(i), unless otherwise
provided in this Section 4(d)(i).

(A) Adjustment Formula. Whenever the Conversion
Price is adjusted pursuant to this Section (4)(d)(i), the new Conversion Price shal] be determined
by multiplying the Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction, (x) the numerator of which shall
be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance (the
“Outstanding Common”) plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate
consideration received by the Corporation for such issuance would purchase at such Conversion
Price; and (y) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Outstanding Common
plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock. For purposes of the foregoing calculation,
the term “Outstanding Common” shall include shares of Common Stock deemed issued pursuant
to Section 4(d)G)(E) below.

of any Common Stock Equivalents (the consideration in each case to be determined in the
manner provided in Section 4(d}{i)(D).

(2) In the event of any change in the number of

only the number of shares of Common Stock (and Common Stock Equivalents that remain

4(d)(i) shall have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price above the Conversion Price in
effect immediately prior to such adjustment.

(ii) Stock Splits and Dividends. In the event the Corporation
should at any time after the Purchase Date fix a record date for the cffectuation of a split or
subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or the determination of holders of
Common Stock entitled to recetve a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of
Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents without payment of any consideration by such
holder for the additional shares of Common Stock or the Common Siock Equivalents (:ncluding

such record date (or the date of such dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no record date
is fixed), the Conversion Price of each of the Seties A Preferred Stock shall be appropriately
decreased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of
such series shall be increased in proportion to such increase of the aggregate of shares of
Common Stock outstanding and those issuable with respect to such Common Stock Equivalents
with the number of shares issuable with respect to Common Stock Equivalents determined from
time to time in the manner provided for deemed issuances in Section 4(d)@(€).

(iii) Reverse Stock Splits. Ifthe number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding at any time after the Purchase Date is decreased by a combination of the
