privileges, and restrictions granted to and imposed on the Preferred Stock are as set forth below in

l. Dividend Provisions.

(a) The holders of shares of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive
dividends, on a pari passu basis, out of any assets legally available therefor, prior and in preference to
any declaration or payment of any dividend (payable other than in Common Stock or other securities
and rights convertible into or entitling the holder thereof to receive, directly or indirectly, additional
shares of Common Stock of this Corporation) on the Common Stock of this Corporation, at the rate of
$0.08 per share per annum for the Series A Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock
dividends, combinations, recapitalizations or the like (collectively, "Recapitalizations")), payable
when, as, and if declared by the Board of Directors. Such dividends shall not be cumulative. Any
partial payment shall be made ratably among the holders of Preferred Stock in proportion to the
payment each such holder would receive if the full amount of such dividends were paid.

After payment of any dividends pursuant to Section JV(B)(1)(a), any
additional dividends shall be distributed among all holders of Common Stock and all holders of
Preferred Stock in proportion to the number of shares of Common Stock which would be held by
each such holder if all shares of such series of Preferred Stock were converted to Common Stock at
the then effective conversion rate for each such series of Preferred Stock.

(c) As authorized by Section 402.5(c) of the California Corporations
Code, each holder of an outstanding share of Preferred Stock shall have deemed to have consented,
for purposes of Sections 502 and 503 of the California Corporations Code, to distributions made by
the Corporation in connection with (i) repurchases of Common Stock issued to or held by
employees, officers, directors or consultants of this Corporation or its subsidiaries upon termination

(ii) other repurchases from employees, officers, directors or consultants at the then deemed fair
market value of the Common Stock, and (iii) repurchases of Common Stock pursuant to rights of
first refusal contained in agreements providing for such rights (any repurchase under subsections (i),

2. Liquidation Preference.

(a) In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of this
Corporation, either voluntary or involuntary, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled
to receive, prior and in preference to any distribution of any of the assets of this Corporation to the
holders of Common Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount per share equal to the
sum of (A) $1.00 (the "Original Series A Issue Price") for each outstanding share of Series A
Preferred Stock (subject to adjustment for Recapitalizations) and (B) an amount equal to all declared

-2-

CANrPortbINPALIB2\CL1N3720277_6.DOC
but unpaid dividends on such share. If upon the occurrence of such event, the assets and funds
available for distribution among the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to
permit the payment to such holders of the full aforesaid preferential amounts, then the entire assets
and funds of this Corporation legally available for distribution to stockholders shall be distributed
ratably among the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock in proportion to the full preferential
amount each such holder is otherwise entitled to receive under this Section IV(B)(2)(a).

(b) Upon completion of the distributions required by Section IV(B)(2)(a),
all of the remaining assets of this Corporation available for distribution to stockholders shall be
distributed among the holders of the Preferred Stock and Common Stock pro rata based on the
number of shares of Common Stock held by each (assuming full conversion of all such Preferred
Stock); provided, however, that at such time as the distribution of liquidation preferences with
respect to shares of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to Sections 1V(B)(2)(a) and IV(B)(2)(b) shall
equal three (3) times the Original Series A Issue Price (subject to adjustment for Recapitalizations),
_ then no further distribution pursuant to this Section IV(B)(2)(a) shall be made with respect to shares

of Series A Preferred Stock.

(c) After payment has been made to the holders of Preferred Stock and
Common Stock pursuant to Sections [V(B)(2)(a) and IV(B)(2)(b), all of the remaining assets of this
Corporation available for distribution to stockholders shall be distributed among the holders of
Common Stock pro rata based on the number of shares of Common Stock held by each.

(d) For purposes herein, a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of this
Corporation shall be deemed to be occasioned by, or to include (unless the holders of at least a
majority of the voting power of the Preferred Stock then outstanding shal] determine otherwise),
(A) the acquisition of this Corporation by another entity by means of any reorganization, merger or
_ consolidation (but excluding any reorganization, merger or consolidation effected exclusively for the
purpose of changing the domicile of the Corporation), or any transaction or series of related
transactions in which the Corporation's stockholders of record as constituted immediately prior to
such transaction or series of related transactions will, immediately after such transaction or series of
related transactions (by virtue of securities issued in such transaction or series of related
transactions) fail to hold at least 50% of the voting stock of the resulting or surviving corporation
following such transaction or series of related transactions; or (B) a sale of all or substantially all of
the assets of this Corporation; provided, however, that the issuance and sale of the Series A Preferred
Stock under that certain Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement between the Corporation and
certain purchasers of the Series A Preferred Stock, dated on or about February 10, 2005 (as
amended, the "Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement") shall not be deemed to be a
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of this Corporation; or (C) the grant by the Corporation of an
exclusive license of all or substantially all of the Corporation's intellectual property. In any of such
events, if the consideration received by this Corporation is other than cash, its value will be deemed
its fair market value as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of this Corporation;
provided, however, that any securities shall be valued as follows:

(i) The value of securities not subject to investment letter or other
similar restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of a
stockholder's status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be:

-3-
C:ANrPortbNPALIB2\CL13720277_6.DOC
(A)  iftraded on a securities exchange or through the
Nasdaq National Market, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the
securities on such exchange or system over the thirty (30) day period (or portion thereof) ending
three (3) days prior to the closing;

(B) _ if actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the thirty
(30) day period (or portion thereof) ending three (3) days prior to the closing; and

(C) _ if there is no active public market, the value shall be the
fair market value thereof, as determined by the Board of Directors of this Corporation and approved
by the holders of a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock.

(ii) | The method of valuation of securities subject to investment
letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of a
stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount from
the value determined as above in Section IV(B)(2)(d)(i) to reflect the approximate fair market value
thereof, as mutually determined by the Board of Directors of this Corporation and approved by the
holders of a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock.

(iii) In the event the requirements of this Section IV(B)(2)(d) are
not complied with, this Corporation shall forthwith either:

(A) cause such closing to be postponed until such time as
the requirements of this Section IV(B)(2)(d) have been complied with; or

(B) cancel such transaction, in which event the rights,
preferences, and privileges of the holders of the Preferred Stock shall revert to and be the same as
such rights, preferences and privileges existing immediately prior to the date of the first notice

referred to in Section IV(B)(2)(d){iv) hereof.

(iv) | This Corporation shall give each holder of record of Preferred
Stock written notice of such impending transaction not later than twenty (20) days prior to the
stockholders’ meeting called to approve such transaction, or twenty (20) days prior to the closing of
such transaction, whichever is earlier, and shall also notify such holders in writing of the final
approval of such transaction. The first of such notices shall describe the material terms and
conditions of the impending transaction, and this Corporation shall thereafter give such holders
prompt notice of any material changes to such material terms and conditions. The transaction shall
in no event take place sooner than twenty (20) days after this Corporation has given the first notice
provided for herein or sooner than ten (10) days after this Corporation has given notice of any
material changes provided for herein; provided, however, that such periods may be shortened upon
the written consent of the holders of Preferred Stock that are entitled to such notice rights or similar

‘notice rights and that represent at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares
of such Preferred Stock.

3. Redemption.

(a) Subject to the rights of Preferred Stock which may from time to time
come into existence, after the receipt by this Corporation of a written request from the holders of not
less than a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock that all shares of
Series A Preferred Stock be redeemed (a "Redemption Request"), and concurrently with the
surrender by such holders of the certificates representing such shares, this Corporation shall, to the
extent it may lawfully do so and to the extent requested in writing in a Redemption Request, redeem
all of the then outstanding and unconverted shares of Series A Preferred Stock by paying in cash in
three (3) equal annual installments (the date of each of such installments, a "Preferred Stock
Redemption Date"), in exchange for the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed, a sum
equal to the Original Series A Issue Price per share of Series A Preferred Stock (subject to
- adjustment for any Recapitalizations) plus all declared but unpaid dividends on such shares (the
"Preferred Stock Redemption Price"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the first Preferred Stock
Redemption Date shall be the later of the fifth (5") anniversary of the Purchase Date (as defined
below) applicable to the Series A Preferred Stock (the "Series A Purchase Date") or the date ninety
(90) days after the receipt by this Corporation of the Redemption Request, (ii) the second and third
Preferred Stock Redemption Dates shall occur on each anniversary of such first Preferred Stock
Redemption Date, (iii) no Redemption Request may be delivered to the Company earlier than the
date ninety (90) days before the fifth (5") anniversary of the Series A Purchase Date, and (iv) the
Corporation shall not be obligated to redeem any shares of Series A Preferred Stock that have been
redeemed or converted prior to the applicable Preferred Stock Redemption Date. Any redemption
effected pursuant to this Section IV(B)(3)(a) shall be made on a pro rata basis among the holders of
the Series A Preferred Stock in proportion to the number of shares of Preferred Stock then held by
such holders.

(b)  Asused in this Section IV(B)(3)(b) and in Sections [V(B)(3)(c) and
IV(B)(3)(d) below, the term "Redemption Date" shall refer to each "Preferred Stock Redemption
Date” and the term "Redemption Price" shall refer to each "Preferred Stock Redemption Price." At
least fifteen (15) but no more than thirty (30) days prior to a Redemption Date, written notice shall
be mailed, first class postage prepaid, to each holder of record (at the close of business on the
business day next preceding the day on which notice is given) of the series of Preferred Stock to be
redeemed and each other series of outstanding Preferred Stock having redemption rights under this
Section TV(B)(3), at the address last shown on-the records of this Corporation for such holder,
(i) notifying such holder of the redemption to be effected on the applicable Redemption Date,
specifying the number of shares to be redeemed from such holder, the Redemption Date, the
Redemption Price, the place at which payment may be obtained and calling upon such holder to
surrender to this Corporation, in the manner and at the place designated, his, her or its certificate or
certificates representing the shares to be redeemed and (ii) instructing any holder not already
participating in such redemption of its rights, subject to the requirements of this Section IV(B)(3), as
applicable, to participate in such redemption (the "Redemption Notice"). In no event shall any
redemption of any series of Preferred Stock be effected prior to the last date on which each other
series of Preferred Stock may also be redeemed as specified in the Redemption Notice. Except as
provided in Section IV(B)(3)(c), on or after a Redemption Date, each holder of Preferred Stock to be
redeemed on such Redemption Date shall surrender to this Corporation the certificate or certificates
representing such shares, in the manner and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice, and

5.
CANrPortbKPALIB2\CLN3720277_6.D0C
thereupon the applicable Redemption Price of such shares shall be payable to the order of the person
whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof and each surrendered
certificate shall be cancelled. In the event that less than all the shares represented by any such
certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares. No
transfers of Preferred Stock shall be permitted during the five (5) day period prior to and including
any Preferred Stock Redemption Date, and this Corporation shall not recognize any such prohibited
transfer on its books and records.

(c) From and after each Redemption Date, unless there shall have been a
default in payment of the applicable Redemption Price, all rights of the holders of shares of the
series of Preferred Stock designated for redemption on such Redemption Date in the Redemption
Notice (except the right to receive the applicable Redemption Price without interest upon surrender
of their certificate or certificates) shall cease with respect to such shares, and such shares shall not
thereafter be transferred on the books of this Corporation or be deemed to be outstanding for any
purpose whatsoever. If the funds of this Corporation legally available for redemption of shares of
Preferred Stock on a Redemption Date are insufficient to redeem the total number of such shares of
Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such date, those funds that are legally available will be used to
redeem the maximum possible number of such shares ratably among the holders of such shares to be
redeemed such that each holder of a share of a particular series of Preferred Stock receives the same
percentage of the applicable Redemption Price for each share of such series. The shares of Preferred
Stock not redeemed shall remain outstanding and entitled to all the rights and preferences provided
herein. At any time thereafter when additional funds of this Corporation are legally available for the
redemption of shares of Preferred Stock, within ten (10) business days such funds will be used to
redeem the balance of the shares that this Corporation has become obli gated to redeem on any
Redemption Date but that it has not redeemed.

(d) Onor prior to each Redemption Date, this Corporation shall deposit
the Redemption Price of all shares of Preferred Stock designated for redemption in the Redemption
Notice, and not yet redeemed or converted, with a bank or trust corporation having aggregate capital
and surplus in excess of $100,000,000 as a trust fund for the benefit of the respective holders of the
shares designated for redemption and not yet redeemed, with irrevocable instructions and authority
to the bank or trust corporation to publish the notice of redemption thereof and pay the Redemption
Price for such shares to their respective holders on or after the Redemption Date, upon receipt of
notification from the Corporation that such holder has surrendered his, her or its share certificate to
the Corporation pursuant to Section [V(B)(3)(b). As of the date of such deposit (even if prior to the
Redemption Date), the deposit shall constitute full payment of the shares to their holders, and from
and after the date of the deposit the shares so called for redemption shall be redeemed and shall be
deemed to be no longer outstanding, and the holders thereof shall cease to be stockholders with
respect to such shares and shall have no rights with respect thereto except the rights to receive from
the bank or trust corporation payment of the Redemption Price of the shares, without interest, upon
surrender of their certificates therefor, and the right to convert such shares as provided in
Section TV(B)(4) hereof. Such instructions shall also provide that any moneys deposited by the
Corporation pursuant to this Section IV(B)(3)(d) for the redemption of shares thereafter converted
into shares of the Corporation's Common Stock pursuant to Section IV(B)(4) hereof prior to the
Redemption Date shal] be returned to the Corporation forthwith upon such conversion. The balance
of any moneys deposited by this Corporation pursuant to this Section IV(B)(3)(d) remaining

-6-

CANrPortbNPALIB2\CLN3720277_6.DOC
unclaimed at the expiration of six (6) months following the Redemption Date shall thereafter be
returned to this Corporation upon its request expressed by a resolution of its Board of Directors.

4, Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights
as follows (the "Conversion Rights"):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible,
at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share on or prior to
five (5) business days prior to the Redemption Date, if any, as may have been fixed in any
Redemption Notice with respect to such shares, at the office of this Corporation or any transfer agent
for such stock, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is
determined by dividing the Original Issue Price for each such series of Preferred Stock by the
"Conversion Price” applicable to such share, determined as hereafter provided, in effect on the date
the certificate is surrendered for conversion. The initial Conversion Price per share for shares of
Series A Preferred Stock shall be the Original Series A Issue Price; provided, however, that the
Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in
Section [V(B)(4)(d).

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall
automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Price at the time in
effect for such series of Preferred Stock immediately upon the earlier of (i) except as provided in
Section IV(B)(4)(c), this Corporation's sale of its Common Stock in the first underwritten public
offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the "Act"), covering the offer and sale of Common Stock (other than a registration on Form S-8,
Form S-4 or comparable or successor forms), the public offering price of which is not less than five
(5) times the Original Issue Price per share (as adjusted for any Recapitalizations) and with gross
proceeds to the Company of at least $50,000,000 or (ii) the date specified by written consent or
agreement of the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding shares of the Series A —
Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class.

(c) © Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall
be entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock, he, she or it shall surrender the
certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the principal corporate office of this Corporation
or of any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to this Corporation at
its principal corporate office, of the election to convert the same and shall state therein the name or
names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued (except
that no such written notice of election to convert shall be necessary in the event of an automatic
conversion pursuant to Section TV(B)(4)(b)). This Corporation shall, as soon as practicable
thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or
nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to
which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been
made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of
Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common
Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders
of such shares of Common Stock as of such date. Upon the occurrence of either of the events
specified in Section [V(B)(4)(b) above, the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted

-7-
C:\NrPortbhPALIB2\CL13720277_6.DOC
automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the
certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent;
provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion unless the certificates evidencing such
shares of Preferred Stock are either delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent as provided
above, or the holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost,
stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the
Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the conversion is in connection with an underwritten offering of securities registered
pursuant to the Act, the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering Preferred Stock for
conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant
to such offering, in which event the persons entitled to receive the Common Stock upon conversion
of the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately
prior to the closing or such sale of securities.

(d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock.

| (i) |The Conversion Price of each series of the Preferred Stock
shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

(A) _ If this Corporation shall issue, after the date upon which
any shares of a particular series of Preferred Stock were first issued (each, the "Purchase Date"
applicable to such series of Preferred Stock), any Additional Stock (as defined below) without
consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Conversion Price for such series of
Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock, the Conversion
Price for such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall
forthwith (except as otherwise provided in this Section IV(B)(4)(d)(i)) be adjusted to a price
determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the »
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding and deemed issued pursuant to
Section IV(B)(4)(d)(i)(E) immediately prior to such issuance, plus the number of shares of Common
Stock that the aggregate consideration received by this Corporation for such issuance would
purchase at such Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance; and the denominator
of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding and deemed issued pursuant to
Section TV(B)(4)(i)(E) immediately prior to such issuance, plus the number of shares of such
Additional Stock so issued.

(B) No adjustment of the Conversion Price for any series of
Preferred Stock shall be made in an amount less than one cent per share, provided that any
adjustments that are not required to be made by reason of this sentence shall be carried forward and
shall be either taken into account in any subsequent adjustment made prior to three (3) years from
the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward, or shall be made at the end
of three (3) years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward.
Except to the limited extent provided for in Sections IV(B)(4)(d)(i)(E)(3) and IV(B)(4)(d) (DEA),
no adjustment of such Conversion Price pursuant to this Section IV(B)(4\(d)(i) shall have the effect
of increasing the Conversion Price above the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such
adjustment. No adjustment of the Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock shall be made

-8-
C:ANrPortbNPALIB2\CLN3720277_6.DOC
with respect to the issuance of Additional Stock unless the consideration per shares for such
Additional Stock issued or deemed to be issued by the Corporation is less than the applicable
Conversion Price in effect on the date of, and immediately prior to, such issue.

(C) Inthe case of the issuance of Additional Stock for cash,
the consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting any
_ reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by this Corporation
for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

(D) Inthe case of the issuance of the Additional Stock for a
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be deemed
to be the fair value thereof as determined by the Board of Directors irrespective of any accounting
treatment. In the case of the issuance of the Additional Stock together with other shares or securities
or other assets of the Corporation for consideration which covers both, the consideration for the
Additional Stock shall be deemed to be the proportion of such total consideration so received for the
Additional Stock and other shares, securities or assets, computed as provided in
Section IV(B)(4)(d)(i)(C) and the preceding sentence of this Section IV(B\(4)(MG as

determined by the Board of Directors.

(BE) In the case of the issuance (whether before, on or after
the applicable Purchase Date) of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common Stock,
securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock or options to purchase
or rights to subscribe for such convertible or exchangeable securities, the following provisions shall

apply for all purposes of this Section IV(B)(4)(d)(i) and Section IV(B)(4)(d) (ai):

(1) The aggregate maximum number of shares (as
set forth in the instrument relating thereto without regard to any provisions contained therein for a
subsequent adjustment of such number) of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such options to
purchase or rights to subscribe for Common Stock shall be deemed to have been issued at the time
such options or rights were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration (determined in
the manner provided in Sections IV(B)(4)(d)(i)(C) and IV(B)(4)(d)(i)(D)), if any, received by this
Corporation upon the issuance of such options or rights plus the minimum aggregate amount of
additional consideration (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto without taking into account
any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration) payable to the
Corporation upon the exercise of such options or rights for the Common Stock covered thereby.

(2) The aggregate maximum number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of, or in exchange for any such convertible or
exchangeable securities or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such
convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof shall be
deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or such options or rights were
issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration (to be determined in the manner provided in
Sections [V(B)(4)(d)(G)(C) and IV(B)(4)(d)(i)(D)), if any, received by this Corporation for the |
issuance of such securities and related options or rights (excluding any cash received on account of
accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional
consideration (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto without taking into account any

-9-
C:ANrPortbNPALIB2\CLN3720277_6.DOC
provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration), if any, to be received
by this Corporation upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or the exercise of any related
options or rights.

(3) In the event of any change in the number of
shares of Common Stock issuable or in the consideration payable to this Corporation upon exercise
of such options or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such convertible or exchangeable
securities, including, but not limited to, a change resulting from the antidilution provisions thereof
(other than under or by reason of provisions designed to protect against dilution), the Conversion
Price of each series of Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such
options, rights or securities, shall be recomputed to reflect such change, but no further adjustment
shall be made for the actual issuance of Common Stock or any payment of such consideration upon
the exercise of any such options or rights or the conversion or exchange of such securities.

(4) | Upon the expiration of any such options or
rights, the termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options or
rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Conversion Price of each series of
Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, rights or
securities or options or rights related to such securities, shall be recomputed to reflect the issuance of
only the number of shares of Common Stock (and convertible or exchangeable securities that remain
in effect) actually issued upon the exercise of such options or rights, upon the conversion or
exchange of such securities or upon the exercise of the options or rights related to such securities.

(5) The number of shares of Common Stock
deemed issued and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to Sections IV(B)(4)(d)(G)(E)(1)
and IV(B)(4)(d)(i)(E\(2) shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or
expiration of the type described in either Section IV(B)(4)(d)(i)(E)(3) or IVIB)\(4\(0G 4).

(ii) "Additional Stock" shall mean any shares of Common Stock

issued (or deemed to have been issued pursuant to Section IV(B)(4)(d)G)\(E)) by this Corporation
after the applicable Purchase Date other than:

(A) — shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to a
transaction described in Section IV(B)(4)(d)(iii) hereof;

(B) shares of Common Stock issued or deemed issued to
employees, consultants, officers, directors or vendors (if in transactions with primarily non-financing
purposes) of this Corporation pursuant to a stock option plan or restricted stock purchase plan
approved by the Board of Directors (any such shares, the "Plan Carve-Out Shares"), so long as the
sum of the number of shares of Common Stock issued or deemed to have been issued directly after
the applicable Purchase Date and the number of shares of Common Stock issued or deemed to have
been issued pursuant to all such stock option plans or restricted stock purchase plans (whether issued
or deemed to have been issued before or after the applicable Purchase Date), does not exceed an
aggregate of 8,250,525 shares (appropriately adjusted for Recapitalizations and not including shares

been entitled on such recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the

who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend) or other distribution, any right

securities or property, or to receive any other right, this Corporation shall mail to each holder of

shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common
Stocks solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of Preferred Stock, such
numbers of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized
but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then

opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock

engaging in commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any
necessary amendment to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement) have been met, and (b) any holder of shares of
Series A-1 Preferred shall fail to purchase in the Milestone Closing all of the shares of Series A-2
Preferred that such holder has committed to purchase under the Series A Preferred Stock Purchase
Agreement, then all of such holder's shares of Series A-1 Preferred purchased in the Second Tranche
Closing (as defined in the Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement) shall automatically and
without further action on the part of such holder be converted effective upon, subject to, and
concurrently with, the consummation of the Milestone Closing into such number of fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Original Issue Price for
such Series A-1 Preferred by the Conversion Price applicable to such shares, determined as herein
provided, in effect on the date the Milestone Closing shall occur (the provisions set forth in this
sentence to be deemed the "Pay-to-Play"). Upon conversion pursuant to this Section IV(B)(4)(1)(i),

certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock to be issued and such
holder shall be deemed to have become a stockholder of record of Common Stock on the date of the
Milestone Closing unless the transfer books of this Corporation are closed on that date, in which
event he, she or it shall be deemed to have become a stockholder of record of Common Stock on the
next succeeding date on which the transfer books are open. In the event that the holder of any shares
of Series A-1 Preferred converted pursuant to this Section IV(B)(4)(1) fails to surrender for
conversion any certificates for the Series A-1 Preferred being converted into Common Stock
hereunder, at and after the time of such conversion, the shares of Series A-1 Preferred evidenced
thereby shall be deemed to be no longer outstanding, and all rights with respect thereto shall
forthwith cease and terminate, except only the rights of the holder (i) to receive certificates for the
