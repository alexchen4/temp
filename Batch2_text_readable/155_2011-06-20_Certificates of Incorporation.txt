CERTIFICATE OF AMENDMENT = SRV 110740164 - 3455237 FILE
TO
AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION
OF
ACUFOCUS, INC.

AcuFocus, Inc., a corporation organized and existing under and by virtue of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “Corporation”), DOES HEREBY CERTIFY:

That the amendment to the Corporation’s Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation set forth in the following resolution was approved by the Corporation’s Board of
Directors and stockholders and was fully adopted in accordance with the provisions of
Sections 228 and 242 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware:

RESOLVED, that Article FOURTH of the Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation of the Corporation be amended and restated by deleting paragraphs (d) and (e) of
Section B.6 in their entirety and replacing them with the following:

(d) Each share of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series
B-1 Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock and Series E
Preferred Stock (the “Affected Preferred Stock”) held by a Non-Participating Holder
shall, effective immediately prior to the Mandatory Closing Deadline of a Mandatory
Financing, automatically be converted into one-tenth (1/10") of a share of Common
Stock. For the purposes of this provision, (i) a “Mandatory Financing” means a financing
in which the Corporation seeks to raise at least $4,000,000 from the holders of the
Affected Preferred Stock through the issuance of unsecured convertible promissory notes
during a period beginning on a date after May 1, 2011, specified by the Corporation and
ending on a date before July 15, 2011, specified by the Corporation; (ii) the “Mandatory
Closing Deadline” means the date and time specified by the Corporation with respect to a
Mandatory Financing by which holders of shares of Affected Preferred Stock must invest
their Pro Rata Amount in order not to be deemed Non-Participating Holders; (iii) the “Pro
Rata Amount” of a holder of shares of Affected Preferred Stock means the product of the
total amount the Corporation seeks to raise from holders of Affected Preferred Stock in
the Mandatory Financing times a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares
of Affected Preferred Stock held by the holder and the denominator of which is the
number of shares of Affected Preferred Stock then outstanding; and (iv) “Non-
Participating Holder” means a holder of shares of Affected Preferred Stock that does not
invest at least such holder’s Pro Rata Amount in the Mandatory Financing on or before
the Mandatory Closing Deadline. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued
upon conversion of Affected Preferred Stock under this provision. In lieu of any
fractional shares to which a Non-Participating Holder would otherwise be entitled, the
Corporation shall pay to such holder an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the
fair market value of the Common Stock as determined in good faith by the Corporation’s
Board of Directors. Following any automatic conversion pursuant to this paragraph (d),
the holders of certificates representing shares of Affected Preferred Stock converted into
Common Stock shal] tender such certificates to the Corporation, and the Corporation

W02-WEST:3LSY 1\403634307.1
shall issue in exchange therefor certificates for the shares of Common Stock into which
such shares have been converted. All certificates evidencing shares of Affected Preferred
Stock which are required to be surrendered in accordance with the preceding sentence
shall, from and after the Mandatory Closing Deadline, be deemed to have been retired
and cancelled and the shares of Affected Preferred Stock represented thereby converted
into Common Stock for all purposes, notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders
thereof to surrender such certificates.

(ec) The right of holders of shares of Affected Preferred Stock to convert
shares of Affected Preferred Stock into Common Stock pursuant to Section B.5, above, is
suspended between the effective date of this paragraph (e) and the earlier of July 15, 2011
and the Mandatory Closing Deadline of a Mandatory Financing.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, AcuFocus, Inc. has caused this certificate to be signed by its

duly authorized President this 20th day of June, 2011.
