2(e), 2(f), 2(g) and 2(h) above, the remaining assets of the Corporation available for distribution
to stockholders, if any, shall be distributed among the holders of Series A-B Preferred Stock,
Series F Preferred Stock and Common Stock to each such holder in proportion to its pro rata
share of the sum of (1) the shares of Common Stock then outstanding, (2) the shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of the shares of Series A-B Preferred Stock then outstanding and
(3) the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the shares of Series F Preferred
Stock then outstanding (the “Series F Liquidation Conversion Shares”), except that, if the
entire assets and funds of the Corporation legally available for distribution upon a Liquidation
exceed $500,000,000, then with respect to any distribution of the portion of such assets and
funds in excess of $500,000,000 pursuant to this Section 2(i), for purposes of determining the pro
rata allocation of such distribution to the holders of Series F Preferred Stock the definition of
“Series F Liquidation Conversion Shares” as set forth above shall be deemed to be 1.2
multiplied by the shares of Common Stock which such holder would otherwise have the right to
acquire upon conversion of the shares of Series F Preferred Stock. Notwithstanding the
foregoing but subject to subsection 2(j), (1) if a Liquidation is consummated within 18 months
from August 21, 2008, then the total per share distribution to holders of Series F Preferred Stock
pursuant to this Section 2 of this Division B of this Article IV shall not exceed 1.5 multiplied by
the Series F Purchase Price; and (2) if a Liquidation is consummated after the 18 month
anniversary of August 21, 2008, then the total per share distribution to holders of Series F
Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 2 of this Division B of this Article IV shall not exceed
2.0 multiplied by the Series F Purchase Price.

NSD‘109062.1
(j) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in the last sentence of subsection
2(i), the holders of the Series F Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive upon a Liquidation, a
per share distribution equal to the greater of (X) the total per share distribution to holders of
Series F Preferred Stock pursuant to Subsection 2(a) and Subsection 2(i) or (Y) the amount that
the holders of Series F Preferred Stock would be entitled to receive in the Liquidation upon the
conversion of the shares of Series F Preferred Stock then outstanding to shares of Common
Stock.

(k) For purposes of this Section 2 of this Division B of this Article IV, any
acquisition of the Corporation by means of a merger or other form of corporate reorganization
(excluding any transaction effected for the purpose of changing the domicile of the Corporation),
or a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, or sale of securities
representing at least a majority of the voting or economic power of all securities of the
Corporation, unless the Corporation is the surviving corporation and the Corporation’s
stockholders of record as constituted immediately prior to such acquisition or sale (by virtue of
securities issued as consideration for the Corporation’s acquisition or sale or otherwise) hold at
least 50% of the voting power in the same relative proportions of the successor to the
Corporation’s business (any such acquisition or sale being hereinafter referred to as an
“Acquisition”), shall be treated as a Liquidation. The Corporation shall notify each holder of
Preferred Stock in writing of any pending Acquisition not less than 10 days prior to the
consummation thereof. Such notice shall describe the material terms and conditions of the
Acquisition (including without limitation, the amount and nature of the total consideration to be
paid in connection therewith). Upon the closing of any Acquisition, the holders of Preferred

follows:

(i) For securities not subject to investment letter or other similar
restrictions on free marketability:

(1) If traded on a securities exchange, the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange over the 30 day
period ending three days prior to the closing;

(2) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing bid and asked prices over the 30 day period ending three
days prior to the closing;

(3) If there is no active public market, the value shall be the

fair market value thereof as determined in good faith by the Board; and

-10-

NSDAI09062.1
(ii) The value of securities subject to investment letter or other
restrictions on free marketability and the value of all other noncash property shall be
appropriately discounted as determined in good faith by the Board; and

(iii) If the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding shares
of Senior Preferred Stock or the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding shares of
Scries B-6 Preferred Stock shall object to the determination by the Board of the value of
securities or noncash property under this subsection 2(1) of this Division B of this Article IV,
the Corporation shall engage at its own cost a nationally recognized investment bank mutually
selected by the Board and such holders to determine the value thereof and the determination of
such investment bank shall be conclusive.

this Article IV.

(b) Automatic Conversion.

(i) Each share of Series A-B Preferred Stock shall automatically be
converted into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock
determined by dividing the Original Issue Price for such series of Series A-B Preferred Stock
by the then-effective Conversion Price for such series of Series A-B Preferred Stock
immediately upon the closing of the sale of the Corporation’s Common Stock in a firm
commitment, underwritten public offering registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the “Securities Act”), where (x) the market capitalization of the Corporation, based
on the initial offering price per share in such offering (but excluding the shares sold by the
Corporation in such offering), is at least $125,000,000, (y) after such public offering, the shares
are listed on a United States national securities exchange and (z) the Corporation receives gross
proceeds of at least $25,000,000 (before payment of any underwriter discounts and
commissions and offering expenses) (a “Qualified IPO”).

(i1) Any conversion pursuant to this subsection 4(b) of this Division
B of this Article IV shall be effected without any action by the holder of such series of Series
A-B Preferred Stock and whether or not certificates representing such shares are surrendered to
the Corporation or any transfer agent for such Series A-B Preferred Stock.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Series A-B Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender
the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of this Corporation or of any
transfer agent for the Corporation’s capital stock, and shall give wnitten notice to this
Corporation at its principal corporate office, of the election to convert the same and shall state
therein the name or names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock are
to be issued. This Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such
office to such holder of Series A-B Preferred Stock or to the nominee or nominees of such
holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such

-12-

NSD\109062.1
holder shall be entitled as aforesaid. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made
immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Series A-
B Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record
holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock as of such date. If the conversion is in
connection with an underwritten offering of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act,
the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering Serics A-B Preferred Stock for
conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of securities
pursuant to such offering, in which event the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock
upon conversion of the Series A-B Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such
Series A-B Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities.

(d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Series A-B Preferred Stock for Certain |
Dilutive Issuances, Splits and Combinations. The Conversion Price of the Series A-B Preferred
Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

(i) (A) If the Corporation shall issue after 4:00 p.m., Eastern time,
on the date of original filing of this Restated Certificate with the Delaware Secretary of State
(the “Effective Time”), any Additional Stock (as defined below) without consideration or for a
consideration per share less than the Conversion Price for a series of Series A-B Preferred
Stock in effect immediatcly prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock, the Conversion
Price for such series in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall forthwith (except
as otherwise provided in this clause (i)) be adjusted to a price determined by multiplying such
Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares of
Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for such issuance
would purchase at such Conversion Price; and the denominator of which shall be the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of
shares of such Additional Stock. For purposes of the foregoing computation, the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding shall be deemed to include all shares of Common Stock
actually outstanding and all shares of Common Stock deemed to be outstanding as a result of
the application of subsection 4(d)(i)(E) of this Division B of this Article IV. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in connection with the issuance of any Additional Stock (except, in connection
with antidilution adjustments to the other series of Series A-B Preferred Stock, which shall be
governed by the first sentence of this subsection 4(d)(i)(A) of this Division B of this Article
IV) without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the then applicable
Conversion Price of the Series B-6 Preferred Stock, the Conversion Price of the Series B-6
Preferred Stock shall be lowered to be equal to the consideration per share received by the
Corporation for such issuance. Except as to the Series B-2 Preferred Stock and the Series A-6
Preferred Stock, the provisions of this subsection 4(d)(i) of this Division B of this Article IV
may be waived in any instance upon the written agreement by the holders of at least a majority
of the then outstanding shares of Senior Preferred Stock and the holders of at least a majority
of the then outstanding shares of Series B-6 Preferred Stock.

(B) No adjustment of the Conversion Price for the Series A-B

Preferred Stock shall be made in an amount less than one cent per share, provided that any

adjustments which are not required to be made by reason of this sentence shall be carried
-13-

NSDy109062.)
forward and shall be either taken into account in any subsequent adjustment made prior to three
years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward, or shall be
made at the end of three (3) years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being
carried forward. Except to the limited extent provided for in subsections 4(d)(i)(E)(3) and (E)(4)
of this Division B of this Article IV, no adjustment of such Conversion Price pursuant to this
subsection 4(d)(i) of this Division B of Article IV shall have the effect of increasing the
Conversion Price for the Series A-B Preferred Stock above the Conversion Price for the
applicable scries of Series A-B Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such adjustment.

(C) In the case of the issuance of Common Stock for cash, the
consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting any
reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by this
Corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

(D) In the case of the issuance of the Common Stock for a
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be
deemed to be the fair market value thereof as determined by the Board, without regard to the
accounting treatment thereof; provided that if the holders of at least a majority of the then
outstanding shares of Senior Preferred Stock or the holders of at least a majority of the then
outstanding shares of Series B-6 Preferred Stock shall object to such determination, the
Corporation shall engage at its own cost a nationally recognized investment bank mutually
selected by the Board and such holders to determine the value thereof and the determination of
such investment bank shall be conclusive.

(E) In the case of the issuance (whether before, on or after the
Effective Time) of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common Stock, securities by
their terms convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock or options to purchase or rights
to subscribe for such convertible or exchangeable securities, the following provisions shall apply
for all purposes of this subsection 4(d)(i) and subsection 4(d)(ii) of this Division B of this Article
IV:

(1) The aggregate maximum number of shares of Common
Stock deliverable upon exercise (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to exercisability,
including without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account potential
antidilution adjustments) of such options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common Stock
shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such options or rights were issued and for a
consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in subsections
4(d)(i)(C) and (d)(i)(D) of this Division B of this Article [V), if any, received by the Corporation
upon the issuance of such options or rights plus the minimum exercise price provided in such
options or rights (without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) for the Common
Stock covered thereby.

(2) The aggregate maximum number of shares of Common
Stock deliverable upon conversion of or in exchange (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions
to convertibility or exchangeability, including, without limitation, the passage of time, but
without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) for any such convertible or
exchangeable securities or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for

-14-

NSD\109062.!
such convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof shall
be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or such options or rights
were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration, if any, received by the
Corporation for any such securities and related options or rights (excluding any cash received on
account of accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the minimum additional consideration, if
any, to be received by the Corporation (without taking into account potential antidilution
adjustments) upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or the exercise of any related
options or rights (the consideration in each case to be determined in the manner provided in
subsections 4(d)(i)(C) and (d)(i)(D) of this Division B of this Article IV).

(3) In the event of any change in the number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon exercise of
such options or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such convertible or exchangeable
securities, including, but not limited to, a change resulting from the antidilution provisions
thereof, the Conversion Price of the Series A-B Preferred Stock to the extent in any way affected
by or computed using such options, rights or securities, shall be recomputed to reflect such
change, but no further adjustment shall be made for the actual issuance of Common Stock or any
payment of such consideration upon the exercise of any such options or rights or the conversion
or exchange of such securities.

(4) Upon the expiration of any such options or rights, the
termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options or rights
related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Conversion Price for the Series A-B
Preferred Stock to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, rights or
securities or options or rights related to such securities, shall be recomputed to reflect the
issuance of only the number of shares of Common Stock (and convertible or exchangeable
securities which remain in effect) actually issued upon the exercise of such options or rights,
upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or upon the exercise of the options or rights
related to such securities.

(5) The number of shares of Common Stock deemed issued
and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to subsections 4(d)(i)(E)(1) and (2) of this
Division B of this Article IV shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or
expiration of the type described in cither subsection 4(d)(i)(E)(3) or (4) of this Division B of this
Article IV.

(ii) “Additional Stock” shall mean any shares of Common Stock
issued (or deemed to have been issued pursuant to subsection 4(d)(i)(E) of this Division B of
this Article IV) by the Corporation on or after the Effective Time other than:

(1) | Common Stock issued pursuant to a transaction described
in subsection 4(d)(iii) of this Division B of this Article IV,

(2) Shares of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents
(as defined below) issuable or issued after the Effective Time to officers, employees, agents,
consultants, or directors (if in transactions with primarily non-financing purposes) of the
Corporation directly or pursuant to a stock option plan or agreement or restricted stock plan or

-15-
NSD1109062.1
agreement approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the
Corporation; provided that if the total number of shares reserved under such plans or agreements
exceeds 12.739,178 (plus any evergreen increases that take place after the Effective Time and
which were previously approved by the Corporation’s stockholders), as adjusted for any stock
dividend, stock split, recapitalization or the like, the holders of at least a majority of the then
outstanding shares of Series B-6 Preferred Stock and the Senior Preferred Stock shall be required
to consent to any increase under such plans or agreements,

(3) Shares of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents
issued after the Effective Time in connection with a bona fide lease transaction or bank financing
approved by the Board of Directors;

(4) — Shares of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents
issued to persons or entities with which the Corporation has a potential or existing customer,
independent contractor, consultancy, supplier or other strategic relationship, so long as such
issuance is approved by the Board of Directors,

(5) Shares of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents
issued in connection with a bona fide business acquisition of or by the Corporation, whether by
merger, consolidation, sale of assets, sale or exchange of stock or otherwise,

(6) Shares of Common Stock issued or issuable in a public
offering in connection with which all outstanding shares of Series A-B Preferred Stock will be
converted to Common Stock,

(7) Shares of Common Stock issued or issuable in connection
with the conversion of shares of Series A-B Preferred Stock into Common Stock; provided that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Conversion Price of the Series B-6 Preferred Stock shall be
subject to adjustment under subsection 4(d) of this Division B of this Article IV due to
adjustments (whether through antidilution or otherwise) made to the Conversion Prices or the
number of shares issuable upon conversion of any other series of Series A-B Preferred Stock, or

(8) Up to 150,000 shares of Common Stock or Common Stock
Equivalents issuable or issued to a lender pursuant to a warrant.

(iii) In the event the Corporation should at any time or from time to
time after the Effective Time fix a record date for the effectuation of a split or subdivision of
the outstanding shares of Common Stock or the determination of holders of Common Stock
entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of Common
Stock or other securities or rights convertible into, or entitling the holder thereof to receive
directly or indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock (hereinafter referred to as “(Common
Stock Equivalents”) without payment of any consideration by such holder for the additional
shares of Common Stock or the Common Stock Equivalents (including the additional shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof), then, as of such record date (or
the date of such dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no record date is fixed), the
Conversion Price of each series of Series A-B Preferred Stock as the case may be, shall be
appropriately decreased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion

-16-
NSD1109062.1
of each share of each series shall be increased in proportion to such increase of the aggregate of
shares of Common Stock outstanding and those issuable with respect to such Common Stock
Equivalents with the number of shares issuable with respect to Common Stock Equivalents
determined from time to time in the manner provided for deemed issuances in subsection
4(d)(i)(E) of this Division B of this Article IV.

(iv) If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any
time after the Effective Time is decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock, to the extent that such series of Series A-B Preferred Stock has not been
similarly combined, then, following the record date of such combination, the Conversion Price
of each series of Series A-B Preferred Stock, as the case may be, shall be appropriately
increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share
of each series shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares.

(e) Other Distributions. In the event the Corporation shal! declare a distribution
payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by the Corporation or
other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred to in subsection
4(d)(iii) of this Division B of this Article IV, then, in each such case for the purpose of this
subsection 4(e) of this Division B of this Article IV, the holders of Series A-B Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any such distribution as though they were the holders
of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation into which their shares of Series
A-B Preferred Stock are convertible as of the record date fixed for the determination of the
holders of Common Stock of the Corporation entitled to receive such distribution.

(f) Recapitalizations. If at any time or from time to time there shall be a
recapitalization of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision, combination or merger or sale
of assets transaction provided for elsewhere in this Section 4 or Section 2 of this Division B of
this Article IV) provision shall be made so that the holders of the Series A-B Preferred Stock
shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of each series of Series A-B Preferred
Stock, as the case may be, the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the
Corporation or otherwise, to which a holder of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion
would have been entitled on such recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall
be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 4 of this Division B of this Article [V
with respect to the rights of the holders of the Series A-B Preferred Stock after the
recapitalization to the end that the provisions of this Section 4 of this Division B of this Article
IV (including adjustment of the Conversion Price of each series of Series A-B Preferred Stock
then in effect and the number of shares purchasable upon conversion of any series of Series A-B
Preferred Stock, as the case may be) shall be applicable after that event as nearly equivalent as
may be practicable.

(g) No Impairment. This Corporation will not, by amendment of this Restated
Certificate or through any reorganization, recapitalization, transfer of assets, consolidation,
merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to
avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder
by this Corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the
provisions of this Section 4 of this Division B of this Article [V and in the taking of all such

-17-
NSDi109062.1
action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holders
of the Series A-B Preferred Stock against impairment.

(h) No Fractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments.

(i) No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon
conversion of the Series A-B Preferred Stock. All shares of Common Stock (including
fractions thereof) issuable upon conversion of more than one share of the Series A-B Preferred
Stock by a holder thereof shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the
conversion would result in the issuance of any fractional share. If, after the aforementioned
aggregation, the conversion would result in the issuance of any fractional share, the
Corporation shall, in lieu of issuing any fractional share, pay cash equal to the product of such
fraction multiplied by the fair market value of one share of Common Stock (as determined by
the Board) on the date of conversion.

(ii) Within fifteen (15) days following the occurrence of each
adjustment or readjustment of the Conversion Price for a series of Series A-B Preferred
pursuant to this Section 4 of this Division B of this Article IV, the Corporation, at its expense,
shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof
and prepare and furnish to each holder of Series A-B Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth
such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or
readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any
holder of Series A-B Preferred Stock furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like
certificate setting forth (A) such adjustment and readjustment, (B) the Conversion Price for the
applicable series of Series A-B Preferred Stock, as the case may be, at the time in effect, and
(C) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at
the time would be received upon the conversion of a share of the applicable series of Series A-
B Preferred Stock, as the case may be.

(i) Notices of Record Date. In the event of any taking by the Corporation of a
record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof
who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend) or other distribution, any
right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of stock of any class or any other
securities or property, or to receive any other right, the Corporation shall mail to each holder of
Series A-B Preferred Stock at least ten days prior to the date specified therein, a notice
specifying the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend,
distribution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right.

(j) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at all
times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock,
solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of Series A-B Preferred Stock
such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding shares of Series A-B Preferred Stock and if at any time the number
of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Series A-B Preferred Stock in addition to such
other remedies as shall be available to the holder of such Series A-B Preferred Stock, the
Corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to

-18-
NSD1109062.1
increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall
be sufficient for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in its best efforts to
obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to this Restated
Certificate.

(k) Notices. Any notice required or permitted by the provisions of this Section 4

Notwithstanding, the foregoing, holders of Series F Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to vote
such shares in the election of directors of the Corporation until (i) the expiration or early
termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the ‘“HSR_ Act”) such that such holder could, in
compliance with the HSR Act, acquire a number of shares of Series F Preferred Stock with the
right to vote for directors of the Corporation equal to the number of shares of Series F Preferred
Stock without the right to vote for directors of the Corporation held by such holder or (ii) any
other event, the occurrence of which results in such holder’s ability to acquire, in compliance
with the HSR Act, a number of shares of Series F Preferred Stock with the right to vote for
directors of the Corporation equal to the number of shares of Series F Preferred Stock without
the right to vote for directors of the Corporation held by such holder. For the avoidance of
doubt, holders of Series F Preferred Stock shall not have voting rights with respect to the election
of directors, except as expressly provided herein or as required by law. Fractional votes shall
not, however, be permitted and any fractional voting rights available on an as-converted basis
(after aggregating all shares into which shares of Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred
Stock, Series E Preferred Stock and Series F Preferred Stock held by each holder could be
converted) shall be rounded to the nearest whole number (with onc-half being rounded upward).

5. Status of Converted or Redeemed Stock. In the event any shares of Series
C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock or Series F Preferred Stock
shall be redeemed pursuant to Section 2 of this Division B of this Article IV or converted
pursuant to subsection 4(a) of Division B of this Article IV or Section 3 of this Division B of this
Article IV, the shares so redeemed or converted shall be canceled and shall not be issuable by the
Corporation. The Restated Certificate shall be appropriately amended to effect the
corresponding reduction in the Corporation’s authorized capital stock.

ARTICLE V

A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or
its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for
hability (1) for any breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders,
(11) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing
violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or (iv) for
any transaction from which the director derived any improper personal benefit. If the Delaware
General Corporation Law is amended after approval by the stockholders of this Article V to
authorize corporation action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors then
the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent
permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law as so amended.
