be delivered to the holders of Preferred Stock or Common Stock, as the case may be, shall be
valued as follows:

(A) For securities not subject to investment letter or other
similar restrictions on free marketability:

prices of the securities on such exchange over the thirty (30) trading days ending three (3)
trading days prior to the closing;

value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is
applicable) over the thirty (30) trading days ending three (3) trading days prior to the closing;
and

3) If there is no active public market, the fair market
value shall be the fair market value thereof (as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors).

letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of
a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount
from the market value determined as above in A(1), (2) or (3) to reflect the approximate fair
market value thereof, as mutually determined in good faith by the Board of Directors and the
holders of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the Preferred Stock then outstanding voting together as a
single class; provided that if the Board of Directors and the holders of at least two-thirds (2/3) of
the Preferred Stock then outstanding are unable to reach agreement, then by independent
appraisal by a mutually agreed to investment banker, the fees of which shall be paid by the

shall also notify such holders in writing of the final approval of such transaction. The first of
such notices shall describe the material terms and conditions of the impending transaction and
the provisions of Section 3, and the Corporation shall thereafter give such holders prompt notice
of any material changes. The transaction shall in no event take place sooner than twenty (20)
calendar days after the Corporation has given the first notice provided for herein or sooner than
ten (10) calendar days after the Corporation has given notice of any material changes provided
for herein; provided, however, that such periods may be shortened or waived upon the

(iii) The Series C Conversion Rate for Series C Preferred in effect at
any time for conversion of the Series C Preferred (the “Series C Conversion Rate’’) shall be the

transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the Corporation at such
office that it elects to convert the same and, if applicable, any event on which such conversion is
contingent. Such notice shall state the number of shares of Preferred Stock being converted.
Thereupon, the Corporation shall promptly issue and deliver at such office to such holder of
Preferred Stock a certificate or certificates, registered in such names as are specified by the
holder, for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled and shall
promptly pay in cash (at the Common Stock’s fair market value determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors as of the date of conversion) the value of any fractional share of Common
Stock otherwise issuable to any holder of Preferred Stock. Such conversion shall be deemed to

7
NSD163151.6
have been made at the close of business on the date of such surrender of the certificates
representing the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to
receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all
purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date.

e. Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If at any time or from
time to time after the date of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation the
Corporation effects a subdivision of the outstanding Common Stock without a corresponding
subdivision of the Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred or Series C Preferred, the Series A
Conversion Price, the Series B Conversion Price and the Series C Conversion Price in effect
immediately before that subdivision shall be proportionately decreased. Conversely, if at any
time or from time to time after the date of this Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation the Corporation combines the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller
number of shares without a corresponding combination of the Series A Preferred, Series B
Preferred or Series C Preferred, the Series A Conversion Price, the Series B Conversion Price
and the Series C Conversion Price in effect immediately before the combination shall be
proportionately increased. Any adjustment under this Section 4.e shall become effective at the
close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective.

time or from time to time after the date of this Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation the Corporation pays a dividend or other distribution in additional shares of
Common Stock or other securities or rights convertible into or entitling the holder thereof to
receive, directly or indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock, then and in each such event
the Series A Conversion Price, the Series B Conversion Price and the Series C Conversion Price
that is then in effect shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance, as provided below:

(i) The Conversion Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the
Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction equal to:

(A) _ the numerator of which is the total number of shares of
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance, and

(B) — the denominator of which is the total number of shares of
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance plus the
number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution;

(ii) If the Corporation fixes a record date to determine which holders
of Common Stock are entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution, the Conversion
Price shall be fixed as of the close of business on such record date and the number of shares of
Common Stock shall be calculated immediately prior to the close of business on such record
date; and

(iii) | Ifsuch record date is fixed and such dividend is not fully paid or if

such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the Conversion Price shall be
recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record date and thereafter the

NSD63151.6
Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this Section 4.f to reflect the actual payment of
such dividend or distribution.

g. Adjustment_for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. If at any
time or from time to time after the date of this Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, the Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred, Series
B Preferred or Series C Preferred is changed into the same or a different number of shares of any
class or classes of stock, whether by recapitalization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a
subdivision or combination of shares or stock dividend or a reorganization, merger, consolidation
or sale of assets provided for elsewhere in this Section 4), in any such event, each holder of
Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred or Series C Preferred shall then have the right to convert
such stock into the kind and amount of stock and other securities and property receivable upon
such recapitalization, reclassification or other change by holders of the maximum number of
shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred or
Series C Preferred could have been converted immediately prior to such recapitalization,
reclassification or change, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein or with respect to
such other securities or property by the terms thereof.

h. Reorganizations, Mergers or Consolidations. If at any time or from time
to time after the date of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, there is a capital
reorganization of the Corporation or the merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into
another corporation or another entity or person or an Asset Transfer (other than a
recapitalization, subdivision, combination, reclassification, exchange or substitution of shares
provided for elsewhere in this Section 4) (a “Capital Reorganization’), as a part of such Capital
Reorganization, a provision shall be made so that each holder of Series A Preferred, Series B
Preferred or Series C Preferred shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of the
Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred or Series C Preferred, the kind and amount of stock and
other securities and property receivable upon such Capital Reorganization by holders of the
maximum number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series A Preferred,
Series B Preferred or Series C Preferred could have been converted immediately prior to such
Capital Reorganization, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein or with respect to
such other securities or property by the terms thereof. In any such case, appropriate adjustment
shal} be made (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) in the application of the
provisions of this Section 4 with respect to the rights of the holders of Series A Preferred, Series
B Preferred or Series C Preferred after the Capital Reorganization to the end that the provisions
of this Section 4 (including adjustment of the Conversion Price then in effect and the number of
shares issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event and
be as nearly equivalent as practicable.

i. Sale of Shares Below Series A Preferred Conversion Price or Series C
Conversion Price.

Certificate of Incorporation, the Corporation issues or sells, or is deemed by the express
provisions of this Section 4.i to have issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common-Stock.(as__

effective Series C Conversion Price (each a “Qualified Dilutive Issuance’’), then in the case of a
Qualified Dilutive Issuance at less than the then effective Series A Conversion Price, the then
existing Series A Conversion Price and Series B Conversion Price shall seduced in the
case of a Qualified Dilutive Issuance at less than the then effective Series Onversion Price,
the then existing Series C Conversion Price shall be reduced, in each case as of the opening of
business on the date of such issue or sale, or deemed issue or sale, to a price (rounded to the
nearest cent) equal to the product (the “Effective Price’) of the Series A Conversion Price, the

Series B Conversion Price or the Series C Conversion Price, as applicable, multiplied by the
following fraction:

(A) _ the numerator of which is equal to the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance or sale (or deemed issuance or
sale) (assuming the conversion to Common Stock of all outstanding Preferred Stock plus the
total number of shares of Common Stock which the Aggregate Consideration (as defined below)
would purchase at the Series A Conversion Price, the Series B Conversion Price or the Series C
Conversion Price, as applicable, in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale (or deemed
issuance or sale); and

(B) the denominator of which is equal to the number of shares
of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance or sale (or deemed issuance or
sale) (assuming the conversion to Common Stock of ail outstanding Preferred Stock plus the
number of Additional Shares of Common Stock issued or sold, or deemed to have been issued or

Section 4.i, the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for any issue or sale (or
deemed issue or sale) of securities (the “Aggregate Consideration’’) shall be: (A) to the extent it
consists of cash, be the gross amount of cash received by the Corporation before deduction of
any underwriting or similar commissions, compensation or concessions paid or allowed by the
Corporation in connection with such issue or sale and without deduction of any expenses payable
by the Corporation, (B) to the extent it consists of property other than cash, be the fair value of
that property as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, and (C) if Additional Shares
of Common Stock, Convertible Securities (as defined below) or rights or options to purchase
either Additional Shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities are issued or sold together
with other stock or securities or other assets of the Corporation for a consideration which covers
both, be the portion of the consideration so received that may be reasonably determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors to be allocable to such Additional Shares of Common Stock,
Convertible Securities, or rights or options (other than the Convertible Securities).

(iv) | For the purpose of the adjustment required under this Section 4.i, if
the Corporation issues, sells or grants, in a Qualified Dilutive Issuance, (x) Preferred Stock or
other stock, options, warrants, purchase rights or other securities convertible into Additional
Shares of Common Stock (such convertible stock or securities being herein referred to as
“Convertible Securities”) or (y) rights or options (other than the Convertible Securities) for the

10
NSD\63151.6
purchase of Additional Shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities, whether or not such
rights or options are immediately exercisable, then in each case the Corporation shall be deemed
to have issued at the time of the grant, sale or issuance of such rights or options or Convertible
Securities the maximum number of Additional Shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise
or conversion thereof and to have received as consideration for the issuance of such shares an
amount equal to the total amount of the consideration, if any, received by the Corporation for the
issuance of such rights or options or Convertible Securities (as set forth in the documents and
instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision therein for subsequent adjustments
to such consideration or any additional consideration) plus:

(A) _ in the case of such rights or options, the minimum amounts
of consideration, if any, payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such rights or options;
and

(B) in the case of Convertible Securities, the minimum amounts
of consideration, if any, payable to the Corporation upon the conversion thereof (other than by
cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities); provided that
if the minimum amounts of such consideration cannot be ascertained, but are a function of
antidilution or similar protective clauses, the Corporation shall be deemed to have received the
minimum amounts of such consideration without reference to such clauses.

(C) If the minimum amount of consideration payable to the
Corporation upon the exercise or conversion of rights, options or Convertible Securities is
reduced over time or on the occurrence or non-occurrence of specified events other than by
reason of antidilution adjustments, the Effective Price shall be recalculated using the figure to
which such minimum amount of consideration is reduced; provided further, that if the minimum
amount of consideration payable to the Corporation upon the exercise or conversion of such
rights, options or Convertible Securities is subsequently increased over time or on the occurrence
or non-occurrence of specified events, the Effective Price shall be again recalculated using the
increased minimum amount of consideration payable to the Corporation upon the exercise or
conversion of such rights, options or Convertible Securities.

(D) No further adjustment of the Conversion Price, as adjusted
upon the issuance, sale or grant of such rights, options or Convertible Securities, shall be made
as a result of the actual issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock or the exercise of any
such rights or options or the conversion of any such Convertible Securities. If any such rights or
options or the conversion privilege represented by any such Convertible Securities shall expire

Securities, and such Additional Shares of Common Stock were issued or sold for the
consideration actually received by the Corporation upon such exercise, plus the additional
consideration, if any, actually received by the Corporation for the granting of all such rights or
options, whether or not exercised, or the additional consideration, if any, actually received by the

other securities issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock, if the Preferred Stock is then
convertible pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation, at its expense, shall promptly compute
such adjustment or readjustment (or series of adjustments) in accordance with the provisions
hereof and prepare a certificate showing such adjustment or readjustment (or series of
adjustments), and shall mail such certificate to each registered holder of Preferred Stock at the

Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series C Conversion Price, as applicable, at the time in effect
before the adjustment or readjustment and (ii) the type and amount, if any, of other property
which at the time would be received upon conversion of the Preferred Stock.

k. Notices of Record Date. Upon (i) any taking by the Corporation of a
record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof
who are entitled to receive any dividend or other distribution, or (i1) any capital reorganization of
the Corporation, any reclassification or recapitalization or transfer of the capital stock of the
Corporation in connection therewith, any merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into
any other corporation, or any Asset Transfer or Liquidation Event, the Corporation shall mail to
each holder of Preferred Stock at least ten (10) business days prior to the record date specified
therein (or such shorter period approved by the holders of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the
outstanding Preferred Stock voting together as a single class) a notice specifying (A) the date on
which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend or distribution and a
description of such dividend or distribution, (B) the date on which any such reorganization,
reclassification, transfer, consolidation, merger, Asset Transfer or Liquidation Event is expected

of Common Stock (or other securities) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common
Stock (or other securities) for securities or other property deliverable upon such reorganization,
reclassification, transfer, consolidation, merger, Asset Transfer or Liquidation Event. The
Corporation shall also use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to the holders of Preferred Stock
information that is reasonably sufficient to enable such holders to make a determination as to
whether it would be to their advantage to convert their shares of Preferred Stock to shares of
Common Stock pursuant to this Section 4 prior to any transaction listed above.

13
NSD\63151.6
l. Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically
be converted into fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock, at the then effective
Conversion Rate: (i) upon the vote or written consent of at least three fourths (3/4) of the then
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock voting together as a single class; or (ii) immediately prior
to the closing of a firm commitment underwritten public offering of Common Stock pursuant to
an effective registration statement on Form S-1 or Form SB-2 (or a successor form) filed under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, covering the offer and sale of Common Stock at an
offering price per share of at least $2.96 per share, as adjusted for any Recapitalization Event
(which represents a valuation of the Corporation’s fully diluted capital stock of at least
$210,000,000 immediately prior to the offer and sale of such Common Stock, with aggregate
gross proceeds to the Corporation (prior to underwriters’ commissions and expenses) of not less
than $40,000,000 and with such shares of Common Stock listed on a nationally recognized
exchange or the Nasdaq National Market. The Corporation shall give the holders of Preferred
Stock notice of any automatic conversion which is to take place pursuant to this Section 4.1 at
least five (5) business days prior to the occurrence of such event (or such shorter period approved
by the holders of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the outstanding Preferred Stock voting together as a
single class).

m. Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued
upon conversion of Preferred Stock. All shares of Common Stock (including fractions thereof)
issuable upon conversion of more than one share of Preferred Stock by a holder thereof shall be
aggregated for purposes of determining whether the conversion would result in the issuance of
any fractional share. If, after the aforementioned aggregation, the conversion would result in the
issuance of any fractional share, the Corporation shall, in lieu of issuing any fractional share, pay
cash equal to the product of such fractional share multiplied by the Common Stock’s fair market
value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) on the date of conversion.

n. Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at
all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock,
solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock, such
number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock. If at any time the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, the Corporation will promptly take such
corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but
unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such
purpose.

O. Notices. All notices and other communications required or permitted
hereunder shall be in writing and may be given by any means (e.g., mail, telecopier, electronic
mail, hand delivery, messenger, overnight courier service, etc.) addressed as set forth on the
Corporation’s books, or at such other address as the holder of Preferred Stock or holder of
Common Stock may designate in the future.

All such notices, requests and other communications will be deemed given upon
delivery at such holder’s proper address. Any such holder from time to time may change its

14
NSDW63151.6
address, facsimile number or other information for the purpose of notices to that holder by giving
prior written notice specifying such change to the Corporation.

p. Payment of Taxes. The Corporation will pay all taxes (other than taxes
based upon income) and other governmental charges that may be imposed with respect to the
issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of shares of Preferred Stock,
excluding any tax or other charge imposed in connection with any transfer involved in the issue
and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in which the shares of
Preferred Stock so converted were registered.
