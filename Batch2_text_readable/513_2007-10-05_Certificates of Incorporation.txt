dividends declared but unpaid thereon, and an amount equal to, in the case of Series B Preferred
Stock, the Series B Original Issue Price, plus any dividends declared but unpaid thereon, If upon

(as defined in Section 5) outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation or upon
conversion of Convertible Securities (as defined in Section 5) outstanding immediately prior to such
merger or consolidation shall be deemed to be outstanding immediately prior to such merger or
consolidation and, if applicable, converted or exchanged in such merger or consolidation on the
same terms as the actual outstanding shares of Common Stock are converted or exchanged) (a
“Surviving Merger”); provided, however, that a merger shall not constitute a Deemed Liquidation
Event if its sole purpose is to change the state of the Corporation’s corporate domicile to a
jurisdiction approved by the Board;

(B) the sale, lease, transfer or other disposition, in a single
transaction or series of related transactions, by the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation of
all or substantially all the assets of the Corporation and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, except where

Corporation in accordance with Subsections 3(a) and 3(b) above.

(iii) | The amount deemed paid or distributed to the holders of capital stock
of the Corporation upon any such merger, consolidation, sale, transfer, exclusive license, or other
disposition shall be the cash or the value of the property, rights or securities paid or distributed to
such holders by the Corporation or the acquiring person, firm or other entity. The value of such
property, rights or securities shall be determined in good faith by the Board, including the
affirmative vote of the Series A Directors and the Series B Director (each as defined below).

pa-1197144
5. Optional Conversion.

The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as follows (the “Conversion
Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the
option of the holder thereof. at any time and from time to time, and without the payment of
additional consideration by the holder thereof, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable
shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the applicable Original Issue Price by the
Conversion Price applicable to such share in effect at the time of conversion. The “Series A
Conversion Price” shall initially be equal to the Series A Original Issue Price, and the “Series B
Conversion Price” shall initially be equal to the Series B Original Issue Price. Such initial Series A
Conversion Price and initial Series B Conversion Price, and the rate at which shares of Series A
Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock may be converted into shares of Common Stock, shall
be subject to adjustment as provided below.

In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation or a Deemed
Liquidation Event, the Conversion Rights shall terminate at the close of business on the last full day
preceding the date fixed for the payment of any such amounts distributable on such event to the
holders of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock.

(b) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued
upon conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would
otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair
market value of a share of Common Stock as determined in good faith by the Board. Whether or not
fractional shares would be issuable upon such conversion shal] be determined on the basis of the
total number of shares of Preferred Stock the holder is at the time converting into Common Stock
and the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion.

(i) In order for a holder of Preferred Stock to voluntarily convert shares of
Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the certificate or
certificates for such shares of Preferred Stock (or, if such registered holder alleges that such
certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement reasonably
acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made
against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate), at the
office of the transfer agent for the Preferred Stock (or at the principal office of the Corporation if the
Corporation serves as its own transfer agent), together with written notice that such holder elects to
convert all or any number of the shares of the Preferred Stock represented by such certificate or
certificates and, if applicable, any event on which such conversion is contingent. Such notice shall
state such holder’s name or the names of the nominees in which such holder wishes the certificate or
certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued. If required by the Corporation, certificates
surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments
of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or his, her
or its attorney duly authorized in writing. The close of business on the date of receipt by the transfer
agent of such certificates (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement) and notice (or by the

pa-1 197144
Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent) shall be the time of conversion (the
“Conversion Time’), and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the shares
represented by such certificate shall be deemed to be outstanding of record as of such date. The
Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after the Conversion Time, issue and deliver at such office
to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to his, her or its such holder’s nominees, a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled,
together with cash in lieu of any fraction of a share.

(ii) | The Corporation shall at all times when the Preferred Stock shall be
outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued stock, for the purpose of
effecting the conversion of the Preferred Stock, such number of its duly authorized shares of
Common Stock as shal] from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding
Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock
shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock,
the Corporation shall take such corporate action as may be necessary to increase its authorized but
unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes,
including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of
any necessary amendment to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. Before taking
any action which would cause an adjustment reducing the Conversion Price for any series of
Preferred Stock below the then par value of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion
of the such shares of Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take any corporate action which may, in
the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Corporation may validly and legally issue
fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion Price.

(iii) | All shares of Preferred Stock which shall have been surrendered for
conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights with respect
to such shares, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and to vote, shall immediately cease
and terminate at the Conversion Time, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive shares
of Common Stock in exchange therefor and to receive payment of any dividends declared but unpaid
thereon. Any shares of Preferred Stock so converted shall be retired and cancelled and shall not be
reissued as shares of such series, and the Corporation (without the need for stockholder action) may
from time to time take such appropriate action as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number
of shares of Preferred Stock accordingly.

(iv) | Upon any such conversion, no adjustment to the Conversion Price of
each series of Preferred Stock shall be made for any declared but unpaid dividends on such series of
Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion or on the Common Stock delivered upon conversion.

(v) The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and other similar taxes that
may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon conversion
of shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 5. The Corporation shall not, however, be
required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and
delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in which the shares of Preferred Stock
so converted were registered, and no such issuance or delivery shall be made unless and until the
person or entity requesting such issuance has paid to the Corporation the amount of any such tax or
has established, to the satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax has been paid.

Corporation after the Original [ssue Date, other than the following (“Exempted Securities”):

(I) shares of Common Stock issued or deemed issued as a
dividend or distribution on Series A Preferred Stock

Board, including the Series A Directors and the Series
B Director; or

(IV) | shares of Common Stock issued or issuable to banks,
equipment lessors or other financial institutions, or to
real property lessors, pursuant to a debt financing,
equipment leasing or real property leasing transaction
approved by the Board, including the Series A
Directors and the Series B Director.

(ii) No Adjustment_of Conversion Prices. No adjustment in the
Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock shall be made as the result of the issuance of

Additional Shares of Common Stock ifthe consideration per share (determined pursuant to
Subsection 5(d)(v)) for such Additional Shares of Common Stock issued or deemed to be issued by

pa-1197144 10
the Corporation is equal to or greater than the applicable Conversion Price in effect immediately
prior to the issuance or deemed issuance of such Additional Shares of Common Stock. With respect
to the Series A Preferred Stock, no adjustment in the Series A Conversion Price shall be made as a
result of the issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock if prior to such issuance or deemed
issuance, the Corporation receives written notice from the holders of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the
then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, agreeing that no such adjustment shall be made
as the result of the issuance or deemed issuance of such Additional Shares of Common Stock. With
respect to the Series B Preferred Stock, no adjustment in the Series B Conversion Price shall be
made as a result of the issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock if prior to such issuance or
deemed issuance, the Corporation receives written notice from the holders of at least two-thirds (2/3)
of the then outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock, agreeing that no such adjustment shall be
made as the result of the issuance or deemed issuance of such Additional Shares of Common Stock.

(iii) | Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock.

(A) If the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the
Original Issue Date shall issue any Options or Convertible Securities (excluding Options or
Convertible Securities which, upon exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, would entitle the holder
thereof to receive Exempted Securities pursuant to Subsections 5(d)(i)(D)(J), (II), (IN), or (IV)) or
shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive any
such Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set
forth in the instrument relating thereto, assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to exercisability,
convertibility or exchangeability but without regard to any provision contained therein for a
subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case of
Convertible Securities and Options therefor, the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, shall be deemed to be Additional Shares of Common Stock issued as of the time of such
issue or, in case such a record date shall] have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record
date.

(B) If the terms of any Option or Convertible Security, the issuance
of which resulted in an adjustment to the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock pursuant
to the terms of Subsection 5(d)(iv) below, are revised (either automatically pursuant to the provisions
contained therein or as a result of an amendment to such terms) to provide for either (1) any increase
or decrease in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or
exchange of any such Option or Convertible Security or (2) any increase or decrease in the
consideration payable to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion or exchange, then, effective
upon such increase or decrease becoming effective, the Conversion Price of such series of Preferred
Stock computed upon the original issue of such Option or Convertible Security (or upon the
occurrence of a record date with respect thereto) shall be readjusted to such Conversion Price as
would have obtained had such revised terms been in effect upon the original date of issuance of such
Option or Convertible Security. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment pursuant to this
clause (B) shall have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock to
an amount which exceeds the lower of (i) the Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock on
the original adjustment date, or (ii) the Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock that would
have resulted from any issuances of Additional Shares of Common Stock between the original
adjustment date and such readjustment date.

(C) If the terms of any Option or Convertible Security (excluding
Options or Convertible Securities which, upon exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, would entitle
the holder thereof to receive Exempted Securities pursuant to Subsections 5(d)(i)(E)(D, (1D, (11), or
(IV)), the issuance of which did not result in an adjustment to the Conversion Price of a series of
Preferred Stock pursuant to the terms of Subsection 5(d)(iv) below (either because the consideration
per share (determined pursuant to Subsection 5(d)(v) hereof) of the Additional Shares of Common
Stock subject thereto was equal to or greater than the Conversion Price of such series of Preferred
Stock then in effect. or because such Option or Convertible Security was issued before the Original
Issue Date), are revised after the Original Issue Date (either automatically pursuant to the provisions
contained therein or as a result of an amendment to such terms) to provide for cither (1) any increase
or decrease in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or
exchange of any such Option or Convertible Security or (2) any increase or decrease in the
consideration payable to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion or exchange, then such
Option or Convertible Security, as so amended, and the Additional Shares of Common Stock subject
thereto (determined in the manner provided in Subsection 5(d)(i1i)(A) above) shall be deemed to have
been issued effective upon such increase or decrease becoming effective. If the change in such
Option or Convertible Security causes an adjustment pursuant to this provision and such Option or
Convertible Security is then further changed as a result of the adjustments made pursuant to this
provision, no further adjustment shall be made hereunder as a result of the further automatic change in
such Option or Convertible Secunity.

(D) Upon the expiration or termination of any unexercised Option
or unconverted or unexchanged Convertible Security which resulted (either upon its original issuance
or upon a revision of its terms) in an adjustment to the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred
Stock pursuant to the terms of Subsection 5(d)(iv) below, the Conversion Price of such series of
Preferred Stock shall be readjusted to such series Conversion Price as would have obtained had such
Option or Convertible Security never been issued.

(iv) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock Upon Issuance of
Additional Shares of Common Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the

Original Issue Date issue Additional Shares of Common Stock (including Additional Shares of
Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to Subsection 5(d)(iii)), without consideration or fora
consideration per share less than the Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock in effect
immediately prior to such issue, then the Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock shall be
reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price equal to the price paid per share for such Additional
Shares of Common Stock.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this Subsection 5(d),
the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional Shares of Common
Stock shall be computed as follows:

(A) Cash and Property: Such consideration shall:

(1) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
aggregate amount of cash received by the
Corporation, excluding amounts paid or payable for
accrued interest;

pa-1197144 12
determined by dividing:

(vi)

pa-1197144

(II)

(III)

insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair market value thereof at the time
of such issue, as determined in good faith by the
Board (including the affirmative vote of the Series A
Directors and the Series B Director); and

in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock are
issued together with other shares or securities or other
assets of the Corporation for consideration which
covers both, be the proportion of such consideration
so received, computed as provided in clauses (I) and
(II) above, as determined in good faith by the Board
(including the affirmative vote of the Series A
Directors and the Senes B Director).

(B) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per
share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been
issued pursuant to Subsection 5(d)(iii), relating to Options and Convertible Securities, shall be

(1)

(II)

the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the
Corporation as consideration for the issue of such
Options or Convertible Securities, plus the minimum
aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set
forth in the instruments relating thereto, without
tegard to any provision contained therein for a
subsequent adjustment of such consideration) payable
to the Corporation upon the exercise of such Options
or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible
Securities, the exercise of such Options for
Convertible Securities and the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, by

the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as
set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without
regard to any provision contained therein for a
subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon
the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities.

Multiple Closing Dates. In the event the Corporation shall issue on
more than one date Additional Shares of Common Stock that are a part of one transaction or a series

of related transactions and that would result in an adjustment to the Conversion Price of any series of
Preferred Stock pursuant to the terms of Subsection 5(d)(iv) above. then, upon the final such
issuance, the Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock shall be readjusted to give effect to
all such issuances as if they occurred on the date of the first such issuance (and without additional
giving effect to any adjustments as a result of any subsequent issuances within such period).

(e) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. Ifthe Corporation shall at any
time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date effect a subdivision of the outstanding
Common Stock without a comparable subdivision of any series of Preferred Stock or combine the
outstanding shares of any series of Preferred Stock without a comparable combination of the
Common Stock, the Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately before
that subdivision or combination shall be proportionately decreased so that the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be increased in proportion
to such increase in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. If the
Corporation shall at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date combine the
outstanding shares of Common Stock without a comparable combination of a series of Preferred
Stock or effect a subdivision of the outstanding shares of a series of Preferred Stock without a
comparable subdivision of the Common Stock, the Conversion Price of such series of Preferred
Stock in effect immediately before the combination or subdivision shall be proportionately increased
so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series
shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in the aggregate number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding. Any adjustment under this subsection shall become effective at the close of
business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective.

(f) Adjustment for Certain Dividends and Distributions. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shal! make or issue, or fix
a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or
other distribution payable on the Common Stock in additional shares of Common Stock, then and in
each such event the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately before
such event shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance or, in the event such a record date shall
have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, by multiplying the applicable
Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock then in effect by a fraction:

(1) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of business on
such record date, and

(2) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of business
on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such
dividend or distribution;

provided, however, that if such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend is not fully paid
or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the Conversion Price of each
series of Preferred Stock shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record
date and thereafter the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock shall be adjusted pursuant
to this subsection as of the time of actual payment of such dividends or distributions; and provided
further, however, that no such adjustment shall be made if the holders of such series of Preferred
Stock simultaneously receive (i) a dividend or other distribution of shares of Common Stock in a
number equal to the number of shares of Common Stock as they would have received if all

pa-1197144 14
outstanding shares of such series of Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock on the
date of such event or (ii) a dividend or other distribution of shares of such series of Preferred Stock
which are convertible, as of the date of such event, into such number of shares of Common Stock as
is equal to the number of additional shares of Common Stock being issued with respect to each share
of Common Stock in such dividend or distribution.

(g) Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall make or issue, or fix

arecord date for the determination of holders of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to receive, a
dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the Corporation (other than a distribution of
shares of Common Stock in respect of outstanding shares of Common Stock) or in other property
and the provisions of Section (C)(2) do not apply to such dividend or distribution, then and in each
such event the holders of each series of Preferred Stock shall receive, simultaneously with the
distribution to the holders of such capital stock, a dividend or other distribution of such securities or
other property in an amount equal to the amount of such securities or other property as they would
have received if all outstanding shares of such series of Preferred Stock had been converted into
Common Stock on the date of such event.

(h) Adjustment for Merger or Reorganization, etc. Subject to the provisions of
Subsection 3(c), if there shall occur any reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
consolidation or merger involving the Corporation in which the Common Stock (but not the
Preferred Stock) is converted into or exchanged for securities, cash or other property (other than a
transaction covered by Subsections (e), (f} or (g) of this Section 5), then, following any such
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger, each share of each series of
Preferred Stock shall thereafter be convertible in lieu of the Common Stock into which it was
convertible prior to such event into the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property which a
holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation issuable upon conversion of
one share of such series of Preferred Stock immediately prior to such reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification. consolidation or merger would have been entitled to receive
pursuant to such transaction; and, in such case, appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith
by the Board) shall be made in the application of the provisions in this Section 5 with respect to the
rights and interests thereafter of the holders of such series of Preferred Stock, to the end that the
provisions set forth in this Section 5 (including provisions with respect to changes in and other
adjustments of the Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock) shall thereafter be applicable,
as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any securities or other property thereafter deliverable
upon the conversion of such series of Preferred Stock.

(i) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 5, the
Corporation at its expense shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable but in any event not later than
10 days thereafter, compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof
and furnish to each holder of such series of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment
or readjustment (including the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property into which the
series of Preferred Stock is convertible) and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment
or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
written request at any time of any holder of shares of any series of Preferred Stock (but in any event
not later than | 0 days thereafter), furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a certificate setting

pa-1197144 15
forth (i) the Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock then in effect, and (ii) the number of
shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other securities, cash or property which then
would be received upon the conversion of such series of Preferred Stock.

Gj) Notice of Record Date. In the event:

(i) the Corporation shall take a record of the holders of its Common Stock
(or other stock or securities at the time issuable upon conversion of any Preferred Stock) for the
purpose of entitling or enabling them to receive any dividend or other distribution, or to receive any
right to subscribe for or purchase any shares of stock of any class or any other securities, or to
receive any other nght; or

(ii) | ofany capital reorganization of the Corporation, any reclassification of
the Common Stock of the Corporation, or any Deemed Liquidation Event; or

(iii) ofthe voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up
of the Corporation,

then, and in each such case, the Corporation will send or cause to be sent to the holders of Preferred
Stock a notice specifying, as the case may be, (i) the record date for such dividend, distribution or
right. and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or night, or (ii) the effective date
on which such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer, dissolution,
liquidation or winding-up is proposed to take place, and the time, if any is to be fixed, as of which
the holders of record of Common Stock (or such other stock or securities at the time issuable upon
the conversion of any Preferred Stock) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock
(or such other stock or securities) for securities or other property deliverable upon such
reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-
up, and the amount per share and character of such exchange applicable to each series of Preferred
Stock and the Common Stock. Such notice shall be sent at least 10 days prior to the record date or
effective date for the event specified in such notice. Any notice required by the provisions hereof to
be given to a holder of shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed sent to such holder if deposited in
the United States mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to such holder at such holder’s address
appearing on the books of the Corporation.

6. Mandatory Conversion.

(a) Upon the earlier of (A) the closing of the sale of shares of Common Stock to
the public at a price of at least $9.74 per share (subject to appropriate adjustment for stock splits,

commitment underwritten initial public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, resulting in at least $40 million of gross proceeds to the
Corporation (a “Qualifying Public Offering’), or (B) a date specified by vote or written consent of
the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding Preferred Stock, voting as a single class on
an as-converted basis, and fifty-five percent (55%) of the then outstanding shares of Series B
Preferred Stock, voting as a separate series on an as-converted basis (the “Mandatory Conversion
Date”), (i) all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of

pa-1197144 16
Common Stock, at the then effective conversion rates and (i1) such shares may not be reissued by the
Corporation as shares of such series.

(b) All holders of record of shares of Preferred Stock shall be given written notice
of the Mandatory Conversion Date and the place designated for mandatory conversion of all such
shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 6. Such notice need not be given in advance of the
occurrence of the Mandatory Conversion Date. Such notice shall be sent by first class or registered
mail, postage prepaid, or given by electronic communication in compliance with the provisions of
the General Corporation Law, to each record holder of Preferred Stock. Upon receipt of such notice,
each holder of shares of Preferred Stock shall surrender his, her or its certificate or certificates for all
such shares to the Corporation at the place designated in such notice, and shall thereafter receive
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
this Section 6. On the Mandatory Conversion Date, all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall
be deemed to have been converted into shares of Common Stock, which shall be deemed to be
outstanding of record, and all rights with respect to the Preferred Stock so converted, including the
rights, if any, to receive notices and vote (other than as a holder of Common Stock), will terminate,
except only the rights of the holders thereof, upon surrender of their certificate or certificates
therefor, to receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which such Preferred
Stock has been converted, and payment of any declared but unpaid dividends thereon. If so required
by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by
written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed
by the registered holder or by his, her or its attorney duly authorized in writing. As soon as

her or its written order, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock
issuable on such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof and cash as provided in
Subsection 5(b) in respect of any fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such
conversion.

(c) All certificates evidencing shares of Preferred Stock which are required to be
surrendered for conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof shall, from and after the
Mandatory Conversion Date, be deemed to have been retired and cancelled and the shares of
Preferred Stock represented thereby converted into Common Stock for all purposes, notwithstanding
the failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender such certificates on or prior to such date.
Such converted Preferred Stock may not be reissued as shares of such Series, and the Corporation
may thereafter take such appropriate action (without the need for stockholder action) as may be
necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Preferred Stock accordingly.

(d) Special Mandatory Conversion.

such Non-Participating Holder’s Preferred Stock, as applied individually to each series of Preferred
Stock held by such Non-Participating Holder. shall automatically and without further action on the
part of such holder be converted effective upon, subject to, and immediately prior to, the
consummation of the Qualified Financing (the “Mandatory Offering Date”) into shares of
Common Stock, at the then effective conversion rate for such series of Preferred Stock. Upon
conversion pursuant to this Section 6(d)(i), the shares of Preferred Stock so converted shall be
cancelled and not subject to reissuance.

(ii) | The holder of any shares of Preferred Stock converted pursuant to
Section 6(d)(i) shall deliver to the Corporation during regular business hours at the office of any
transfer agent of the Corporation for the Preferred Stock, or at such other place as may be designated
by the Corporation, the certificate or certificates for the shares so converted, duly endorsed or
assigned in blank or to the Corporation. As promptly as practicable thereafter, the Corporation shall
issue and deliver to such holder, at the place designated by such holder, a certificate or certificates

the number of shares, if any, of each series of Preferred Stock represented by each such certificate or
certificates and not converted into Common Stock pursuant to this Section 6(d), and such holder
shall be deemed to have become a stockholder of record of Common Stock on the Mandatory
Offering Date, unless the transfer books of the Corporation are closed on that date, in which event
he, she or it shall be deemed to have become a stockholder of record of Common Stock on the next
succeeding date on which the transfer books are open.

any cutbacks or limitations established by the Board and applied on a pro rata basis to all holders of
Preferred Stock.
