A. This Corporation is authorized to issue two classes of stock to be designated,
respectively, “Common Stock” and “Preferred Stock.” The total number of shares which the
Corporation is authorized to issue is 142,500,000 shares, 110,000,000 shares of which shall be
Common Stock (the “Common Stock”), and 32,500,000 shares of which shall be Preferred
Stock (the “Preferred Stock”). The Preferred Stock shall have a par value of $0.001 per share,
and the Common Stock shall have a par value of $0.001 per share.

B. The undesignated Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more
series.

Cc. 16,000,000 of the authorized shares of Preferred Stock are hereby designated
“Series A Preferred Stock” (the “Series A Preferred”).

D. 16,500,000 of the authorized shares of Preferred Stock are hereby designated
“Series A-1 Preferred Stock” (the “Series A-1 Preferred”).

E. The rights, preferences, privileges, restrictions and other matters relating to the
Series A and Series A-1 Preferred Stock are as follows:

1. DIVIDEND RIGHTS.

(a) Holders of shares of Series A Preferred and Series A-1 Preferred,
prior and in preference to the holders of any other capital stock of the Company (“Junior
Stock”), shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors, but only
out of funds that are legally available therefor, cash dividends at the rate of 8% of the Series A
Original Issue Price (as defined below) or Series A-1 Original Issue Price (as defined below), as
applicable, per annum on each outstanding share of Series A Preferred or Series A-1 Preferred
(as appropriately adjusted for Recapitalizations (as defined below)). The Original Issue Price of
the Series A Preferred shall be $1.816 (the “Series A Original Issue Price”) and the Original
Issue Price of the Series A-1 Preferred shall be $1.677 (the “Series A-1 Original Issue Price”).
The right to receive dividends on shares of Preferred Stock shall not be cumulative, and no right
to such dividends shall accrue to a holder of Preferred Stock by reason of the fact that dividends
on said shares are not declared or paid in any calendar year. The term “Recapitalization” shall
mean, with respect to a particular series or class of capital stock of the Corporation, any stock
dividends, splits, distributions, subdivisions, combinations, reverse stock splits, reclassifications,
recapitalizations and the like with respect to such shares of such series or class of the
Corporation’s capital stock, in each case, effective after the date hereof.

(b) So long as any shares of Series A Preferred or Series A-1 Preferred
shall be outstanding, no dividend, whether in cash or property, shall be paid or declared, nor shall
any other distribution be made, on any Junior Stock, nor shall any shares of any Junior Stock of
the Company be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for value by the Company (except
for repurchases of shares of Common Stock from employees, officers, directors, consultants or
other persons performing services for the Corporation or any subsidiary pursuant to agreements

2.
approved by the Company’s Board of Directors under which the Corporation has the option to
repurchase such shares at cost upon the occurrence of certain events, such as the termination of
employment or services or through the exercise of any right of first refusal) until all dividends
(set forth in Section 1(a) above) on the Series A Preferred or Series A-1 Preferred shall have
been paid or declared and set apart. In the event dividends are paid on any share of Junior Stock,
an additional dividend shall be paid with respect to all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred
and Series A-1 Preferred in an amount equal per share (on an as-if-converted to Common Stock
basis) to the amount paid or set aside for each share of Junior Stock. The provisions of this
Section 1(b) shall not, however, apply to any repurchase of any outstanding securities of the
Company that is approved by the Company’s Board of Directors.

2. VOTING RIGHTS.

(a) General Rights. Except as otherwise provided herein or as
required by law, the Preferred Stock shall vote together with the Common Stock at any annual or
special meeting of the stockholders and not as a separate class, and may act by written consent in
the same manner as the Common Stock, in either case upon the following basis: each holder of
shares of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to such number of votes as shal! be equal to the whole
number of shares of Common Stock into which such holder’s aggregate number of shares of
Preferred Stock are convertible (pursuant to Section 4 hereof) immediately after the close of
business on the record date fixed for such meeting or such written consent and shall have voting
rights and powers equal to the voting rights and powers of the Common Stock and shall be
entitled to notice of any stockholders’ meeting in accordance with the bylaws of the Company.
Fractional votes shall not, however, be permitted, and any fractional voting rights on an as-
converted basis (after aggregating all shares into which shares of Preferred Stock held by each
holder could be converted), shall be rounded to the nearest whole number (with one-half being
rounded upward).

(b) Election of Board of Directors. The holders of Series A
Preferred, voting as a separate series, shall be entitled to elect one member of the Company’s
Board of Directors at each meeting or pursuant to each consent of the Company’s stockholders
for the election of directors, and to remove from office such director and to fill any vacancy
caused by the resignation, death or removal of such director. The holders of Series A-1
Preferred, voting as a separate series, shall be entitled to elect one member of the Company’s
Board of Directors at each meeting or pursuant to each consent of the Company’s stockholders
for the election of directors, and to remove from office such director and to fill any vacancy
caused by the resignation, death or removal of such director. The holders of Common Stock,
voting together as a separate class, shall be entitled to elect two members of the Company’s
Board of Directors at each meeting or pursuant to each consent of the Company’s stockholders
for the election of directors, and to remove from office such directors and to fill any vacancy
caused by the resignation, death or removal of such directors. The holders of Common Stock
and Preferred Stock, voting together as if a single class and on an as-if-converted-to-Common-
Stock basis, shall be entitled to elect all remaining members of the Board of Directors at each
meeting or pursuant to each consent of the Company’s stockholders for the election of directors,
and to remove from office such directors and to fill any vacancy caused by the resignation, death
or removal of such directors. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 223(a)(1) and 223(a)(2)
of the General Corporation Law, any vacancy, including newly created directorships resulting
from any increase in the authorized number of directors or amendment of this Second Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, and vacancies created by removal or resignation of a
director, may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, though less than a quorum, or
by a sole remaining director, and the directors so chosen shall hold office until the next annual
election and until their successors are duly elected and shall qualify, unless sooner displaced;
provided, however, that where such vacancy occurs among the directors elected by the holders of
a class or series of stock, the holders of shares of such class or series may override the Board’s
action to fill such vacancy by (i) voting for their own designee to fill such vacancy at a meeting
of the Company’s stockholders or (ii) written consent, if the consenting stockholders hold a
sufficient number of shares to elect their designee at a meeting of the stockholders.

(c) Removal. The Board of Directors or any individual director may
be removed from office at any time without cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at
least a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on such removal; provided, however,
that in the event the Corporation is subject to cumulative voting pursuant to the application of
Section 2115 of the California Corporations Code, then unless the entire Board is removed, no
individual director may be removed when the votes cast against such director’s removal, or not
consenting in writing to such removal, would be sufficient to elect that director if voted
cumulatively at an election in which the same total number of votes were cast (or, if such action
is taken by written consent, all shares entitled to vote were voted) and the entire number of
directors authorized at the time of such director’s most recent election were then being elected.

(d) Protective Provisions. The Corporation shall not (by amendment,
merger, consolidation, reclassification or otherwise), without first obtaining the approval (by
vote or written consent, as provided by law) of the holders of at least sixty percent (60%) of the
then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class on the basis of one
vote for each share of Preferred Stock, take any action that:

(i) increases or decreases the authorized number of shares of
Common Stock or Preferred Stock;

(ii) results in the payment or declaration of any dividend (other
than in Common Stock) on any shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock or the redemption,
purchase or other acquisition (or payment into or the setting aside of funds for a sinking fund for
such purpose) of any share or shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock; provided, however,
that this restriction shall not apply to the repurchase of shares of Common Stock from
employees, officers, directors, consultants or other persons performing services for the
Corporation or any subsidiary pursuant to agreements approved by the Company’s Board of
Directors under which the Corporation has the option to repurchase such shares at cost upon the
occurrence of certain events, such as the termination of employment or services or through the
exercise of any contractual right of first refusal;

(iii) results in any Acquisition or Asset Transfer (each term as
defined in Section 3(b) herein);
(iv) amends any provision of the Company’s Second Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws;

(v) increases or decreases the authorized size of the Company’s
Board of Directors; or

(vi) —_ results in any Liquidation Event (as defined below).

In addition, the Corporation shall not (by amendment, merger, consolidation, reclassification or
otherwise), without first obtaining the approval (by vote or written consent, as provided by law)
of the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding shares of a given series of Preferred
Stock, voting as a single class on the basis of one vote for each share of such series of Preferred
Stock, take any action that:

(i) alters or waives any of the rights, preferences or privileges
of such series of Preferred Stock;

(ii) | increases or decreases the number of authorized shares of
such series of Preferred Stock;

(iii) | would result in the issuance of additional shares of such
series of Preferred Stock; or

(iv) authorizes, creates or issues, or obligates itself to issue, any
other debt or equity security, including any other security convertible into or exercisable for any
equity security, having a preference over, or being on a parity with, said series of Preferred Stock
with respect to dividends, redemption, conversion, liquidation or otherwise.

3. LIQUIDATION RIGHTS.

(a) Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company (a
“Liquidation Event”), whether voluntary or involuntary, prior and in preference to any
distribution or payment of any of the assets of the Corporation or proceeds of such Liquidation
Event (as applicable) to the holders of any Junior Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, the
holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Company an
amount per share of Preferred Stock equal to the greater of (i) the proceeds they would have
received had their Preferred Stock converted to Common Stock immediately prior to the
Liquidation Event or (ii) in the case of Series A Preferred, the Series A Original Issue Price (as
appropriately adjusted for Recapitalizations), plus all declared and unpaid dividends on the
Series A Preferred, for each share of Series A Preferred held by them, and, in the case of Series
A-1 Preferred, the Series A-1 Original Issue Price (as appropriately adjusted for
Recapitalizations), plus all declared and unpaid dividends on the Series A-1 Preferred, for each
share of Series A-1 Preferred held by them. If, upon any such liquidation, distribution, or
winding up, the assets of the Company shall be insufficient to make payment in full to all holders
of Series A Preferred and Series A-1 Preferred of the liquidation preferences set forth in clause
(ii) above, then, subject to the rights of any series of Preferred Stock that may from time to time
come into existence, such assets shall be distributed among the holders of Series A Preferred and
Series A-1 Preferred at the time outstanding, ratably in proportion to the full amounts to which
they would otherwise be respectively entitled.

(b) The following events shall be deemed to be a Liquidation Event
under this Section 3:

{i) the closing of any consolidation or merger of the Company
with or into any other corporation or other entity or person, or any other corporate
reorganization, in which the stockholders of the Company immediately prior to such
consolidation, merger or reorganization own less than 50% of the voting power or equity interest
in the Company immediately after such consolidation, merger or reorganization, or any
transaction or series of related transactions to which the Company is a party in which more than
50% of the voting power or equity interest in the Company is transferred, excluding (A) any
consolidation or merger effected exclusively to change the domicile of the Company and (B) any
transaction or series of transactions principally for bona fide equity financing purposes in which
cash is received by the Company or any successor or indebtedness of the Company is cancelled
or converted or a combination thereof (an “Aequisition”); or

(ii) the closing of a sale, lease or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Company (an “Asset Transfer”).

(iii) In any of such events, if the consideration received by the
Corporation or the proceeds to be distributed to holders of shares of the Company’s capital stock
(as applicable) is other than cash, its value will be deemed its fair market value as determined in
good faith by the Board of Directors. Any securities shall be valued as follows:

(A) Securities not subject to investment letter or other
similar restrictions on free marketability:

(1) If traded on a securities exchange or through
The Nasdaq Stock Market, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of
the securities on such quotation system over the 20-trading day period ending three trading days
prior to the closing of the Liquidation Event;

(2) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value
shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over
the 20-trading day period ending three trading days prior to the closing of the Liquidation Event;
and

(3) If there is no active public market, the value
shall be the fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(B) The method of valuation of securities subject to
investment letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely
by virtue of a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an

6.
appropriate discount from the market value determined as above in (A) (1), (2) or (3) to reflect
the approximate fair market value thereof, as determined by the Board of Directors.

(C) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the consideration
received by the Corporation or the proceeds to be distributed to holders of shares of the
Corporation’s capital stock is other than cash, and the definitive merger agreement, asset
purchase agreement or other definitive transaction document entered into with respect to such
Liquidation Event specifies an alternative method of determining the value of such consideration
or proceeds, then, for the purpose of this Section 3(b), the value of such consideration or
proceeds shall be determined in accordance with the method set forth in such merger agreement,
asset purchase agreement or other definitive transaction document, as applicable.

(iv) Notice of Transaction. Upon (i) any taking by the Company
of a record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders
thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend or other distribution, or (41) any Acquisition or
other capital reorganization of the Company, any reclassification or recapitalization of the capital
stock of the Company, any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into any other
corporation, any Asset Transfer or any Liquidation Event, the Company shall mail to each holder
of Preferred Stock at least ten days prior to the record date specified therein (or such shorter
period approved by at least sixty percent (60%) of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock,
voting as a single class and on an as-converted basis) a notice specifying (A) the date on which
any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend or distribution and a description
of such dividend or distribution, (B) the date on which any such Acquisition, reorganization,
reclassification, transfer, consolidation, merger, Asset Transfer or Liquidation Event is expected
to become effective, and (C) the date, if any, that is to be fixed as to when the holders of record
of Common Stock (or other securities) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common
Stock (or other securities) for securities or other property deliverable upon such Acquisition,
reorganization, reclassification, transfer, consolidation, merger, Asset Transfer or Liquidation
Event.

(v) Effect of Noncompliance. In the event the requirements of
this Section 3(b) are not complied with, the Corporation shall forthwith either cause the closing
of the Liquidation Event to be postponed until such requirements have been complied with, or
cancel such transaction, in which event the rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of the
Series A Preferred shall revert to and be the same as such rights, preferences and privileges
existing immediately prior to the date of the notice referred to in Section 3(b){iv) hereof.

4. CONVERSION RIGHTS.

The holders of Preferred Stock shall have the following rights with respect
to the conversion of the Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock (the “Conversion
Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Series A Preferred shall be
convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such
share at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for the Series A Preferred, into that

7.
number of fully paid, nonassessable shares of Common Stock determined by dividing the Series
A Original Issue Price by the Series A Conversion Price, determined as hereafter provided, in
effect on the date the certificate is surrendered for conversion. The number of shares of
Common Stock into which each share of Series A Preferred may be converted is hereinafter
referred to as the “Series A Conversion Rate.” The initial conversion price per share of Series
A Preferred (the “Series A Conversion Price”) shall be equal to the Series A Original Issue
Price. Each share of Series A-1 Preferred shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof,
at any time after the date of issuance of such share at the office of the Corporation or any transfer
agent for the Series A-1 Preferred, into that number of fully paid, nonassessable shares of
Common Stock determined by dividing the Series A-1 Original Issue Price by the Series A-1
Conversion Price, determined as hereafter provided, in effect on the date the certificate is
surrendered for conversion. The number of shares of Common Stock into which each share of
Series A-1 Preferred may be converted is hereinafter referred to as the “Series A-1 Conversion
Rate.” The initial conversion price per share of Series A-1 Preferred (the “Series A-1
Conversion Price”) shall be equal to the Series A-1 Original Issue Price.

(b) Automatic Conversion.

(i) Each share of Series A Preferred shall automatically be
converted into fully paid, non-assessable shares of Common Stock, at the then-effective Series A
Conversion Rate, and each share of Series A-1 Preferred shall automatically be converted into
fully paid, non-assessable shares of Common Stock, at the then-effective Series A-1 Conversion
Rate, (A) upon the receipt by the Corporation of a written request for such conversion from the
holders of at least sixty percent (60%) of the Preferred Stock then outstanding, or, if later, the
effective date for conversion specified in such requests, or (B) immediately prior to the closing
of a firmly underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, covering the offer and sale of Common Stock for the
account of the Company which results in aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of at least
$30,000,000 (a “Qualified Public Offering”).

(ii) | Upon the occurrence of either of the events specified in
Section 4(b)(i) above, the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically
without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates
representing such shares are surrendered to the Company or its transfer agent; provided,
however, that the Company shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion unless the certificates evidencing such shares of
Preferred Stock are either delivered to the Company or its transfer agent as provided below, or
the holder notifies the Company or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen
or destroyed and executes an agreement reasonably satisfactory to the Company to indemnify the
Company from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates. Upon the occurrence
of such automatic conversion of the Preferred Stock, the holders thereof shall surrender the
certificates representing such shares at the office of the Company or any transfer agent for the
Preferred Stock. Thereupon, there shall be issued and delivered to each such holder promptly at
such office and in its name as shown on such surrendered certificate or certificates, a certificate
or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Preferred

8.
Stock surrendered were convertible on the date on which such automatic conversion occurred,
and any declared and unpaid dividends shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of Section
A(e).

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. Each holder of Preferred Stock who
desires to convert the same into shares of Common Stock pursuant to this Section 4 shall
surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the principal corporate office of
the Company or any transfer agent for such series of Preferred Stock, and shall give written
notice to the Company at such office that such holder elects to convert the same and shall state
therein the name or names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock are
to be issued. Such notice shall state the number of shares of Preferred Stock being converted.
Thereupon, the Company shall promptly issue and deliver at such office to such holder of
Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the
number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled and shall promptly pay (i) in
cash or, at the option of the holders of at least sixty percent (60%) of the then outstanding shares
of Preferred Stock, in Common Stock (at the Common Stock’s fair market value determined by
the Board of Directors as of the date of such conversion), any declared and unpaid dividends on
the shares of Preferred Stock being converted and (ii) in cash (at the Common Stock’s fair
market value determined by the Board of Directors as of the date of conversion) the value of any
fractional share of Common Stock otherwise issuable to any holder of Preferred Stock. Such
conversion shall be deemed to have been made at the close of business on the date of such
surrender of the certificates representing the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the
person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion
shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock
on such date.

(d) Issuance of Additional Stock Below the Applicable Conversion
Price.

(i) (A) If the Company shall issue or sell, or is deemed by
the express provisions of this Section 4(d) to have issued or sold, after the date upon which this
Restated Certificate of Incorporation is accepted for filing by the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware (the “Filing Date”) any Additional Stock (as defined below) without consideration
or for a consideration per share less than the Series A Conversion Price and/or Series A-]
Conversion Price, as applicable, in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional
Stock (other than pursuant to Section 4(e)), the Series A Conversion Price and/or Series A-1
Conversion Price, as applicable, in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall forthwith
(except as otherwise provided in this clause (i)) be adjusted to a price determined by multiplying
such Series A Conversion Price and/or Series A-1 Conversion Price, as applicable, by a fraction,
(x) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to such issuance (including shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued
pursuant to subsection 4(d)(i)(E)(1) or (2)) plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the
aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for such issuance would purchase at such
then-existing Series A Conversion Price and/or Series A-! Conversion Price, as applicable; and
(y) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to such issuance (including Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued
pursuant to subsection 4(d)(i)(E)(1) or (2)) plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock.

(B) No adjustment of the Series A Conversion Price or
Series A-1 Conversion Price shall be made in an amount less than one cent per share, provided
that any adjustments that are not required to be made by reason of this sentence shall be carried
forward and shall be either taken into account in any subsequent adjustment made prior to three
years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward, or shall be
made at the end of three years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being
carried forward. Except to the limited extent provided for in subsections 4(d)(i)(E)(3) and
4(d)(i)(E)(4), no adjustment of such Series A Conversion Price and/or Series A-1 Conversion
Price pursuant to this subsection 4(d)(i) shall have the effect of increasing the Series A
Conversion Price above the Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such
adjustment or of increasing the Series A-1 Conversion Price above the Series A-1 Conversion
Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment.

(C) In the case of the issuance of Common Stock for
cash, the consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting
any reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the
Corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

(D) In the case of the issuance of Common Stock for a
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be
deemed to be the fair value thereof as determined by the Board of Directors irrespective of any
accounting treatment.

(E) In the case of the issuance (whether before, on or
after the Filing Date) of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common Stock, securities
by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock or options to purchase or
rights to subscribe for such convertible or exchangeable securities, the following provisions shall
apply for all purposes of this subsection 4(d):

(1) The aggregate maximum number of shares
of Common Stock deliverable upon exercise (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to
exercisability, including without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account
potential antidilution adjustments) of such options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common
Stock shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such options or rights were issued and for
a consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in subsections
4(d)(i(C) and 4(d)(i)(D)), if any, received by the Corporation upon the issuance of such options
or rights plus the minimum exercise price provided in such options or rights (without taking into
account potential antidilution adjustments) for the Common Stock covered thereby.

(2) The aggregate maximum number of shares
of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of, or in exchange (assuming the satisfaction of
any conditions to convertibility or exchangeability, including without limitation, the passage of
time, but without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) for, any such convertible
or exchangeable securities or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for

10.
such convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof, shall
be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or such options or rights
were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration, if any, received by the
Corporation for any such securities and related options or rights (excluding any cash received on
account of accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the minimum additional consideration, if
any, to be received by the Corporation (without taking into account potential antidilution
adjustments) upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or the exercise of any related
options or rights (the consideration in each case to be determined in the manner provided in
subsections 4(d){i)(C) and 4(d)(@)(D)).

(3) In the event of any change in the number of
shares of Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon
exercise of such options or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such convertible or
exchangeable securities (unless such options or rights or convertible or exchangeable securities
were merely deemed to be included in the numerator and denominator for purposes of
determining the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding for purposes of subsection
4(d)(i)(A)), the Series A Conversion Price and/or Series A-1 Conversion Price, to the extent in
any way affected by or computed using such options, rights or securities, shall be recomputed to
reflect such change, but no further adjustment shall be made for the actual issuance of Common
Stock or any payment of such consideration upon the exercise of any such options or rights or
the conversion or exchange of such securities.

(4) | Upon the expiration of any such options or
rights, the termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options
or rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Series A Conversion Price
and/or Series A-! Conversion Price, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such
options, rights or securities or options or rights related to such securities (unless such options or
rights were merely deemed to be included in the numerator and denominator for purposes of
determining the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding for purposes of subsection
4(d){i)(A)), shall be recomputed to reflect the issuance of only the number of shares of Common
Stock (and convertible or exchangeable securities that remain in effect) actually issued upon the
exercise of such options or rights, upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or upon the
exercise of the options or rights related to such securities.

(5) The number of shares of Common Stock
deemed issued and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to subsections 4(d)(i)(E)(1)
and 4(d)(i)(E)(2) shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or expiration
of the type described in either subsection 4(d)(i)(E)(3) or 4(d)G)(E)(4).

(ii) For the purposes of this Section 4(d), “Additional Stock”
shall mean any shares of Common Stock issued (or deemed to have been issued pursuant to
subsection 4(d)(i)(E)) by the Corporation after the Filing Date other than:

(A) Common Stock issued pursuant to a transaction
described in subsection 4(e) hereof;

11.
(B) Common Stock and/or options, warrants or other
Common Stock purchase rights issued to employees, officers or directors of, or consultants or
advisors to, the Company or any subsidiary pursuant to stock purchase or stock option plans or
other incentive or compensatory arrangements that are approved by the Board of Directors;

(C) Capital stock, or options or warrants to purchase
capital stock, issued to financial institutions or lessors in connection with commercial credit
arrangements, equipment financings, commercial property lease transactions or similar
transactions, the principal purpose of which is other than primarily equity financing, provided, in
each case, that such issuance is approved by the Board of Directors of the Corporation;

issuable upon exercise of options or warrants outstanding as of the date of filing of this Second
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation;

manufacture of the Corporation’s products or services, the principal purpose of which is other
than primarily equity financing, provided, in each case, that such issuance is approved by the
Board of Directors of the Corporation.

(e) Adjustment for Stock Splits, Subdivisions, Dividends,
Distributions and Combinations. If the Company, at any time after the Filing Date, makes or
fixes a record date for the effectuation of a split or subdivision of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock or the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive a dividend
or other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock or other securities or rights
convertible into, or entitling the holder thereof to receive directly or indirectly, additional shares
of Common Stock (hereinafter referred to as “Common Stock Equivalents”) without payment
of any consideration by such holder for the additional shares of Common Stock or the Common
Stock Equivalents (including the additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion
or exercise thereof), then, as of such record date (or the date of such dividend distribution, split

12.
or subdivision if no record date is fixed), the Series A Conversion Price and the Series A-]
Conversion Price shall be appropriately decreased so that the number of shares of Common
Stock issuable on conversion of each share of Series A Preferred and Series A-1 Preferred shall
be increased in proportion to such increase of the aggregate of shares of Common Stock
outstanding and those issuable with respect to such Common Stock Equivalents with the number
of shares issuable with respect to Common Stock Equivalents determined from time to time in
the manner provided for deemed issuances in subsection 4(d)(i)(E). If the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding at any time after the Filing Date is decreased by a combination of
the outstanding shares of Common Stock, then, following the record date of such combination,
the Series A Conversion Price and Series A-1 Conversion Price shall be appropriately increased
so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such
series shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares.

(f) Other Distributions. In the event this Corporation shall declare a
distribution payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by this
corporation or other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred
to in subsection 4(e), then, in each such case for the purpose of this subsection 4(f), the holders
of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any such distribution as though
they were the holders of the number of shares of Common Stock of this Corporation into which
their shares of Preferred Stock are convertible as of the record date fixed for the determination of
the holders of Common Stock of this Corporation entitled to receive such distribution.

(g) Recapitalizations and Reorganizations; Adjustment of
Conversion Price.

(i) If at any time after the Filing Date, there is a
recapitalization or reorganization of the Common Stock (other than an Acquisition or Asset
Transfer as defined in Section 3(b) or a stock split, subdivision, dividend, distribution or
combination provided for elsewhere in this Section 4), as a part of such recapitalization or
reorganization, provision shall be made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock so effected
shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of such Preferred Stock the number of
shares of stock or other securities or property of the Company to which a holder of the number of
shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled on such
recapitalization or reorganization, subject to adjustment in respect of such stock or securities by
the terms thereof. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of
the provisions of this Section 4 with respect to the rights of the holders of Series A Preferred and
Series A-1 Preferred after the recapitalization or reorganization to the end that the provisions of
this Section 4 (including adjustment of the Series A Conversion Price and Series A-] Conversion
Price then in effect and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred
and Series A-1 Preferred) shall be applicable after that event and be as nearly equivalent as
practicable.

(ii) On March 17, 2005, the Company participated in a
reorganization transaction in which a wholly owned subsidiary of Allposters.com, Inc. merged
with and into the Company (the “Reorganization”). In connection with the Reorganization,
certain holders of then-outstanding shares of common stock of Allposters.com, Inc. and certain

13.
holders of then-oustanding shares of common stock of the Company agreed to certain indemnity
provisions (the “Indemnity Provisions”) pursuant to (A) that certain Agreement and Plan of
Merger dated as of February 28, 2005, by and among the Company, Allposters.com, Inc. and
certain shareholders of both companies (among others), and (B) that certain Escrow Agreement
dated as of March 16, 2005, by and among the Company, Allposters.com, Inc. and certain
shareholders of both companies (among others). If at any time after the Filing Date, any shares
of common stock of Allposters.com, Inc. issued prior to the Reorganization (“Pre-Reorg
Common,” which includes for purposes of this clause any securities or other property into which
such Pre-Reorg Common has been converted or exchanged) are surrendered back to the
Company for cancellation as a result of a claim of indemnity against AllPosters.com, Inc.
pursuant to the Indemnity Provisions (an “Allposters.com Surrender”), the then-effective
Series A Conversion Price will be adjusted by multiplying it by the percentage resulting from
dividing (i) the number of shares of Pre-Reorg Common that were held immediately after the
Reorganization by the stockholders whose shares are being surrendered, minus any shares of Pre-
Reorg Common surrendered in a prior Allposters.com Surrender by the stockholders who held
Pre-Reorg Common immediately after the Reorganization by (ii) the number of shares of Pre-
Reorg Common referred to in the preceding clause minus the number of shares of Pre-Reorg
Common that are surrendered by those same stockholders in the Allposters.com Surrender.
Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, under no circumstance shall the Series A
Conversion Price be increased pursuant to this Section 4(g)(ii) by more than a cumulative
amount equal to $0.1816, regardless of the number of adjustments to the Series A Conversion
Price made pursuant to this Section 4(g)(ii).

(iii) If at any time after the Filing Date, any shares of common
stock of AllPosters.com, Inc. issued in the Reorganization (“Reorg Common,” which includes
for purposes of this clause any securities or other property into which such Reorg Common has
been converted or exchanged) are surrendered back to the Company for cancellation as a result
of a claim of indemnity against the stockholders of the Company at the time of such
Reorganization pursuant to the Indemnity Provisions (an “Art.com Stockholder Surrender”),
the then-effective Series A-1 Conversion Price will be adjusted by multiplying it by the
percentage resulting from dividing (i) the number of shares of Reorg Common that were held
immediately after the Reorganization by the stockholders whose shares are being surrendered,
minus any shares of Reorg Common surrendered in a prior Art.com Stockholder Surrender by
the stockholders who held Reorg Common immediately after the Reorganization by (ii) the
number of shares of Reorg Common in the preceding clause minus the number of shares of
Reorg Common held by those same stockholders that are surrendered in the Art.com Stockholder
Surrender. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, under no circumstance shall the Series
A-I Conversion Price be increased pursuant to this Section 4(g)(iii) by more than a cumulative
amount equal to $0.1677, regardless of the number of adjustments to the Series A-1 Conversion
Price made pursuant to this Section 4(g)(iii).

(h) Certificate of Adjustment. In each case of an adjustment
or readjustment of the Series A Conversion Price or Series A-1 Conversion Price for the number
of shares of Common Stock or other securities issuable upon conversion of the Series A
Preferred or Series A-1 Preferred, to the extent shares of such series are then convertible

14.
pursuant to this Section 4, the Company, at its expense, shall promptly compute such adjustment
or readjustment in accordance with the provisions hereof and prepare a certificate showing such
adjustment or readjustment, and shall mail such certificate, by first class mail, postage prepaid, to
each registered holder of Series A Preferred or Series A-1 Preferred, as the case may be, at the
holder’s address as shown in the Company’s books. The certificate shall set forth such
adjustment or readjustment, showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or
readjustment is based, including a statement of (i) the consideration received or deemed to be
received by the Company for any Additional Stock issued or sold or deemed to have been issued
or sold, (ii) the applicable Series A Conversion Price or Series A-1 Conversion Price, as the case
may be, at the time in effect, (iii) the number of shares of Additional Stock and (iv) the type and
amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon conversion of the
Preferred Stock. In addition, this Corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any
holder of Series A Preferred or Series A-1] Preferred, furnish or cause to be furnished to such
holder a like certificate setting forth (A) any. adjustments and readjustments to the Series A
Conversion Price or the Series A-1 Conversion Price, as applicable, (B) the Series A Preferred
Conversion Price or Series A-1 Conversion Price, as applicable, then time in effect, and (C) the
number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property that at the time
would be received upon the conversion of a share of Series A Preferred or Series A-1 Preferred.

(i) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall
be issued upon conversion of any share or shares of Preferred Stock. All shares of Common
Stock (including fractions thereof) issuable upon conversion of more than one share of Preferred
Stock by a holder thereof shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the
conversion would result in the issuance of any fractional share. If, after the aforementioned
aggregation, the conversion would result in the issuance of any fractional share, the Company
shall, in lieu of issuing any fractional share, pay cash equal to the product of such fraction
multiplied by the Common Stock’s fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors)
on the date of conversion.

(j) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Company
shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common
Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock,
such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock. If at any time the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, in addition to such other remedies as shall
be available to the holder of such Preferred Stock, the Company will take such corporate action
as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares
of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose, including,
without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any
necessary amendment to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

(k) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Section 4 to
be given to the holders of shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed given upon receipt or, if
earlier, (a) five days after deposit with the U.S. Postal Service or other applicable postal service,
if delivered by first class mail, postage prepaid; (b) upon delivery, if delivered by hand; (c) one

15.
business day after the business day of deposit with Federal Express or similar overnight courier,
freight prepaid; or (d) one business day after the business day of facsimile transmission (with
confirmation), if delivered by facsimile transmission with copy by first class mail, postage
prepaid, and shall be addressed to each holder of record at such holder’s address appearing on
the books of the Corporation.

(1) Payment of Taxes. The Company will pay all taxes (other than
taxes based upon income, capital gains or similar taxes) and other governmental charges that
may be imposed with respect to the issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon
conversion of shares of Preferred Stock, excluding any tax or other charge imposed in
connection with any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a
name other than that in which the shares of Preferred Stock so converted were registered.

(m) No Dilution or Impairment. Without the consent of the requisite
holders of then outstanding Preferred Stock as required under Section 2 and applicable law, the
Company shall not amend its Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or
participate in any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or
sale of securities or take any other voluntary action, for the purpose of avoiding or seeking to
avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder
by the Company, but shall at all times in good faith assist in carrying out all such action as may
be reasonably necessary or appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holders of
the Preferred Stock against dilution or other impairment.

(n) Notices of Record Date. In the event of any taking by this
Corporation of a record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining
the holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend) or other
distribution, this Corporation shall mail to each holder of Preferred Stock, at least ten (10) days
prior to the date specified therein, a notice specifying the date on which any such record is to be
taken for the purpose of such dividend or distribution, and the amount and character of such
dividend or distribution.

5. No REISSUANCE OF PREFERRED STOCK.

In the event any shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted pursuant to
Section 4 hereof, the shares so converted shall be cancelled and shall not be issuable by the
Company, and this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall be
appropriately amended to effect the corresponding reduction in this corporation’s authorized
capital stock
