determined by dividing the applicable Original Issue Price by the applicable Conversion Price,
determined as hereinafter provided, in effect at the time of conversion. The initial Conversion
MAR-18-2669 17:7 PHS CORP SERVICES She 77? 6595 P.4816

Price with respect to each share of Series A-l Preferred shall be $28.992981. The initial
Conversion Price with respect to each share of Series B-1 Preferred shall be the Original Issue
Price of the Series B-1 Preferred. The initial Conversion Price with respect to each share of Series

with respect to each share of Series D Preferred shall be the Original Issue Price of the Series D
Preferred. The Conversion Prices with respect to Series Preferred shall be subject to adjustment as
hereinafter provided, as applicable.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Series Preferred shall automatically be
converted into shares of Common Stock at the then applicable Conversion Price upon the earlier of
(i) the closing of a firm commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, covering the offer and sale of
Common Stock to the public which results in total cash proceeds to the Corporation (before
underwriters’ commissions and expenses) of at least $30,000,000 (a “Qualified Public Offering”)
or (ii) the affirmative vote of the holders of 60% of the outstanding shares of Senior Preferred,
voting together as a separate single class on an as-converted basis. In addition, each share of Series
A-1 Preferred shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the then applicable
Conversion Price upon the affirmative vote of the holders of 75% of the (i) outstanding shares of
Series A-1 Preferred and (ii) shares of Common Stock issued to such holders of Series A-1
Preferred pursuant to the Series B-] Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of December 15,

conversion, any declared and unpaid dividends shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of
Section 4(c) below. Upon such automatic conversion, any declared and unpaid dividends shall be
paid in accordance with the provisions of Section 4(c) below.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be
issued upon conversion of the Series Preferred. All shares of Common Stock (including fractions
thereof) issuable upon conversion of more than one share of Series Preferred by a holder thereof
shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the conversion would result in the
issuance of any fractional share. If, after the aforementioned aggregation, the conversion would
result in the issuance of any fractional share, the Corporation shall, in lieu of issuing any fractional
share, pay to such holder cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair market value of one
share of Common Stock (as determined by the Board) on the date of conversion,

(i) Subject to clause (ii) below, before any holder of Series Preferred
shall be entitled to convert the same into full shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender
the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or any transfer
agent for the Series Preferred, and shall give written notice to the Corporation at such office that
the holder elects to convert the same. Such notice shall also state whether the holder elects to
receive in cash any declared but unpaid dividends on the Series Preferred proposed to be converted,
or to convert such dividends into shares of Common Stock at their fair market value as determined
by the Board. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such
office to such holder of Series Preferred (1) a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of
Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid, (2) a check payable to such
holder in the amount of any cash amounts payable as a result of the conversion of any shares of
Series Preferred into fractional shares of Common Stock, and, if such holder elects not to convert
unpaid dividends into Common Stock, all declared and unpaid dividends on such holder's
converted Series Preferred and, (3) if less than all of the shares of the Preferred Stock represented
by such certificate are converted into Common Stock, a certificate representing the shares of Series
MAR-18-2669 17:66 PHS CORP SERVICES She 77? 6595 P.4916

Preferred not converted into Common Stock. In the event of any conversion at the election of a
holder of Series Preferred, such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior
to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Series Preferred to be
converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon
such conversion shal] be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of
Common Stock on such date.

(ii) ‘If the conversion is pursuant to Section 4{b)(i) above, the conversion
shall be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriter of the sale of securities pursuant to such
offering, in which event the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such
conversion of the Series Preferred shall not be deemed to have converted such Series Preferred
until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities. Notice of such conversion shall be
given by the Corporation by mail, postage pre-paid, to the holders of the Series Preferred at their
addresses shown in the Corporation’s records, within a reasonable time after the closing date of the
Qualified Public Offering. Promptly after the closing date of the Qualified Public Offering
specified in such notice, each holder of Series Preferred shall surrender the certificate or certificates
representing such holder’s shares of Series Preferred for the number of shares of Common Stock to
which such holder is entitled, at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for the
applicable series of Series Preferred. Upon surrendering such shares each holder of Series
Preferred shall deliver a notice to the Corporation that shall state whether the holder elects to
receive in cash any declared but unpaid dividends on the Preferred Stock to be converted, or to
convert such dividends into shares of Common Stock at their fair market value as determined by
the Board. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office
to such holder of Preferred Stock (1) a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of
Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid, and (2) a check payable to the
holder in the amount of any cash amounts payable as a result of the conversion of any shares of
Series Preferred into fractional shares of Common Stock, and, if such holder elects not to convert
unpaid dividends into Common Stock, all declared and unpaid dividends on such holder’s
converted Series Preferred. Notwithstanding that any certificate representing the Series Preferred
to be converted shall not have been surrendered, each holder of such Series Preferred shall
thereafter be treated for all purposes as the record holder of the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable to such holder upon such conversion, assuming that such holder had elected to convert all
declared or accrued but unpaid dividends on its Series Preferred into Common Stock.

(d)} Adjustment of Conversion Price. The Conversion Price of each series of
Series Preferred shall be subject to adjustment as follows:

(i) Adjustments for Subdivision, Combinations or Consolidations of

Common Stock. In the event that on or after the date that the first share of Series D Preferred is
issued (the “Original Issue Date”), the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided
or increased (by stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or otherwise) into a preater number of
shares of Common Stock, and no equivalent subdivision or increase is made with respect to the
Series Preferred, the respective Conversion Price then in effect for each series of Series Preferred
shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such subdivision or increase, be proportionately
decreased. In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined or
consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, the
respective Conversion Price then in effect for each series of Series Preferred shall, concurrently
with the effectiveness of such combination or consolidation, be proportionately increased.
MAR-18-2669 17°86 PHS CORP SERVICES aH2 77? 6595 P.1616

(ii) Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. In the event
that on or after the Original Issue Date, the Corporation pays a dividend or other distribution in

securities of the Corporation to holders of Common Stock, and no equivalent dividend or other
distribution is made to the holders of Series Preferred, then and in each such event provision shall
be made so that the holders of each series of Series Preferred shall receive, concurrently therewith,
the amount of such securities which they would have received had their Series Preferred been
converted into Common Stock on the date of such event. If the Company fixes a record date to
determine which holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive such dividend or other
distribution, the Conversion Prices with respect to the Series Preferred shall be fixed as of the close
of business on such record date and the number of shares of Common Stock shall be calculated
immediately prior to the close of business on such record date.

(iii) Adjustments for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. In
the event that on or after the Original Issue Date, the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of

the Series Preferred shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of any other
class or classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than
a subdivision or combination of shares provided for above), and no equivalent capital
reorganization, reclassification or other change is made with respect to the Series Preferred, the
respective Conversion Price then in effect for each series of Series Preferred shal], concurrently
with the effectiveness of such reorganization or reclassification, be proportionately adjusted such
that each series of Series Preferred shall be convertible into, in lieu of the number of shares of
Common Stock which the holders thereof would otherwise have been entitled to receive, a number
of shares of such other class or classes of stock equivalent to the number of shares of Common
Stock that would have been subject to receipt by the holders thereof upon conversion of the Series
Preferred immediately before such change.

(e) Adjustments to Conversion Price of the Senior Preferred for Certain Dilutive
Issues. The Conversion Price of the Senior Preferred only shall be subject to adjustment as

follows:

or deemed to be issued by the Corporation is less than the applicable Conversion Price of the
Senior Preferred in effect on the date of, and immediately prior to, such issuance.

(iii) Deemed Issuance of Additional Shares of Common. In the event
the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall issue any
Options or Convertible Securities or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of any

contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) of Common Stock issuable upon the
exercise of such Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities and options therefor, the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to be Additional Shares of
Common issued as of the time of such issue, or in the case such a record date shall have been fixed,
as of the close of business on such record date; provided that Additional Shares of Common shall
not be deemed to have been issued unless the consideration per share (determined pursuant to
Section 4(e)(v) hereof) of such Additional Shares of Common would be less than the applicable
Conversion Price of the Senior Preferred in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such
issue, or such record date, as the case may be; and provided further that in any such case in which
Additional Shares of Common are deemed to be issued:

(A) except as provided in clause (B) below, no further
adjustment in the Conversion Price of the Senior Preferred shall be made upon the subsequent issue
of Convertible Securities or shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of such Options or
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities;

(B) if such Options or Convertible Securities by their
terms provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any increase in the consideration payable
to the Corporation, or decrease in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable, upon the
exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, the Conversion Price computed upon the original issue
thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent
adjustments based thereon, shall, upon any such increase or decrease becoming effective, be
recomputed to reflect such increase or decrease insofar as it affects such Options or the rights of
conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities;

(C) upon the expiration of any such Options or any rights
of conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have been exercised,
the Conversion Price computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record
date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon such
expiration, be recomputed as if:

(a) in the case of Convertible Securities or Options
for Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common issued were shares of Common Stock,
if any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities and the consideration received therefor was the consideration actually
received by the Corporation for the issue of all such Options, whether or not exercised, plus the
consideration actually received by the Corporation upon such exercise, or for the issue of al! such
Convertible Securities which were actually converted or exchanged, plus the additional
consideration, if any, actually received by the Corporation upon such conversion or exchange; and

(b) in the case of Options for Convertible
Securities, only the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were
issued at the time of issue of such Options, and the consideration received by the Corporation for
the Additional Shares of Common deemed to have been then issued was the consideration actually
received by the Corporation for the issuance of all such Options, whether or not exercised, plus the
consideration deemed to have been received by the Corporation upon the issue of the Convertible
Securities with respect to which such Options were actually exercised;

(D) no readjustment pursuant to clause (B) or (C) above
shall have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price to an amount which exceeds the Jower of (i)
the Conversion Price on the original adjustment date or (ii) the Conversion Price that would have
resulted from any issuance of Additional Shares of Common between the original adjustment date
and such readjustment date; and

(E) in the case of any Options which expire by their terms
not more than 30 days after the date of issue thereof, no adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be
made unti] the expiration or exercise of all such Options, whereupon such adjustments shall be
made in the same manner provided in clause (C) above.

(iv) Adjustment of Conversion Price of the Senior Preferred Upon

Issuance of Additional Shares of Common, Jn the event the Corporation shall issue Additional
Shares of Common after the Original Issue Date (including Additional Shares of Common deemed
MAR-18-2669 17:18 PHS CORP SERVICES She 77? 6595 P.1316

to be issued pursuant to Section 4(e)(iii)) without consideration or for a consideration per share less
than the applicable Conversion Price of the Senior Preferred then in effect immediately prior to
such issue, then and in such event, the applicable Conversion Price of the Senior Preferred shall be
reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest cent) determined by
multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue, plus the number of shares of
Common Stock which the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for the total number
of Additional Shares of Common so issued would purchase at such Conversion Price, and the
denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to such issue, plus the number of such Additional Shares of Common so issued; provided that
for the purposes of such reduction all shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of all
outstanding Options and upon conversion of outstanding Convertible Securities shall be deemed to
be outstanding, and immediately after any Additional Shares of Common are deemed issued
pursuant to Section 4(e)(iii), such Additional Shares of Common shall be deemed to be
outstanding.

(v) Determination of Consideration, For purposes of this Section 4(e),
the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional Shares of Common
shall be computed as follows:

(1) Cash and Property: Such consideration shall:

(A) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the net
amount of cash received by the Corporation excluding expenses, discounts and commissions
payable by the Corporation in connection with such issuance or sale and amounts paid or payable
for accrued interest;

(B) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith by the
Board net of expenses as set forth in clause (A) above; and

(C) in the event Additional Shares of Common are issued
together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for consideration which
covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in clauses
(A) and (B) above, as determined in good faith by the Board.

(2) Options and Convertible Securities, The consideration per
share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common deemed to have been issued

pursuant to Section 4(e)(iii), relating to Options and Convertible Securities, shall be determined by
dividing:

(x) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the
Corporation as consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the
minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating
thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such
consideration) payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the
exercise of such options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities, by

{y) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as
MAR-18-2669 17:18 PHS CORP SERVICES She 77? 6595 P.1416

set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a
subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the

of such Convertible Securities.

all outstanding shares of Series Preferred, and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding
shares of the Series Preferred, in addition to such other remedies as shall be available to the holder
of such Series Preferred, the Corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the option of its
counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such
number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in
