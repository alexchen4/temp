the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, (a) each one (1) issued or outstanding share of
Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, automatically and without any action on the part of
the respective holders thereof, shall combine into one-fourth (0.25) of a share of Common Stock,
par value $0.001 per share; (b) each one (1) issued or outstanding share of Series A Preferred

one (1) such share on the date of the Reverse Stock Split, as determined in good faith by the

preferences or privileges on parity with or senior to the Series A-1 Preferred; provided, however,
that in the event of a bona fide financing (A) at an equity valuation for the entire Company of at
least $200 million prior to the financing, and (B) where the equity securities issued in such
financing (1) have a liquidation preference no more favorable than one times the original
purchase price, payable pari passu with the Series A-1 Preferred, with no limit on participation

(d) Election of Board of Directors.

(i) For so long as at least 10,000,000 shares of Series A-1
Preferred remain outstanding (subject to adjustment for any stock dividends, combination, splits,
recapitalizations and the like affecting the Series Preferred after the filing date hereof), the
holders of Series A-1 Preferred, voting as a separate class, shall be entitled to elect one (1)
member of the Board at each meeting or pursuant to each consent of the Company’s stockholders
for the election of directors, and to remove from office such director and to fill any vacancy
caused by the resignation, death or removal of such director.

(ii) —- For so long as at least 10,000,000 shares of Series A-2
Preferred remain outstanding (subject to adjustment for any stock dividends, combination, splits,
recapitalizations and the like affecting the Series Preferred after the filing date hereof), the
holders of Series A-2 Preferred, voting as a separate class, shall be entitled to elect two (2)
members of the Board at each meeting or pursuant to each consent of the Company’s
stockholders for the election of directors, and to remove from office such directors and to fill any
vacancy caused by the resignation, death or removal of such directors.

(iii) The holders of Common Stock, voting as a separate class,
shall be entitled to elect two (2) members of the Board at each meeting or pursuant to each
consent of the Company’s stockholders for the election of directors, and to remove from office
such directors and to fill any vacancy caused by the resignation, death or removal of such
directors.

(iv) No person entitled to vote at an election for directors may
cumulate votes to which such person is entitled, unless, at the time of such election, the
Company is subject to Section 2115 of the California Corporations Code (“CCC”). During such
time or times that the Company is subject to Section 2115(b) of the CCC, every stockholder
entitled to vote at an election for directors may cumulate such stockholder’s votes and give one
candidate a number of votes equal to the number of directors to be elected multiplied by the
number of votes to which such stockhoider’s shares are otherwise entitled, or distribute the
stockholder’s votes on the same principle among as many candidates as such stockholder desires.
No stockholder, however, shall be entitled to so cumulate such stockholder’s votes unless (i) the
names of such candidate or candidates have been placed in nomination prior to the voting and (ii)
the stockholder has given notice at the meeting, prior to the voting, of such stockholder’s
intention to cumulate such stockholder’s votes. If any stockholder has given proper notice to
cumulate votes, all stockholders may cumulate their votes for any candidates who have been
properly placed in nomination. Under cumulative voting, the candidates receiving the highest
number of votes, up to the number of directors to be elected, are elected.

(v) During such time or times that the Company is subject to
Section 2115(b) of the CCC, one or more directors may be removed from office at any time
without cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding
shares entitled to vote for that director as provided above; provided, however, that unless the
entire Board is removed, no individual director may be removed when the votes cast against such
director’s removal, or not consenting in writing to such removal, would be sufficient to elect that
director if voted cumulatively at an election which the same total number of votes were cast (or,
if such action is taken by written consent, all shares entitled to vote were voted) and the entire
number of directors authorized at the time of such director’s most recent election were then being
elected.

3. LIQUIDATION RIGHTS.

(a) Series A-1 Preferred. Upon any liquidation, dissolution, or
winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary (a “Liquidation Event”), before

the assets of the Company legally available for distribution, including the consideration received
in such transaction or Acquisition or Asset Transfer (as such terms are defined in Section 4

shall be distributed among the holders of Series A-1 Preferred at the time outstanding, ratably in
proportion to the full amounts to which they would otherwise be respectively entitled.

(b) Series A-2 Preferred. After the payment of the full liquidation
preference set forth in Section 3(a) above, the holders of Series A-2 Preferred shall be entitled to

consideration received in such transaction or Acquisition or Asset Transfer, for each share of
Series A-2 Preferred then held by them, an amount per share equal to the quotient of (i)
$45,000,000, divided by (ii) the total number of shares of Series A-2 outstanding at the time of
such Liquidation Event, Acquisition or Asset Transfer, as applicable, plus all declared and
unpaid dividends on the Series A-2 Preferred. If, upon any such Liquidation Event, the assets of
the Company (including the consideration received in the Acquisition or Asset Transfer) shall be
insufficient to make payment in full to all holders of Series A-2 Preferred of the liquidation
preference set forth in this Section 3(b), then such assets shall be distributed ratably among the
holders of Series A-2 Preferred in proportion to the number of shares of Series A-2 Preferred at
the time outstanding.

(c) Prior Series Preferred. After the payment of the full liquidation
preferences set forth in Section 3(a) and 3{b) above, the holders of Prior Series Preferred shall be
entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Company legally available for distribution, including

amount per share of Prior Series Preferred equal to their applicable Original Issue Price plus all
declared and unpaid dividends on the Prior Series Preferred. If, upon any such Liquidation
Event, the assets of the Company (including the consideration recetved in the Acquisition or
Asset Transfer) shall be insufficient to make payment in full to all holders of the Prior Series

distributed among the holders of Prior Series Preferred at the time outstanding, ratably in
proportion to the full amounts to which they would otherwise be respectively entitled.

(d) Participation. After the payment of the full liquidation preferences
set forth in Sections 3(a), 3(b) and 3(c) above, the assets of the Company legally available for
distribution in such Liquidation Event (including the consideration received by the Company or
its stockholders in such Acquisition or Asset Transfer), if any, shall be distributed ratably to the
holders of the Common Stock, the Prior Series Preferred, the Series A-1 Preferred and the Series
A-2 Preferred Stock on an as-if-converted to Common Stock basis, provided, however, that:

(i) with respect to the Series A-1 Preferred, each holder of
Series A-1 Preferred shall not receive pursuant to Section 3(a) above and this Section 3(d) an
aggregate amount per share of Series A-1 Preferred that is greater than the sum of $2.20172 (as
adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like with respect
to the Series A-1 Preferred after the filing date hereof) (the “Series A-1 Liquidation Amount”)
plus an amount equal to all declared and unpaid dividends on such share of Series A-] Preferred;

(ii) with respect to the Series A-2 Preferred, each holder of
Series A-2 Preferred shall not receive pursuant to Section 3(b) above and this Section 3(d) an
ageregate amount per share of Series A-2 Preferred that is greater than the sum of $2.20172 (as

to the Series A-2 Preferred after the filing date hereof) (the “Series A-2 Liquidation Amount”),
plus an amount equal to all declared and unpaid dividends on such share of Series A-2 Preferred;

(ili) — with respect to the Series A Preferred, each holder of Series
A Preferred shall not receive pursuant to Section 3(c) above and this Section 3(d) an aggregate
amount per share of Series A Preferred that is greater than the sum of three (3) times the Original
Issue Price of the Series A Preferred plus an amount equal to all declared and unpaid dividends
on such share of Series A Preferred;

(iv) with respect to the Series B Preferred, each holder of Series

Issue Price of the Series B Preferred plus an amount equal to all declared and unpaid dividends

(v) with respect to the Series C Preferred, each holder of Series
C Preferred shall not receive pursuant to Section 3(c) above and this Section 3(d) an aggregate
amount per share of Series C Preferred that is greater than the sum of three (3) times the Original
Issue Price of the Series C Preferred plus an amount equal to all declared and unpaid dividends

(vi) | with respect to the Series D Preferred, each holder of Series
D Preferred shall not receive pursuant to Section 3(c) above and this Section 3(d) an aggregate

on such share of Series D Preferred.

Thereafter, the remaining assets of the Company legally available for distribution in such
Liquidation Event (including the consideration received in such transaction or Acquisition or
Asset Transfer), if any, shall be distributed ratably to the holders of the Common Stock.

{e) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) through (d) above, solely for
purposes of determining the amount each holder of shares of a series of Preferred Stock is
entitled to receive with respect to a Liquidation Event, Acquisition or Asset Transfer, the holder
of each share of such series of Preferred Stock shall be treated as if such holder had converted
such holder’s shares of such series into shares of Common Stock immediately prior to the
Liquidation Event, Acquisition or Asset Transfer if, as a result of an actual conversion of the
entire such series of Preferred Stock (including taking into account the operation of this
paragraph (e) with respect to such series), each holder of such series would receive (with respect
to the shares of such series), in the aggregate, an amount greater than the amount that would be
distributed to holders of such series (with respect to the shares of such series) if such holders had
not converted such series into shares of Common Stock. If holders of any series are treated as if
they had converted shares of Preferred Stock into Common Stock pursuant to this paragraph,
then such holders shall not be entitled to receive any distribution pursuant to Sections 3(a), 3(b),
3(c) and 3(d) that would otherwise be made to holders of such series of Preferred Stock, but
instead shall receive the amount calculated as provided in this paragraph (e).

4, ASSET TRANSFER OR ACQUISITION RIGHTS.

(a) In the event that the Company is a party to an Acquisition or Asset
Transfer (as hereinafter defined), then such transaction shall be deemed a Liquidation Event
under Section 3 and each holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, for each share of
Preferred Stock then held, out of the proceeds of such Acquisition or Asset Transfer together
with all other assets of the Company legally available for distribution, the amount of cash,
securities or other property to which such holder would be entitled to receive in a Liquidation
Event pursuant to (i) Sections 3(a), 3(b) and 3(c) above, or (ii) Section 3(d) above.

(b) For the purposes of this Section 4: (i) “Acquisition” shall mean (A)
any consolidation or merger of the Company with or into any other corporation or other entity or
person, or any other corporate reorganization, in which the capital stock of the Company
immediately prior to such consolidation, merger or reorganization, represents less than 50% of
the voting power of the surviving entity (or, if the surviving entity is a wholly owned subsidiary,
less than 50% of the voting power of its parent) immediately after such consolidation, merger or
reorganization; or (B) any transaction or series of related transactions to which the Company is a
party in which in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the Company’s voting power is transferred;
provided that an Acquisition shall not include (x) any consolidation or merger effected
exclusively to change the domicile of the Company, or (y) any transaction or series of
transactions principally for bona fide equity financing purposes in which cash is received by the
Company or any successor or indebtedness of the Company is cancelled or converted or a
combination thereof at fair market value or above, as determined in good faith by the Board on
the date of such determination; and (ii) “Asset Transfer” shall mean a sale, lease, transfer,
exclusive license or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company.

(c) If the amount paid or distributed under this Section 4 and Section
3, above, is made in property other than in cash, the value of such distribution shall be the fair
market value of such property, determined as follows:

(i) For securities not subject to investment letters or other
similar restrictions on free marketability,

(A) if traded on a securities exchange or the NASDAQ
Stock Market, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities
on such exchange or market over the 30-period ending three days prior to the closing of such
transaction;

(B) if actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing bid prices over the 30-day period ending three days prior
to the closing of such transaction; or

(C) if there is no active public market, the value shall be
the fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the
Company.

(ii) The method of valuation of securities subject to investment
letters or other similar restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by
virtue of a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall take into account an
appropriate discount (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company)
from the market value as determined pursuant to clause (i) above so as to reflect the approximate
fair market value thereof.

(d) Inthe event of an Asset Transfer, if the Company does not effect a
dissolution of the Company under the DGCL within 90 days after the closing of such Asset
Transfer, then (1) the Company shall send a written notice to each holder of Series Preferred no
later than the 90th day after the Asset Transfer advising such holders of their right (and the
requirements to be met to secure such right) pursuant to the terms of the following clause (2) to
require the redemption of such shares of Series Preferred, and (2) if the holders of at least a
majority of the then outstanding shares of Series Preferred so request in a written instrument
delivered to the Company not later than 120 days after such Asset Transfer, the Company shall
use the consideration received by the Company for such Asset Transfer (net of any retained
liabilities associated with the assets sold or technology licensed, as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors of the Company), together with any other assets of the Company available
for distribution to its stockholders (the “Available Proceeds”), to the extent legally available
therefor, on the 150th day after such Asset Transfer (the “Redemption Date”), to redeem all
outstanding shares of Series Preferred for the amount of cash, securities or other property which
such holder of Series Preferred would be entitled to receive in a Liquidation Event pursuant to
Sections 3(a), 3(b) and 3(c) or 3(d) above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a
redemption pursuant to the preceding sentence, if the Available Proceeds are not sufficient to
redeem all outstanding shares of Series Preferred or if the Company does not have sufficient
lawfully available funds to effect such redemption, the Company shall redeem the shares of
Series Preferred in accordance with the liquidation preferences set forth in Section 3, above, to
the fullest extent of such Available Proceeds or such lawfully available funds, as the case may be,
and shall redeem the remaining shares to have been redeemed as soon as practicable after the
Company has funds legally available therefor. The provisions of Sections 6(a) through 6(c)
below shall apply to the redemption of the Series Preferred pursuant to this Section 4(d). Prior to
the distribution or redemption provided for in this Section 4(d), the Company shall not expend or
dissipate the consideration received for such Asset Transfer, except to discharge expenses
incurred in connection with such Asset Transfer or in the ordinary course of business.

5. CONVERSION RIGHTS.

The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have the following rights with
respect to the conversion of the Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock (the “Conversion
Rights”):

(a) Optional Conversion. Subject to and in compliance with the
provisions of this Section 5, any shares of Preferred Stock may, at the option of the holder, be
converted at any time into fully-paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock. The number
of shares of Common Stock to which a holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled upon
conversion shall be the product obtained by multiplying the applicable Series Preferred
Conversion Rate then in effect (determined as provided in Section 5(b)) by the number of shares
of Preferred Stock being converted.
(b) Series Preferred Conversion Rate. The conversion rate in effect
at any time for conversion of a series of Preferred Stock (the “Series Preferred Conversion Rate”)
shall be the quotient obtained by dividing the Original Issue Price of such series of Preferred
Stock by the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price, calculated as provided in Section 5{c)
below.

(c) Series Preferred Conversion Price. The conversion price for a
series of Preferred Stock shall initially be the Original Issue Price of such series of Preferred
Stock as specified in Section 1(b) above (the “Series Preferred Conversion Price”). Such initial
applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be adjusted from time to time in accordance
with this Section 5. All references to the Series Preferred Conversion Price of a series herein
shall mean the Series Preferred Conversion Price of such series as so adjusted.

(d) Mechanics of Conversion. Each holder of Preferred Stock who
desires to convert the same into shares of Common Stock pursuant to this Section 5 shall
surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Company or
any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, or notify the Company or its transfer agent that such
certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the
Company to indemnify the Company from any loss incurred by it in connection with such
certificates. Such holder shall give written notice to the Company at such office that such holder
elects to convert the Preferred Stock. Such notice shall state the number of shares of Preferred
Stock being converted. Thereupon, the Company shall promptly issue and deliver at such office
to such holder a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which
such holder is entitled and shall promptly pay (i) in cash or, to the extent sufficient funds are not
then legally available therefor, in Common Stock (at the Common Stock’s fair market value
determined by the Board as of the date of such conversion), any declared and unpaid dividends
on the shares of Preferred Stock being converted and (ii) in cash (at the Common Stock’s fair
market value determined by the Board as of the date of conversion) the value of any fractional
share of Common Stock otherwise issuable to any holder of Preferred Stock. Such conversion
shall be deemed to have been made at the close of business on the date of such surrender of the
certificates representing the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person entitled to
receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all
purposes as the record holder of such shares of Common Stock on such date.

(e) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If at any time
or from time to time after the date that the first share of a series of Preferred Stock was issued,
with respect to such series (the “Original Issue Date” of such series of Preferred Stock) the
Company effects a subdivision of the outstanding Common Stock without a corresponding
subdivision of such series of the Preferred Stock, the Series Preferred Conversion Price of such
series in effect immediately before that subdivision shall be proportionately decreased.
Conversely, if at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date of a series of
Preferred Stock the Company combines the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller
number of shares without a corresponding combination of such series of Preferred Stock, the
Series Preferred Conversion Price in effect for such series of Preferred Stock immediately before
the combination shall be proportionately increased. Any adjustment under this Section 5(e) shall
become effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes
effective.

(f) Adjustment for Common Stock Dividends and Distributions.
If at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date for a series of Preferred Stock the
Company pays to holders of Common Stock a dividend or other distribution in additional shares
of Common Stock without a corresponding dividend or other distribution to holders of such
series of Preferred Stock, the Series Preferred Conversion Price for such series then in effect
shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance, as provided below:

(i) The Series Preferred Conversion Price for such series shall
be adjusted by multiplying the Series Preferred Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction
equal to:

(A) _ the numerator of which is the total number of shares
of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance, and

(B) the denominator of which is the total number of
shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance
plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or
distribution;

(ii) If the Company fixes a record date to determine which
holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution, the Series
Preferred Conversion Price shall be fixed as of the close of business on such record date and the
number of shares of Common Stock shall be calculated immediately prior to the close of
business on such record date; and

(iii) | If such record date is fixed and such dividend is not fully
paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the Series Preferred
Conversion Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record date
and thereafter the Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this Section
5(f) to reflect the actual payment of such dividend or distribution.

(g) Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange, Substitution,
Reorganization, Merger or Consolidation. If at any time or from time to time after the
Original Issue Date for a series of Preferred Stock, the Common Stock issuable upon the
conversion of such series of Preferred Stock is changed into the same or a different number of
shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by recapitalization, reclassification, merger,
consolidation or otherwise (other than an Acquisition or Asset Transfer as defined in Section 4 or
a subdivision or combination of shares or stock dividend or a reorganization, merger,
consolidation or sale of assets provided for elsewhere in this Section 5), in any such event each
holder of such series of Preferred Stock shall then have the right to convert such series of
Preferred Stock into the kind and amount of stock and other securities and property receivable
upon such recapitalization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or other change by holders of
the maximum number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Preferred Stock
could have been converted immediately prior to such recapitalization, reclassification, merger,
consolidation or change, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein or with respect to
such other securities or property by the terms thereof. In any such case, appropriate adjustment
shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 5 with respect to the rights of
the holders of Preferred Stock after such recapitalization, reclassification, merger, consolidation
or other change to the end that the provisions of this Section 5 (including adjustment of the
Series Preferred Conversion Price then in effect and the number of shares issuable upon
conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event and be as nearly equivalent
as practicable.

(h) Sale of Shares Below Series Preferred Conversion Price.

(i) Series A-1 Preferred/Series A-2 Preferred. If at any time
or from time to time after the date hereof, the Company issues or sells, or is deemed by the
express provisions of this Section 5(h) to have issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common
Stock (as defined below), other than as provided in Sections 5(e), 5(f) or 5(g) above, for an
Effective Price (as defined in Section 5(h)(vi) below) less than the then effective Series Preferred
Conversion Price of Series Preferred (a “Series Preferred Qualifying Dilutive Issuance”), then the
then existing Series Preferred Conversion Price for each series of Series Preferred with a Series
Preferred Conversion Price greater than the Effective Price shall be reduced, as of the opening of
business on the date of such issue or sale, to the Effective Price.

(ii) ‘Prior Series Preferred. If at any time or from time to time
after the Original Issue Date for a series of Prior Series Preferred, the Company issues or sells, or
is deemed by the express provisions of this Section 5(h) to have issued or sold, Additional Shares
of Common Stock (as defined below), other than as provided in Sections 5(e), 5(f) or 5(g) above,
for an Effective Price (as defined in Section 5(h)(vi) below) less than the then effective Series
Preferred Conversion Price of such series (a “Prior Series Preferred Qualifying Dilutive
Issuance” and either of a Series Preferred Qualifying Dilutive Issuance or a Prior Series Preferred
Qualifying Dilutive Issuance, a “Qualifying Dilutive Issuance”), then and in each such case, the
then existing Series Preferred Conversion Price for such Prior Series Preferred shall be reduced,
as of the opening of business on the date of such issue or sale, to a price determined by
multiplying the Series Preferred Conversion Price for such series in effect immediately prior to
such issuance or sale by a fraction equal to:

(A) — the numerator of which shall be (A) the number of
shares of Common Stock deemed outstanding (as determined below) immediately prior to such
issue or sale, plus (B) the number of shares of Common Stock which the Aggregate
Consideration (as defined below) received or deemed received by the Company for the total
number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued would purchase at such then-existing
Series Preferred Conversion Price for such series, and

(B) the denominator of which shall be the number of
shares of Common Stock deemed outstanding (as determined below) immediately prior to such
issue or sale plus the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued.
For the purposes of the preceding sentence, the number of shares of Common Stock
deemed to be outstanding as of a given date shall be the sum of (A) the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding, (B) the number of shares of Common Stock into which the then
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock could be converted if fully converted on the day
immediately preceding the given date, and (C) the number of shares of Common Stock that are
issuable upon the exercise or conversion of all other rights, options and convertible securities
outstanding on the day immediately preceding the given date (the “Outstanding Shares”).

(iii) No adjustment shall be made to any Series Preferred
Conversion Price in an amount less than one hundredth of a cent per share, unless such
adjustment, aggregated with previous adjustment(s) of less than one hundredth of a cent per
share, equals or exceeds one hundredth of a cent per share on such series of Preferred Stock.
Any adjustment otherwise required by this Section 5(h) that is not required to be made due to the
preceding sentence shall be included in any subsequent adjustment to the Series Preferred
Conversion Price.

(iv) For the purpose of making any adjustment required under
this Section 5(h), the aggregate consideration received by the Company for any issue or sale of
securities (the “Aggregate Consideration”) shall be defined as: (A) to the extent it consists of
cash, be computed at the gross amount of cash received by the Company before deduction of any
underwriting or similar commissions, compensation or concessions paid or allowed by the
Company in connection with such issue or sale and before deduction of any expenses payable by
the Company, (B) to the extent it consists of property other than cash, be computed at the fair
value of that property as determined in good faith by the Board, and (C) if Additional Shares of
Common Stock, Convertible Securities (as defined below) or rights or options to purchase either
Additional Shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities are issued or sold together with
other stock or securities or other assets of the Company for a consideration which covers both, be
computed as the portion of the consideration so received that may be reasonably determined in
good faith by the Board to be allocable to such Additional Shares of Common Stock, Convertible
Securities or rights or options.

(v) For the purpose of the adjustment required under this
Section 5(h), if the Company issues or sells (x) Preferred Stock or other stock, options, warrants,
purchase rights or other securities convertible into Additional Shares of Common Stock (such
convertible stock or securities being herein referred to as “Convertible Securities’) or (y) rights
or options for the purchase of Additional Shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities and
if the Effective Price of such Additional Shares of Common Stock is less than the Series
Preferred Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock, in each case the Company shall be
deemed to have issued at the time of the issuance of such rights or options or Convertible
Securities the maximum number of Additional Shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise
or conversion thereof and to have received as consideration for the issuance of such shares an
amount equal to the total amount of the consideration, if any, received by the Company for the
issuance of such rights or options or Convertible Securities plus:
(A) _ in the case of such nights or options, the minimum
amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon the exercise of such rights or
options; and

(B) in the case of Convertible Securities, the minimum
amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon the conversion thereof (other
than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities);
provided that if the minimum amounts of such consideration cannot be ascertained, but are a
function of antidilution or similar protective clauses, the Company shall be deemed to have
received the minimum amounts of consideration without reference to such clauses.

(C) — If the minimum amount of consideration payable to
the Company upon the exercise or conversion of rights, options or Convertible Securities is
reduced over time, from time to time or on the occurrence or non-occurrence of specified events
other than by reason of antidilution adjustments, the Effective Price shall be recalculated at each
such time or upon such event using the figure to which such minimum amount of consideration
is reduced; provided further, that if the minimum amount of consideration payable to the
Company upon the exercise or conversion of such rights, options or Convertible Securities is
subsequently increased over time, from time to time or on the occurrence or non-occurrence of
specified events other than by reason of antidilution adjustments, the Effective Price shall be
again recalculated using the increased minimum amount of consideration payable to the
Company upon the exercise or conversion of such rights, options or Convertible Securities.

(D) No further adjustment of the Series Preferred
Conversion Price, as adjusted, upon the issuance of such rights, options or Convertible
Securities, shall be made as a result of the actual issuance of Additional Shares of Common
Stock or the exercise of any such rights or options or the conversion of any such Convertible
Securities. If any such rights or options or the conversion privilege represented by any such
Convertible Securities shall expire without having been exercised, the Series Preferred
Conversion Price as adjusted upon the issuance of such rights, options or Convertible Securities
shall be readjusted to the Series Preferred Conversion Price which would have been in effect had
an adjustment been made on the basis that the only Additional Shares of Common Stock so
issued were the Additional Shares of Common Stock, if any, actually issued or sold on the
exercise of such rights or options or rights of conversion of such Convertible Securities, and such
Additional Shares of Common Stock, if any, were issued or sold for the consideration actually
received by the Company upon such exercise, plus the consideration, if any, actually received by
the Company for the granting of all such rights or options, whether or not exercised, plus the
consideration received for issuing or selling the Convertible Securities actually converted, plus
the consideration, if any, actually received by the Company (other than by cancellation of
liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities) on the conversion of such
Convertible Securities, provided that such readjustment shall not apply to prior conversions of
Series Preferred.

(vi) For the purpose of making any adjustment to the Series
Preferred Conversion Price required under this Section 5(h), “Additional Shares of Common
Stock” shall mean all shares of Common Stock issued by the Company or deemed to be issued
pursuant to this Section 5(h) (including shares of Common Stock subsequently reacquired or
retired by the Company), other than:

(A) _ shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of
Preferred Stock or as a dividend or distribution on the Preferred Stock;

(B) shares of Series A-1 Preferred and Series A-2
Preferred issued pursuant to that certain Series A-1] Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement dated
on or about the date hereof;

(C) — warrants issued in connection with and concurrently
with the sale of Series A-1 Preferred, any Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of such
warrants and any Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such Convertible Securities;

(D) — shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to the
exercise or conversion of Convertible Securities; provided that the antidilution adjustments set
forth in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation were complied with, waived, or
were inapplicable pursuant to any provision of this Section 5(h)(vi) with respect to the initial sale
or grant by the Company of such Convertible Securities;

(E) — shares of Common Stock issued by the Company
upon a stock split, stock dividend, or any subdivision of shares of Common Stock; or

(F) — shares of Common Stock or options exercisable for
Common Stock issued after the Original Issue Date of the Series A-1 Preferred (the “Series A-1
Original Issue Date”) to employees, officers or directors of, or consultants or advisors to the
Company or any subsidiary pursuant to stock purchase or stock option plans or other
arrangements that are approved by the Board; provided however, that such shares shall not
exceed 28,427,850 shares (as adjusted for stock dividends, combinations, splits recapitalizations
and the like and for the repurchase of unvested shares or the cancellation of options) unless a
greater amount of securities is approved by the Board, including two of the three representatives
of the Series Preferred.

References to Common Stock in the subsections of this clause (v) above shall
mean all shares of Common Stock issued by the Company or deemed to be issued pursuant to
this Section 5(h). The “Effective Price” of Additional Shares of Common Stock shall mean the
quotient determined by dividing the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock issued
or sold, or deemed to have been issued or sold by the Company under this Section 5(h), into the
Aggregate Consideration received, or deemed to have been received by the Company for such
issue under this Section 5(h), for such Additional Shares of Common Stock. In the event that the
number of shares of Additional Shares of Common Stock or the Effective Price cannot be
ascertained at the time of issuance, such Additional Shares of Common Stock shall be deemed
issued immediately upon the occurrence of the first event that makes such number of shares or
the Effective Price, as applicable, determinable.
(vii) In the event that the Company issues or sells, or is deemed
to have issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock in a Qualifying Dilutive Issuance
(the “First Dilutive Issuance’’), then in the event that the Company issues or sells, or is deemed to
have issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock in a Qualifying Dilutive Issuance other
than the First Dilutive Issuance as a part of the same transaction or series of related transactions
as the First Dilutive Issuance (a “Subsequent Dilutive Issuance”), then and in each such case
upon a Subsequent Dilutive Issuance the Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be reduced to
the Series Preferred Conversion Price that would have been in effect had the First Dilutive
Issuance and each Subsequent Dilutive Issuance all occurred on the closing date of the First
Dilutive Issuance.

(i) Certificate of Adjustment. In each case of an adjustment or
readjustment of the Series Preferred Conversion Price for the number of shares of Common
Stock or other securities issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock, if the Preferred Stock
is then convertible pursuant to this Section 5, the Company, at its expense, shall compute such
adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the provisions hereof and shall, promptly
following each adjustment or readjustment, prepare a certificate showing such adjustment or
readjustment, and shall mail such certificate, by first class mail, postage prepaid, to each
registered holder of Preferred Stock at the holder’s address as shown in the Company’s books.
The certificate shall set forth such adjustment or readjustment, showing in detail the facts upon
which such adjustment or readjustment is based, including a statement of (i) the consideration
received or deemed to be received by the Company for any Additional Shares of Common Stock
issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold, (ii) the Series Preferred Conversion Price in
effect prior to and after such adjustment or readjustment, (iii) the number of Additional Shares of
Common Stock issued or sold, or deemed to have been issued or sold and (iv) the number of
shares of Common Stock and the type and amount, if any, of other property which at the time
would be received upon conversion of the Preferred Stock. Failure to provide such notice shall
have no effect on any such adjustment.

(j) Notices of Record Date. Upon (i) any taking by the Company of a
record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof
who are entitled to receive any dividend or other distribution, or (ii) any Acquisition (as defined
in Section 4) or other capital reorganization of the Company or recapitalization of the capital
stock of the Company, any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into any other
corporation, or any Asset Transfer (as defined in Section 4), or any voluntary or involuntary
dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company, the Company shall mail to each holder of
Preferred Stock at least fifteen (15) days prior to the record date specified therein or the date
when such event shall take place (or such shorter period approved by the holders of a majority of
the voting power of the then outstanding Preferred Stock) a notice specifying (A) the date on
which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend or distribution and a
description of such dividend or distribution, (B) the date on which any such Acquisition,
reorganization, transfer, consolidation, merger, Asset Transfer, dissolution, liquidation or
winding up is expected to become effective, and (C) the date, if any, that is to be fixed as to when
the holders of record of Common Stock (or other securities) shall be entitled to exchange their
shares of Common Stock (or other securities) for securities or other property deliverable upon
such Acquisition, reorganization, transfer, consolidation, merger, Asset Transfer, dissolution,
liquidation or winding up.

(k) Automatic Conversion.

(i) Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be
converted into shares of Common Stock, based on the then-effective Series Preferred Conversion
Rate, (A) at any time upon the affirmative election of (1) the holders of at least a majority of the
voting power of the then outstanding shares of the Series Preferred, voting together as one class,
and (2) the holders of at least sixty-seven percent (67%) of the voting power of the then
outstanding shares of Series A-1 Preferred, or (B) immediately upon the closing of a firm
commitment, underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, lead-managed by an underwriter of national standing on
a nationally recognized securities exchange and covering the offer and sale of Common Stock for
the account of the Company in which (i) the price per share of Common Stock is at least equal to
four (4) times the Series A-1] Original Issue Price, and (ii) the gross cash proceeds to the
Company (before underwriting discounts, commissions and fees) are at least $50,000,000.

(ii) | Upon the occurrence of either of the events specified in
Section 5(k)(1) above, the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically
without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates
representing such shares are surrendered to the Company or its transfer agent; provided, however,
that the Company shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common
Stock issuable upon such conversion unless the certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred
Stock are either delivered to the Company or its transfer agent as provided below, or the holder
notifies the Company or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or
destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Company to indemnify the Company
from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates. Upon the occurrence of such
automatic conversion of the Preferred Stock, the holders of Preferred Stock shall surrender the
certificates representing such shares at the office of the Company or any transfer agent for the
Preferred Stock. Thereupon, there shall be issued and delivered to such holder promptly at such
office and in its name as shown on such surrendered certificate or certificates, a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Preferred Stock
surrendered were convertible on the date on which such automatic conversion occurred, and any
declared and unpaid dividends shal] be paid in accordance with the provisions of Section 5(d).

(I) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall
be issued upon conversion of Preferred Stock. All shares of Common Stock (including fractions
thereof) issuable upon conversion of more than one share of Preferred Stock by a holder thereof
shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the conversion would result in the
issuance of any fractional share. If, after the aforementioned aggregation, the conversion would
result in the issuance of any fractional share, the Company shall, in lieu of issuing any fractional
share, pay cash equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by the fair market value of one
share of Common Stock (as determined by the Board) on the date of conversion.
(m) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Company
shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common
Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock,
such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock. If at any time the number of authorized
but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, the Company will take such corporate action as may be
necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of
shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.

(n) = Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Section 5
shall be in writing and shall be deemed effectively given: (i) upon personal delivery to the party
to be notified, (11) when sent by confirmed electronic mail or facsimile if sent during normal
business hours of the party to be notified; if not, then on the next business day, (iii) five (5) days
after having been sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or
(iv) one (1) day after deposit with a nationally recognized overnight courier, specifying next day
delivery, with written verification of receipt. All notices shall be addressed to each holder of
record at the address of such holder appearing on the books of the Company.

(0) Payment of Taxes. The Company will pay all taxes (other than
taxes based upon income) and other governmental charges that may be imposed with respect to
the issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of shares of Preferred Stock,
excluding any tax or other charge imposed in connection with any transfer involved in the issue
and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in which the shares of
Preferred Stock so converted were registered.

(p) Mandatory Reclassification. Immediately following the
consummation of the closing of the Company’s initial sale of Series A-1 Preferred, each share of
outstanding or authorized Prior Series Preferred shall be reclassified into one share of Common
Stock (the “Reclassification”). The Reclassification shall occur without any further action on the
part of the Company or the holders of the Common Stock or Prior Series Preferred and whether
or not certificates representing the holders’ shares prior to the Reclassification are surrendered
for cancellation. Following the Reclassification, no shares of Prior Series Preferred shal] be
issued or authorized. The Company shall not be obliged to issue certificates evidencing the
shares of Common Stock outstanding as a result of the Reclassification unless and until the
certificates evidencing the shares of Prior Series Preferred held by a holder prior to the
Reclassification are delivered to the Company or its transfer agent (or, if such registered holder
alleges that such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and
agreement reasonably acceptable to the Company to indemnify the Company against any claim
that may be made against the Company on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of
such certificate).

6. REDEMPTION MECHANICS.

The Preferred Stock shall be redeemed only pursuant to Section 4(d).
(a) Redemption Notice. Promptly following receipt of a written
request of the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series Preferred
pursuant to Section 4(d), the Company shall deliver written notice of the redemption (the
“Redemption Notice”) to each holder of record of Series Preferred. The Redemption Notice shall
state:

(i) the number of shares of Series Preferred held by the holder
that the Company shal! redeem on the Redemption Date specified in the Redemption Notice;

(ii) the Redemption Date; and

(iii) | that the holder is to surrender to the Company, in the
manner and at the place designated, his, her or its certificate or certificates representing the
shares of Series Preferred to be redeemed.

(b) Surrender of Certificates; Payment. On or before the
Redemption Date, each holder of shares of Series Preferred to be redeemed on such Redemption
Date, unless such holder has exercised his, her or its right to convert such shares as provided in
Section 5, shall surrender the certificate or certificates representing such shares (or, if such
registered holder alleges that such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate
affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to the Company to indemnify the Company
against any claim that may be made against the Company on account of the alleged loss, theft or
destruction of such certificate) to the Company, in the manner and at the place designated in the
Redemption Notice, and thereupon the applicable Liquidation Amount for such shares shall be
payable to the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the
owner thereof. In the event that less than all of the shares of Series Preferred represented by a
certificate are redeemed, a new certificate representing the unredeemed shares of Series Preferred
shall promptly be issued to such holder.

(c) Rights Subsequent to Redemption. If the Redemption Notice
shall have been duly given, and if on the Redemption Date the full amount of the applicable
Liquidation Amount as provided in Section 3, above, payable upon redemption of the shares of
Series Preferred to be redeemed on such Redemption Date is paid or tendered for payment or
deposited with an independent payment agent so as to be available therefor, then notwithstanding
that the certificates evidencing any of the shares of Series Preferred so called for redemption shall
not have been surrendered, dividends with respect to such shares of Preferred Stock shall cease to
accrue after such Redemption Date and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith after
the Redemption Date terminate, except only the right of the holders to receive the applicable
Liquidation Amount without interest upon surrender of their certificate or certificates therefor.

Vv

A. The liability of the directors of the Company for monetary damages shall be
eliminated to the fullest extent under applicable law.

Company (and any other persons to which the Delaware General Corporation Law permits the
Company to provide indemnification) through bylaw provisions or through agreements with such
persons, or through stockholder resolutions, vote of disinterested directors, or otherwise, in
excess of the indemnification and advancement of expenses otherwise permitted by Section 145
of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority
of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Company
entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be
required for the stockholders to adopt, amend or repeal any provision of the Bylaws of the
