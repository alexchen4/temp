ANNEX A

Standard Provisions of the
Series A Convertible Participating Preferred Stock

1. Dividend Provisions

(a) Subject only to the priority of the dividends payable on the Class C
Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 1(a) of Annex C (the “Series C Dividend Preference”), the
holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive cash dividends, out of any
assets legally available therefor, prior and in preference to any declaration or payment of any
dividend (payable other than in Common Stock or other securities and rights convertible into or
entitling the holder thereof to receive, directly or indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock
of this Corporation) on the Common Stock of this Corporation, at the rate of 8% of the Original
Issue Price (as defined below), per share per annum (as adjusted for any stock splits,
subdivisions, stock dividends, combinations, recapitalizations and the like (collectively,
“Recapitalizations”)), payable quarterly on the first day of January, April, July and October of
each year. Notwithstanding the above, in lieu of cash payments and at the discretion of this
Corporation, the dividends owed hereunder or any portion thereof may accrue and cumulate to
the benefit of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock until (i) the payment of dividends on
Common Stock or other Preferred Stock (if any), or (ii) the occurrence of a Liquidation Event (as
defined below), conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, or a redemption thereof (all pursuant
to the provisions of this Certificate); in which event, the accrued and unpaid dividends shall be
paid to the holders of the Series A Preferred Shares in the manner provided for below with
respect to the relevant event. Until actually paid, the dividends owed hereunder will accrue on
each share of Series A Preferred Stock from the date of issuance, and will accrue from day to
day, whether or not earned or declared. Such dividends will be cumulative so that, if such
dividends in respect of any previous or current annual dividend period, at the annual rate
specified above, have not been paid the deficiency will first be fully paid before any dividend or
other distribution is paid on or declared and set apart for the Common Stock or other Preferred
Stock (if any), except for the Series C Dividend Preference. Any accumulation of dividends on
the Series A Preferred Stock will not bear interest.

(b) After the Series C Dividend Preference and after payment of any
dividends pursuant to Sections 1(a) above, any additional dividends, if so declared at the
discretion of this Corporation, will be distributed among all holders of Common Stock and all
holders of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock in
proportion to the number of shares of Common Stock which would be held by each such holder
if all shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock
were converted to Common Stock at the respective conversion price for such Preferred Stock as
then in effect.

(c) Each dividend owed under Section 1(a) above and each dividend
declared by the Board of Directors pursuant to Section 1(b) above, will be paid to holders of
record of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock as they appear on the stock register of the
Corporation on the record date, which will be 15 days before the dividend payment date.
Dividends in arrears for any past dividend period may be declared and paid at any time fixed by
the Board of Directors, whether or not a regular dividend payment date, to holders of record of
shares of Series A Preferred Stock as they appear on the stock register on the record date (which
will be 15 days before the anticipated payment date) and all such dividend payments will be
applied in the order in which such accumulated and unpaid dividends were originally due.

2. Liquidation Preference

(a) In the event of a Liquidation Event following the distribution of
assets in respect of the Series C Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 2(a) of Annex C (the “Series
C Liquidation Preference”), the holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive on a
pari passu basis with the holders of Series B Preferred Stock and prior and in preference to any
distribution of any of the assets of this Corporation to the holders of Common Stock and holders
of any other stock ranking junior on liquidation to the Series A Preferred Stock by reason of their
ownership thereof (but excluding the Series C Liquidation Preference), out of the assets of the
Corporation available for distribution to its shareholders, an amount per share equal to the sum of
(A) the Original Issue Price for each outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock (i.c.,
excluding shares of Series A Preferred Stock already converted) and (B) the amount of
accumulated and unpaid dividends (whether or not declared) on such share (subject to
adjustment for Recapitalizations). If upon the occurrence of such event, the assets and funds
thus distributed among the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred
Stock are insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full preferential amounts to
which they are entitled upon a Liquidation Event under this Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, then the entire assets and funds of this Corporation legally available for
distribution to stockholders will be distributed ratably among the holders of the Series A
Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock in proportion to the full preferential amount
each such holder is otherwise entitled: to receive.

(b) | Upon completion of the Series C Liquidation Preference and the
distribution required by Section 2(a), all of the remaining assets of this Corporation available for
distribution to stockholders will be distributed among the holders of Series A Preferred Stock,
the Series B Preferred Stock, the Series C Preferred Stock and Common Stock pro rata based on
the number of shares of Common Stock held or deemed held by each (assuming full conversion
into shares of Common Stock of all such outstanding Preferred Stock).

(c) (i) For purposes of this Section 2, a “Liquidation Event” will be
deemed to be occasioned by, or to include:

(A) the acquisition of this Corporation by another entity by means
of any one transaction or a series of related transactions (including,
without limitation, any merger, reorganization or consolidation, but
excluding any merger effected exclusively for the purpose of
changing the domicile of this Corporation) in which this
Corporation’s stockholders of record as constituted immediately
prior to such acquisition do not, immediately after such acquisition
(by virtue of securities issued as consideration for this

A-2
Corporation’s acquisition or otherwise), hold at least 50% of the
voting power of the resulting or surviving corporation following
such acquisition; (B) any transaction or a series of transactions in
which majority control of this Corporation is transferred to any one
or more persons or entities through a transfer to such persons or
entities of more than 50% of the Common Stock, on a fully diluted
basis; (C) the sale, lease, pledge or other disposition to any one or
more persons or entities of all or substantially all of the assets of
this Corporation in one transaction or a series of related
transactions; (D) the grant or pledge of an exclusive license to any
one or more persons or entities to all or a substantial part of this
Corporation’s intellectual property that is used to generate all or a
substantial part of the Corporation’s revenues; (E) the closing by
this Corporation of a firm commitment underwritten public
offering of the Common Stock pursuant to an effective registration
statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”)
(other than a registration statement relating either to the sale of
securities to employees of this Corporation pursuant to its stock
option, stock purchase or similar plan or a transaction pursuant to
Rule 145 promulgated under the Act), the public offering price of
which is not less than $5.00 per share (appropriately adjusted for
recapitalizations effected after the date hereof) and in which the
aggregate net proceeds (after, without limitation, deductions of
underwriters’ commissions and offering expenses) to this
Corporation exceed $27,000,000, which securities are deemed
“covered securities” as such term is defined in Section 18 of the
Act (a “Qualified Public Offering”); or (F) a Triggering Event (as
defined below). The term “Triggering Event” means any of the
following events:

(1) _ the signing by an authorized officer of this
Corporation of a petition for relief under Title 11, United States Code, as currently in effect or as
amended;

(2) the commencement of any involuntary
bankruptcy case or other proceeding against this Corporation under Title 11, United States Code,
as currently in effect or as amended (provided that if such case or proceeding is dismissed within
60 days after the date of such commencement, then a Triggering Event arising solely pursuant to
this clause as a result of such case or proceeding will be dismissed) or the appointment of a
trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or sequestrator (or other similar official) for this
Corporation or any substantial part of its property;

(3) the making by this Corporation of an
assignment for the benefit of creditors generally; or

(4) the failure or inability of this Corporation to
pay its debts generally as they become due.

A-3
(ii) If this Corporation receives consideration in a Liquidation
Event and such consideration is other than cash, its value will be deemed its fair market value as
determined below:

(A) Securities not subject to an investment letter or
other similar restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of a
stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate):

(1) if traded on a national securities exchange,
the value will be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such market
over the 30-day period ending five days prior to the closing of the Liquidation Event;

(2) if actively traded over-the-counter other than
through the Nasdaq National Market, the value will be deemed to be the average of the closing
bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the 30-day period ending five days prior to the
closing of the Liquidation Event; and

(3) if there is no active public market, the value
will be the fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by a majority of the Board of
Directors.

(B) The method of valuation of securities subject to an
investment letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely
by virtue of a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) will be to make an
appropriate discount from the value determined as above in Section 2(c)(ii)(A) to reflect the
approximate fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by a majority of the Board of
Directors.

(C) The value of assets other than securities will be
their fair market value as determined in good faith by the majority of the Board of Directors.

(iii) In the event that the requirements of this Section 2(c) are
not complied with (except with respect to a Triggering Event), this Corporation will forthwith
either:

(A) _ cause the closing of the Liquidation Event to be
postponed until such time as the requirements of this Section 2(c) have been complied with; or

(B) — cancel such transaction, in which event the powers,
preferences, privileges and other rights and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions of the
Series A Preferred Stock will revert to and be the same as such powers, preferences, privileges
and other rights and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions existing immediately prior to
the date of the first notice referred to in Section 2(c)(iv) hereof.

(iv) This Corporation shall give each holder of record of
Series A Preferred Stock written notice of an impending Liquidation Event (except for a
Triggering Event) not later than 30 days prior to the stockholders’ meeting called to approve
such transaction, or 30 days prior to the closing of such transaction, whichever is earlier, and

A-4
shall also notify such holders in writing of the final approval of such transaction. The first of
such notices shall describe the material terms and conditions of the impending transaction and
this Corporation will thereafter give such holders prompt notice of any material changes. The
transaction will in no event take place sooner than 20 days after this Corporation has given the
first notice provided for herein or sooner than 10 days after this Corporation has given notice of
any material changes provided for herein provided, however, that such periods may be shortened
upon the written consent of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock that are entitled to such
notice rights or similar notice rights and that represent at least a majority of the voting power of
all then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock voting as a separate class.

3. Conversion

The holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock will have conversion rights as follows
(the “Conversion Rights’):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock is
convertible, at the option of the holder thereof and without payment of any additional
consideration, at any time after the date of issuance of such share at the office of this Corporation
or any transfer agent for such stock, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Common Stock as is determined by dividing the applicable Original Issue Price per share (as
defined below) by the Conversion Price (determined as hereafter provided) in effect on the date
the certificate is surrendered for conversion, The initial Conversion Price per share is $1.00 (the
“Original Issue Price”), The initial Conversion Price will be subject to adjustment as set forth in
Section 3(e).

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock
will automatically and without further action on the part of this Corporation or any holder of
Series A Preferred Stock be converted into shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Price at
the time in effect for the Series A Preferred Stock immediately upon the earlier of (i) the closing
of a Qualified Public Offering or (ii) the date specified by written consent or agreement of the
holders of at least sixty percent (60%) of the then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock.

(c) Accumulated Dividends. Accumulated dividends with respect to a
share of Series A Preferred Stock which are accrued and unpaid will, upon conversion of such
share to Common Stock, be paid to the extent assets are legally available therefor and any
amounts for which assets are not legally available will be paid promptly as assets become legally
available therefor; any partial payment will be made pro rata among the holders of Series A
Preferred and Series B Preferred Stock, as the case may be, then entitled thereto. Such payment
of accrued dividends upon conversion shall be made in cash, or, at the individual option of each
converting stockholder, in Common Stock based on a price per share of Common Stock
equivalent to its then fair market value as determined in good faith by the majority of the Board
of Directors. Notwithstanding the above if, in connection with an automatic conversion as
provided in Section 3(b)(i) above, the lead underwriter of the Qualified Public Offering
determines that payment of such dividends in cash would be materially detrimental to the success
of such Qualified Public Offering, then regardless of the choice of the individual stockholder,
accrued and unpaid dividends shall be paid in cash only to the extent deemed necessary or
desirable by the lead underwriter.

A-5
(d) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Series A Preferred
Stock will be entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 4(a)
hereof, he, she or it must surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the
office of this Corporation or of any transfer agent for the Series A Preferred Stock, give written
notice to this Corporation at its principal corporate office, of the election to convert the same and
state therein the name or names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common
Stock are to be issued; provided, however, that in the event that the holder of Series A Preferred
Stock notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Corporation shall convert such holder’s Series A Preferred Stock into shares of
Common Stock provided that, such holder executes an agreement reasonably satisfactory to the
Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred in connection with such
certificates. This Corporation will, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such
office to such holder of Series A Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder,
a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled as aforesaid. With respect to conversion pursuant to Section 3(a) hereof, such
conversion will be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the
date of such surrender of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person
or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion will be
treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock as of
such date; and with respect to conversion pursuant to Section 3(b) hereof, such conversion will
be deemed to have been made upon the closing of a Qualified Public Offering or immediately
prior to the close of business on the date specified by the holders of at least two-thirds of the then
outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, as the case may be, and the person or persons
entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion will be treated for
all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock as of such date.

(e) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock. The Conversion
Prices of the Series A Preferred Stock will be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

(i) (A) If this Corporation issues, after the date upon which
the shares of Series A Preferred Stock were first issued (the “Purchase Date”), any Additional
Stock (as defined below) without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the
Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock, then the
Conversion Price for Series A Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to each such issuance
shall forthwith (except as otherwise provided in this Section 3(e)(i)) be adjusted to a price equal
to the quotient obtained by dividing the total computed under clause (x) below by the total
computed under clause (y) below:

(x) | an amount equal to the sum of:

(1) the aggregate purchase price of the shares of
Series A Preferred Stock sold pursuant to the agreement(s) under which such Series A Preferred

Stock were first issued (the “Stock Purchase Agreement(s)’”), plus

(2) the aggregate consideration, if any, received
by this Corporation for all Additional Stock for which this adjustment is made;

A-6
{y) | an amount equal to the sum of:

(1) the aggregate purchase price of the shares of
Series A Preferred Stock sold pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement(s) divided by the initial
Conversion Price in effect at the Purchase Date, plus

(2) the number of shares of Additional Stock
issued for which this adjustment is made.

(B) No adjustment of the Conversion Price will be made
in an amount less than one cent per share, provided that any adjustments that are not required to
be made by reason of this sentence will be carried forward and shall be either taken into account
in any subsequent adjustment made prior to three years from the date of the event giving rise to
the adjustment being carried forward, or will be made at the end of three years from the date of
the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward. Except to the limited extent
provided for in Sections 3(e)(i)(E)(3) and 3(e)(i)(E)(4), no adjustment of such Conversion Price
pursuant to this Section 3(e)(i) shall have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price above the
Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment.

(C) Inthe case of the issuance of Common Stock for
cash, the consideration will be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting
any reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by this
Corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

(D) In the case of the issuance of the Common Stock for
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash will be
deemed to be the fair value thereof as determined in good faith by a majority of the Board of
Directors irrespective of any accounting treatment.

(E) In the case of the issuance (whether on or after the
Purchase Date) of warrants, options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common Stock,
securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock or warrants,
options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or exchangeable securities, the
following provisions will apply for all purposes of this Section 3(e)(i) and Section 3(e)(ii):

(1) The aggregate maximum number of shares
of Common Stock deliverable upon exercise (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to
exercisability, including, without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account
potential antidilution adjustments) of such warrants, options to purchase or rights to subscribe for
Common Stock will be deemed to have been issued at the time such warrants, options or rights
were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the manner
provided in Sections 3(e)(i)(C) and 3(e)(i)(D)), if any, received by this Corporation upon the
issuance of such warrants, options or rights plus the minimum exercise price provided in such
warrants, options or rights (without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) for the
Common Stock covered thereby.

(2) The aggregate maximum number of shares
of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of, or in exchange (assuming the satisfaction of

A-7
any conditions to convertibility or exchangeability, including, without limitation, the passage of
time, but without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) for any such convertible
or exchangeable securities or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for
such convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof will
be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or such options or rights
were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration, if any, received by this
Corporation for any such securities and related options or rights (excluding any cash received on
account of accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the minimum additional consideration, if
any, to be received by this Corporation (without taking into account potential antidilution
adjustments) upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or the exercise of any related
options or rights (the consideration in each case to be determined in the manner provided in
Sections 3(e){i)(C) and 3(e)(i)(D)).

(3) Inthe event of any change in the number of

shares of Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to this Corporation upon
exercise of such options or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such convertible or
exchangeable securities, including, but not limited to, a change resulting from the antidilution
provisions thereof, the Conversion Price, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using
such options, rights or securities, will be recomputed to reflect such change, but no further
adjustment will be made for the actual issuance of Common Stock or any payment of such
consideration upon the exercise of any such options or rights or the conversion or exchange of
such securities.

(4) | Upon the expiration of any such options or
rights, the termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options
or rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Conversion Price, to the
extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, rights or securities or options or
rights related to such securities, will be recomputed to reflect the issuance of only the number of
shares of Common Stock (and convertible or exchangeable securities that remain in effect)
actually issued upon the exercise of such options or rights, upon the conversion or exchange of
such securities or upon the exercise of the options or rights related to such securities.

(5) The number of shares of Common Stock
deemed issued and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to Sections 3(e)(i)(E)(1) and
3(e)(i)(E)(2) will be appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or expiration of the
type described in either Section 3(e)(i)(E)(3) or 3(e)(G)(E)(4).

(ii) | “Additional Stock” means any shares of Common Stock
issued (or deemed to have been issued pursuant to Section 3(e)(i)(E)) by this Corporation after
the Purchase Date other than:

. (A) — shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to
a transaction described in Section 3(e)(iii) hereof;

(B) — shares of Common Stock issued or issuable
pursuant to a stock option plan, restricted stock plan, agreements or other incentive stock
arrangements approved by the stockholders and a majority of the Board of Directors of this
Corporation;

(C) — shares of Common Stock issued or issuable
to persons or entities with which the Company has strategic business relationships provided such
issuances are for other than primarily equity financing purposes and have been approved by the
majority of the Board of Directors of this Corporation;

(D) — shares of Common Stock issued at the
discretion of the majority of the Board of Directors, to vendors, service providers or suppliers to
this Corporation provided such issuances are for other than primarily equity financing purposes;

(E) — shares of Common Stock issued at the
discretion of the Board of Directors to financial institutions or lessors in connection with
commercial credit arrangements, equipment financings or similar transactions provided such
issuances are for other than primarily equity financing purposes;

(F) — shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to
the conversion, exchange or exercise of convertible or exercisable securities outstanding as of the
date hereof (including shares issued or to be issued to Life Sciences Greenhouse of Central PA or
LSGH, LLC (“LSGC”) and/or to Ben Franklin Technology Partners (“Ben Franklin”) pursuant
to agreements entered into, or warrants issued, prior to the Purchase Date) or subsequently issued
pursuant to this Section 3(e)(ii); or

(G) — shares of Common Stock the issuance of
which was approved by a majority of the Board of Directors; provided, that the holders of 60%
of the then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock consent to the exclusion of such shares
from the definition of Additional Stock.

Shares described under Section 3(e)(ii)(A) through 3(e)(ii)(G) above shall be referred to
herein as “Excluded Shares.”

(iii) In the event this Corporation should at any time or from
time to time after the Purchase Date fix a record date for the effectuation of a split or subdivision
of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or the determination of holders of Common Stock
entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock
or other securities or rights convertible into, exchangeable for, or entitling the holder thereof to
receive directly or indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock (the “Common Stock
Equivalents”) without payment of any consideration by such holder for the additional shares of
Common Stock or the Common Stock Equivalents (including the additional shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof), then, as of such record date (or the date of
such dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no record date is fixed), the Conversion Price
will be appropriately decreased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on
conversion of each share of Series A Preferred Stock will be increased in proportion to such
increase in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding and those issuable
with respect to such Common Stock Equivalents; provided, however, that if such record date is
fixed and such dividend is not paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed

A-9
therefor, the Conversion Price will be re-computed accordingly as of the close of business on
such record date and thereafter the Conversion Price will be adjusted pursuant to this Section 4 to
reflect the actual payment of such dividend or distribution.

(iv) Ifthe number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at
any time after the Purchase Date is decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock, then, following the record date of such combination, the Conversion Price will
be appropriately increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion
of each share of such series will be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding
shares.

(f) Other Distributions. In the event this Corporation declares a
distribution payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by this
Corporation or other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred
to in Section 3(e)(ii), then, in each such case for the purpose of this Section 3(f), the holders of
Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to a proportionate share of any such distribution as
though they were the holders of the number of shares of Common Stock of this Corporation into
which their shares of such Series A Preferred Stock are convertible as of the record date fixed for
the determination of the holders of Common Stock of this Corporation entitled to receive such
distribution.

(g) Reclassifications. If at any time or from time to time the Common
Stock of this Corporation is changed into the same or a different number of shares of any class or
classes of stock whether by Recapitalization or otherwise (other than a Recapitalization,
reclassification, exchange, reorganization, substitution or merger or sale of assets provided for
elsewhere in Section 2 hereof or this Section 3), provision will be made so that the holders of
Series A Preferred Stock be entitled to receive upon conversion of such shares the kind and
number of shares of stock or other securities or property of this Corporation or otherwise, to
which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of the
Series A Preferred Stock held by such holder would have been entitled on such Reclassification.
In any such case, appropriate adjustment will be made in the application of the provisions of this
Section 3 with respect to the rights of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock after the capital
reorganization such that the provisions of this Section 3 (including adjustment of the Conversion
Price then in effect and the number of shares purchasable upon conversion of the Series A
Preferred Stock) will be applicable after that event as nearly equivalent as may be practicable.

(h) No Impairment. This Corporation will not, by amendment of this
Certificate or through any reorganization, recapitalization, transfer of assets, consolidation,
merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to
avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder
by this Corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the
provisions of this Section 3 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or
appropriate in order to protect the Conversion Rights of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock
against impairment.

(i) No Fractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments.

A-10
(i) No fractional shares will be issued upon the conversion of
any share or shares of Series A Preferred Stock, and the number of shares of Common Stock to
be issued will be rounded to the nearest whole share. The number of shares of Common Stock to
be issued upon such conversion will be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of
Series A Preferred Stock the holder is at the time converting into Common Stock and the number
of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such aggregate conversion.

(ii) | Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of
the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 3, this Corporation, at its expense, will promptly
compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and prepare and
furnish to each holder of Series A Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or
readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is
based. This Corporation will, upon the written request at any time of any holder of Series A
Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (A)
such adjustment and readjustment, (B) the Conversion Price at the time in effect, and (C) the
number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property that at the time
would be received upon the conversion of a share of Series A Preferred Stock.

(j) Notices of Record Date. In the event of any taking by this
Corporation of a record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining
the holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend) or other
distribution, any right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of stock of any
class or any other securities or property, or to receive any other right, this Corporation will mail
to each holder of Series A Preferred Stock, at least 20 days prior to the date specified therein, a
notice specifying the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such
dividend, distribution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or

right.

(k) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion, Exercise or
Exchange. This Corporation will at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but

unissued shares of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the
shares of Series A Preferred Stock, such number of its shares of Common Stock as will from
time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred
Stock, and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock is not
sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, in
addition to such other remedies as are available to the holder of the Series A Preferred Stock, this
Corporation will take such corporate action as it deems necessary to increase its authorized but
unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as will be sufficient for such
purposes, including, without limitation, using its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to this Corporation’s Certificate of
Incorporation.

(1) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Section 4 to
be given to the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock will be deemed given if deposited in
the United States mail, postage prepaid, and (i) upon personal delivery to the party to be notified,
(ii) when sent by confirmed telex or facsimile if sent during normal business hours of the
recipient; if not, then on the next business day, (iii) five days after having been sent by registered

nationally recognized overnight courier, specifying next day delivery, with written verification of
receipt. All notices shall be addressed to each holder of record at his address appearing on the
books of this Corporation.

4, Voting Rights

The holder of each share of Series A Preferred Stock will have the right to one vote for
each share of Common Stock into which such share of Series A Preferred Stock could then be
converted, and with respect to such vote, such holder will have full voting rights and powers
equal to the voting rights and powers of the holders of Common Stock, and will be entitled,
notwithstanding any provision hereof, to notice of any stockholders’ meeting in accordance with
the Bylaws of this Corporation, and will be entitled to vote, together with holders of Common
Stock, with respect to any matter upon which holders of Common Stock have the right to vote.
Fractional votes will not, however, be permitted and any fractional voting rights available on an
as-converted basis (after aggregating all shares into which shares of Series A Preferred Stock
held by each holder could be converted) will be rounded to the nearest whole number (with one-
half being rounded upward).

5. Protective Provisions

A-12
(vi) effect any reclassification or recapitalization of another

shares of Series A Preferred Stock.

(b) So long as any shares of Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding,

from time to time.

6. Preemptive Rights

Subject to the terms and conditions specified in this Section, each holder of Series A
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and each of the Founders (as
defined below, and collectively for the purposes of this Section, a “Preferred Holder’) has a right
of first refusal with respect to future sales by this Corporation of any Shares (as hereinafter
defined). Each time this Corporation proposes to offer any shares of, or securities convertible
into or exchangeable or exercisable for any shares of, any class of its capital stock (the “Shares”),
this Corporation will first make an offering of such Shares to each Preferred Holder in
accordance with the following provisions:

(a) Not less than 30 days prior to such offering, this Corporation will
deliver a notice (the “Notice”) to each Preferred Holder of record stating (i) its bona fide
intention to offer such Shares, (11) the number of such Shares to be offered, (iit) the price (which
must be in cash) and terms upon which it proposes to offer such Shares and (iv) the manner of
sale.

(b) By written notification received by this Corporation, within 20
days after receipt of the Notice, the Preferred Holder may elect to purchase or obtain, at the price
and on the terms specified in the Notice, that portion of such Shares that equals the proportion
that the number of shares of Common Stock issued and held, or issuable upon conversion of the
Series A Preferred Stock then held, by such Preferred Holder bears to the total number of shares
of Common Stock of this Corporation then outstanding (assuming full conversion of the Series A
Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock). This Corporation shall promptly, in writing,
inform each Preferred Holder which purchases all the shares available to it (“Fully-Exercising
Holder”) of any other Shares available due to any Preferred Holder’s election not to purchase
any or all of the Shares available to such holder. During the 10-day period commencing after
receipt of such information, cach Fully-Exercising Holder will be entitled to obtain an amount of
Shares of the entire offering which were not subscribed for by other Preferred Holders which is
equal to the proportion that the number of shares of Common Stock issued and held, or issuable
upon conversion of the shares of Preferred Stock then held, by such Fully-Exercising Holder
bears to the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and held, or issuable upon

A-14
conversion of the shares of Preferred Stock then held, by all Fully-Exercising Holders who wish
to purchase some of the unsubscribed shares.

(c) If all Shares that Preferred Holders are entitled to obtain pursuant
to Section 6(b) above are not elected to be obtained as provided in such paragraph, this
Corporation may, during the 90-day period following the expiration of the period provided in
Section 6(b) hereof, offer the remaining unsubscribed portion of such Shares to any person or
persons at a price not less than, and upon terms no more favorable to the offeree than those
specified in the Notice. If this Corporation does not enter into an agreement for the sale of the
Shares within such period, or if such agreement is not consummated within 90 days of the
execution thereof, the right provided hereunder will be deemed to be revived and such Shares
will not be offered unless first reoffered to the Preferred Holders in accordance herewith.

(d) Notwithstanding the definition of the term “Shares” above, the
right of first refusal in this Section 6 shall not be applicable to: (i) the issuance of this
Corporations’ shares to the public pursuant to an effective underwritten registration statement
filed under the Act; (ii) the issuance of Excluded Shares; (iii) the issuance of securities in
connection with a bona fide business acquisition of or by this Corporation, whether by merger,
consolidation, sale of assets, sale or exchange of stock or otherwise; (iv) the exercise of any right
which was not itself a violation of this Section 6(d); or (v) issuances of securities in which a
majority-in-interest of the holders of Preferred Stock and a majority-in-interest of the Founders
agree in writing to waive the preemptive rights granted pursuant to Section 6.

(e) The preemptive rights set forth in this Section 6 may not be
assigned or transferred, except that (i) such rights are assignable by each Preferred Holder to any
wholly-owned subsidiary or parent of, or to any corporation or entity that is, within the meaning
of the Act, an affiliate of such Preferred Holder, and (ii) such right is assignable to a permitted
transferee or assignee of the Preferred Holders.

(f) The term “Founder” means each of Neal G. Simon, Gary Koppel,
Craig Ferris and Michael Brownstein.
ANNEX B

Standard Provisions of the
Series B Convertible Participating Preferred Stock

1. Dividend Provisions

(a) Subject only to the priority of the dividends payable on the Class C
Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 1{a) of Annex C (the “Series C Dividend Preference”), the
holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to receive cash dividends, out of any
assets legally available therefor, prior and in preference to any declaration or payment of any
dividend (payable other than in Common Stock or other securities and rights convertible into or
entitling the holder thereof to receive, directly or indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock
of this Corporation) on the Common Stock of this Corporation, at the rate of 8% of the Original
Issue Price (as defined below), per share per annum (as adjusted for any stock splits,
subdivisions, stock dividends, combinations, recapitalizations and the like (collectively,
“Recapitalizations”)), payable quarterly on the first day of January, April, July and October of
each year, with the first dividend payable on April 1, 2009. Notwithstanding the above, in lieu
of cash payments and at the discretion of this Corporation, the dividends owed hereunder or any
portion thereof may accrue and cumulate to the benefit of the holders of the Series B Preferred
Stock until (i) the payment of dividends on Common Stock or other Preferred Stock (if any), or
(ii) the occurrence of a Liquidation Event (as defined below), conversion of the Series B
Preferred Stock, or a redemption thereof (all pursuant to the provisions of this Certificate); in
which event, the accrued and unpaid dividends shall be paid to the holders of the Series B
Preferred Shares in the manner provided for below with respect to the relevant event. Until
actually paid, the dividends owed hereunder will accrue on each share of Series B Preferred
Stock from the date of issuance, and will accrue from day to day, whether or not earned or
declared. Such dividends will be cumulative so that, if such dividends in respect of any previous
or current annual dividend period, at the annual rate specified above, have not been paid the
deficiency will first be fully paid before any dividend or other distribution is paid on or declared
and set apart for the Common Stock or other Preferred Stock (if any), except for the Series C
Dividends Preference. Any accumulation of dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock will not
bear interest.

(b) After the Series C Dividend Preference and after payment of any
dividends pursuant to Sections 1(a) above, any additional dividends, if so declared at the
discretion of this Corporation, will be distributed among all holders of Common Stock and all
holders of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock in
proportion to the number of shares of Common Stock which would be held by each such holder
if all shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock
were converted to Common Stock at the respective conversion prices for such Preferred Stock as
then effective.

(c) Each dividend owed under Section 1(a) above and each dividend
declared by the Board of Directors pursuant to Section 1(b) above, will be paid to holders of
record of shares of the Series B Preferred Stock as they appear on the stock register of the
Corporation on the record date, which will be 15 days before the dividend payment date.
Dividends in arrears for any past dividend period may be declared and paid at any time fixed by
the Board of Directors, whether or not a regular dividend payment date, to holders of record of
shares of Series B Preferred Stock as they appear on the stock register on the record date (which
will be 15 days before the anticipated payment date) and all such dividend payments will be
applied in the order in which such accumulated and unpaid dividends were originally due.

2. Liquidation Preference

(a) In the event of a Liquidation Event following the distribution of
assets in respect of the Series C Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 2(a) of Annex C (the “Series
C Liquidation Preference”), the holders of Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to receive on a
pari passu basis with the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and prior and in preference to any
distribution of any of the assets of this Corporation to the holders of Common Stock and holders
of any other stock ranking junior on liquidation to the Series B Preferred Stock by reason of their
ownership thereof (but excluding the Series C Liquidation Preference), out of the assets of the
Corporation available for distribution to its shareholders an amount per share equal to the sum of
(A) the Original Issue Price for each outstanding share of Series B Preferred Stock (i.e.,
excluding shares of Series B Preferred Stock already converted) and (B) the amount of
accumulated and unpaid dividends (whether or not declared) on such share (subject to
adjustment for Recapitalizations). If upon the occurrence of such event, the assets and funds
thus distributed among the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred
Stock are insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full preferential amounts to
which they are entitled upon a Liquidation Event under this Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, then the entire assets and funds of this Corporation legally available for
distribution to stockholders will be distributed ratably among the holders of the Series A
Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock in proportion to the full preferential amount
each such holder is otherwise entitled to receive.

(b) | Upon completion of the Series C Liquidation Preference and the
distribution required by Section 2(a), all of the remaining assets of this Corporation available for
distribution to stockholders will be distributed among the holders of Series A Preferred Stock,
Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and Common Stock pro rata based on the
number of shares of Common Stock held or deemed held by each (assuming full conversion into
shares of Common Stock of all such outstanding Preferred Stock).

(c) i) For purposes of this Section 2, a “Liquidation Event” will
be deemed to be occasioned by, or to include:

(A) the acquisition of this Corporation by another entity by means
of any one transaction or a series of related transactions (including,
without limitation, any merger, reorganization or consolidation, but
excluding any merger effected exclusively for the purpose of
changing the domicile of this Corporation) in which this
Corporation’s stockholders of record as constituted immediately
prior to such acquisition do not, immediately after such acquisition

B-2
(by virtue of securities issued as consideration for this
Corporation’s acquisition or otherwise), hold at least 50% of the
voting power of the resulting or surviving corporation following
such acquisition; (B) any transaction or a series of transactions in
which majority control of this Corporation is transferred to any one
or more persons or entities through a transfer to such persons or
entities of more than 50% of the Common Stock, on a fully diluted
basis; (C) the sale, lease, pledge or other disposition to any one or
more persons or entities of all or substantially all of the assets of
this Corporation in one transaction or a series of related
transactions; (D) the grant or pledge of an exclusive license to any
one or more persons or entities to all or a substantial part of this
Corporation’s intellectual property that is used to generate all or a
substantial part of the Corporation’s revenues; (E) the closing by
this Corporation of a firm commitment underwritten public
offering of its common stock pursuant to an effective registration
statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”’)
(other than a registration statement relating either to the sale of
securities to employees of this Corporation pursuant to its stock
option, stock purchase or similar plan or a transaction pursuant to
Rule 145 promulgated under the Act), the public offering price of
which is not less than $5.00 per share (appropriately adjusted for
recapitalizations effected after the date hereof) and in which the
aggregate net proceeds (after, without limitation, deductions of
underwriters’ commissions and offering expenses) to this
Corporation exceed $27,000,000, which securities are deemed
“covered securities” as such term is defined in Section 18 of the
Act (a “Qualified Public Offering”); or (F) a Triggering Event (as
defined below). The term “Triggering Event” means any of the
following events:

(1) _ the signing by an authorized officer of this
Corporation of a petition for relief under Title 11, United States Code, as currently in effect or as
amended;

(2) the commencement of any involuntary
bankruptcy case or other proceeding against this Corporation under Title 11, United States Code,
as currently in effect or as amended (provided that if such case or proceeding is dismissed within
60 days after the date of such commencement, then a Triggering Event arising solely pursuant to
this clause as a result of such case or proceeding will be dismissed) or the appointment of a
trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or sequestrator (or other similar official) for this
Corporation or any substantial part of its property;

(3) the making by this Corporation of an
assignment for the benefit of creditors generally; or

B-3
(4) __ the failure or inability of this Corporation to
pay its debts generally as they become due.

(ii) If this Corporation receives consideration in a Liquidation
Event and such consideration is other than cash, its value will be deemed its fair market value as
determined below:

(A) Securities not subject to an investment letter or
other similar restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of a
stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate):

(1) if traded on a national securities exchange,
the value will be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such market
over the 30-day period ending five days prior to the closing of the Liquidation Event;

(2) if actively traded over-the-counter other than
through the Nasdaq National Market, the value will be deemed to be the average of the closing
bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the 30-day period ending five days prior to the
closing of the Liquidation Event; and

(3) if there is no active public market, the value
will be the fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by a majority of the Board of
Directors.

(B) The method of valuation of securities subject to an
investment letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely
by virtue of a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) will be to make an
appropriate discount from the value determined as above in Section 2(c)(ii)(A) to reflect the
approximate fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by a majority of the Board of
Directors.

(C) The value of assets other than securities will be
their fair market value as determined in good faith by the majority of the Board of Directors.

(iii) In the event that the requirements of this Section 2(c) are
not complied with (except with respect to a Triggering Event), this Corporation will forthwith
either:

(A) cause the closing of the Liquidation Event to be
postponed until such time as the requirements of this Section 2(c) have been complied with; or

(B) cancel such transaction, in which event the powers,
preferences, privileges and other rights and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions of the
Series B Preferred Stock will revert to and be the same as such powers, preferences, privileges
and other rights and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions existing immediately prior to
the date of the first notice referred to in Section 2(c)(iv) hereof.

B-4
(iv) | This Corporation shall give each holder of record of
Series B Preferred Stock written notice of an impending Liquidation Event (except for a
Triggering Event) not later than 30 days prior to the stockholders’ meeting called to approve
such transaction, or 30 days prior to the closing of such transaction, whichever is earlier, and
shall also notify such holders in writing of the final approval of such transaction. The first of
such notices shal! describe the material terms and conditions of the impending transaction and
this Corporation will thereafter give such holders prompt notice of any material changes. The
transaction will in no event take place sooner than 20 days after this Corporation has given the
first notice provided for herein or sooner than 10 days after this Corporation has given notice of
any material changes provided for herein; provided, however, that such periods may be
shortened upon the written consent of the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock that are entitled
to such notice rights or similar notice rights and that represent at least a majority of the voting
power of all then outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock voting as separate class.

3. Conversion

The holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock will have conversion rights as follows
(the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Series B Preferred Stock is
convertible, at the option of the holder thereof and without payment of any additional
consideration, at any time after the date of issuance of such share at the office of this Corporation
or any transfer agent for such stock, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Common Stock as is determined by dividing the applicable Original Issue Price per share (as
defined below) by the Conversion Price (determined as hereafter provided) in effect on the date
the certificate is surrendered for conversion. The initial Conversion Price per share is $1.323
(the “Original Issue Price”). The initial Conversion Price will be subject to adjustment as set
forth in Section 3(e).

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Series B Preferred Stock
will automatically and without further action on the part of this Corporation or any holder of
Series B Preferred Stock be converted into shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Price at
the time in effect for the Series B Preferred Stock immediately upon the earlier of (i) the closing
of a Qualified Public Offering or (ii) the date specified by written consent or agreement of the
holders of at least sixty percent (60%) of the then outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock.

(c) Accumulated Dividends. Accumulated dividends with respect to a
share of Series B Preferred Stock which are accrued and unpaid will, upon conversion of such
share to Common Stock, be paid to the extent assets are legally available therefor and any
amounts for which assets are not legally available will be paid promptly as assets become legally
available therefor; any partial payment will be made pro rata among the holders of Series A
Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, as the case may be, then entitled thereto. Such
payment of accrued dividends upon conversion shall be made in cash, or, at the individual option
of each converting stockholder, in Common Stock based on a price per share of Common Stock
equivalent to its then fair market value as determined in good faith by the majority of the Board
of Directors. Notwithstanding the above, if, in connection with an automatic conversion as
provided in Section 3(b)(i) above, the lead underwriter of the Qualified Public Offering

B-5
determines that payment of such dividends in cash would be materially detrimental to the success
of such Qualified Public Offering, then regardless of the choice of the individual stockholder,
accrued and unpaid dividends shall be paid in cash only to the extent deemed necessary or
desirable by the lead underwriter.

(d) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Series B Preferred
Stock will be entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 4(a)
hereof, he, she or it must surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the
office of this Corporation or of any transfer agent for the Series B Preferred Stock, give written
notice to this Corporation at its principal corporate office, of the election to convert the same and
state therein the name or names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common
Stock are to be issued; provided, however, that in the event that the holder of Series B Preferred
Stock notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Corporation shall convert such holder’s Series B Preferred Stock into shares of
Common Stock provided that such holder executes an agreement reasonably satisfactory to the
Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred in connection with such
certificates. This Corporation will, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such
office to such holder of Series B Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder,
a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled as aforesaid. With respect to conversion pursuant to Section 3(a) hereof, such
conversion will be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the
date of such surrender of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person
or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion will be
treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock as of
such date; and with respect to conversion pursuant to Section 3(b) hereof, such conversion will
be deemed to have been made upon the closing of a Qualified Public Offering or immediately
prior to the close of business on the date specified by the holders of at least 60% of the then
outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock, as the case may be, and the person or persons
entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion will be treated for
all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock as of such date.

(e) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock. The Conversion
Prices of the Series B Preferred Stock will be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

(i) (A) If this Corporation issues, after the date upon which
the shares of Series B Preferred Stock were first issued (the “Purchase Date”), any Additional
Stock (as defined below) without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the
Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock, then the
Conversion Price for Series B Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to each such issuance
shall forthwith (except as otherwise provided in this Section 4(e)(i)) be adjusted to a price equal
to the per share consideration, if any, received or deemed to be received by the Corporation in
connection with the issuance of the Additional Stock.

(B) No adjustment of the Conversion Price will be made
in an amount less than one cent per share, provided that any adjustments that are not required to
be made by reason of this sentence will be carried forward and shall be either taken into account
in any subsequent adjustment made prior to three years from the date of the event giving rise to

B-6
the adjustment being carried forward, or will be made at the end of three years from the date of
the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward. Except to the limited extent
provided for in Sections 3(e)(i)(E)(3) and 3(e)(i)(E)(4), no adjustment of such Conversion Price
pursuant to this Section 3(e)(i) shall have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price above the
Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment.

(C) In the case of the issuance of Common Stock for
cash, the consideration will be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting
any reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by this
Corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

(D) Inthe case of the issuance of the Common Stock for
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash will be
deemed to be the fair value thereof as determined in good faith by a majority of the Board of
Directors irrespective of any accounting treatment.

(E) In the case of the issuance (whether on or after the
Purchase Date) of warrants, options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common Stock,
securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock or warrants,
options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or exchangeable securities, the
following provisions will apply for all purposes of this Section 3(e)(i) and Section 3(e)(ii):

(1) The aggregate maximum number of shares
of Common Stock deliverable upon exercise (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to
exercisability, including, without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account
potential antidilution adjustments) of such warrants, options to purchase or rights to subscribe for
Common Stock will be deemed to have been issued at the time such warrants, options or rights
were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the manner
provided in Sections 3(e)(i)(C) and 3(e)G)(D)), if any, received by this Corporation upon the
issuance of such warrants, options or rights plus the minimum exercise price provided in such
warrants, options or rights (without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) for the
Common Stock covered thereby.

(2) The aggregate maximum number of shares
of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of, or in exchange (assuming the satisfaction of
any conditions to convertibility or exchangeability, including, without limitation, the passage of
time, but without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) for any such convertible
or exchangeable securities or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for
such convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof will
be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or such options or rights
were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration, if any, received by this
Corporation for any such securities and related options or rights (excluding any cash received on
account of accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the minimum additional consideration, if
any, to be received by this Corporation (without taking into account potential antidilution
adjustments) upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or the exercise of any related
options or rights (the consideration in each case to be determined in the manner provided in
Sections 3(e)(i)(C) and 3(e)(()(D)).

B-7
(3) In the event of any change in the number of
shares of Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to this Corporation upon
exercise of such options or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such convertible or
exchangeable securities, including, but not limited to, a change resulting from the antidilution
provisions thereof, the Conversion Price, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using
such options, rights or securities, will be recomputed to reflect such change, but no further
adjustment will be made for the actual issuance of Common Stock or any payment of such
consideration upon the exercise of any such options or rights or the conversion or exchange of
such securities.

(4) Upon the expiration of any such options or
rights, the termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options
or rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Conversion Price, to the
extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, rights or securities or options or
rights related to such securities, will be recomputed to reflect the issuance of only the number of
shares of Common Stock (and convertible or exchangeable securities that remain in effect)
actually issued upon the exercise of such options or rights, upon the conversion or exchange of
such securities or upon the exercise of the options or rights related to such securities.

(5) The number of shares of Common Stock
deemed issued and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to Sections 3(e)(i)(E)(1) and
3(e)(1)(E)(2) will be appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or expiration of the
type described in either Section 3(e)(i)(E)(3) or 3(e)(i)(E)(4).

(ii) “Additional Stock” means any shares of Common Stock
issued (or deemed to have been issued pursuant to Section 3(e)(i)(E)) by this Corporation after
the Purchase Date other than:

(A) shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to a
transaction described in Section 3(e){iii) hereof;

(B) — shares of Common Stock issued or issuable
pursuant to a stock option plan, restricted stock plan, agreements or other incentive stock
atrangements approved by the stockholders and a majority of the Board of Directors;

(C) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable to
persons or entities with which the Company has strategic business relationships provided such
issuances are for other than primarily equity financing purposes and have been approved by the
majority of the Board of Directors;

(D) _ shares of Common Stock issued at the discretion of
the majority of the Board of Directors, to vendors, service providers or suppliers to this
Corporation provided such issuances are for other than primarily equity financing purposes;

(E) shares of Common Stock issued at the discretion of
the Board of Directors to financial institutions or lessors in connection with commercial credit
arrangements, equipment financings or similar transactions provided such issuances are for other
than primarily equity financing purposes;

B-8
(F) shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to the
conversion, exchange or exercise of convertible or exercisable securities outstanding as of the
date hereof (including shares issued or to be issued to Life Sciences Greenhouse of Central PA or
LSGH, LLC (“LSGC”) and/or to Ben Franklin Technology Partners (“Ben Franklin”) pursuant
to agreements entered into, or warrants issued, prior to the Purchase Date) or subsequently issued
pursuant to this Section 3(e)(ii); or

(G) shares of Common Stock the issuance of which was
approved by a majority of the Board of Directors; provided, that the holders of 60% of the then
outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock consent to the exclusion of such shares from the
definition of Additional Stock.

Shares described under Section 3(e)(ii)(A) through 3(e)(ii)(G) above shall be referred to
herein as “Excluded Shares.”

(iii) In the event this Corporation should at any time or from
time to time after the Purchase Date fix a record date for the effectuation of a split or subdivision
of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or the determination of holders of Common Stock
entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock
or other securities or rights convertible into, exchangeable for, or entitling the holder thereof to
receive directly or indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock (the “Common Stock
Equivalents”) without payment of any consideration by such holder for the additional shares of
Common Stock or the Common Stock Equivalents (including the additional shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof), then, as of such record date (or the date of
such dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no record date is fixed), the Conversion Price
will be appropriately decreased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on
conversion of each share of Series B Preferred Stock will be increased in proportion to such
increase in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding and those issuable
with respect to such Common Stock Equivalents; provided, however, that if such record date is
fixed and such dividend is not paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed
therefor, the Conversion Price will be re-computed accordingly as of the close of business on
such record date and thereafter the Conversion Price will be adjusted pursuant to this Section 4 to
reflect the actual payment of such dividend or distribution.

(iv) If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at
any time after the Purchase Date is decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock, then, following the record date of such combination, the Conversion Price will
be appropriately increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion
of each share of such series will be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding
shares.

(f) Other Distributions. In the event this Corporation declares a
distribution payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by this
Corporation or other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred
to in Section 3(e)(ii), then, in each such case for the purpose of this Section 3(f), the holders of
Series B Preferred Stock will be entitled to a proportionate share of any such distribution as
though they were the holders of the number of shares of Common Stock of this Corporation into

B-9
which their shares of such Series B Preferred Stock are convertible as of the record date fixed for
the determination of the holders of Common Stock of this Corporation entitled to receive such
distribution.

(g) Reclassifications. If at any time or from time to time the Common
Stock of this Corporation is changed into the same or a different number of shares of any class or
classes of stock whether by Recapitalization or otherwise (other than a Recapitalization,
reclassification, exchange, reorganization, substitution or merger or sale of assets provided for
elsewhere in Section 2 hereof or this Section 3), provision will be made so that the holders of
Series B Preferred Stock be entitled to recetve upon conversion of such shares the kind and
number of shares of stock or other securities or property of this Corporation or otherwise, to
which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of the
Series B Preferred Stock held by such holder would have been entitled on such Reclassification.
In any such case, appropriate adjustment will be made in the application of the provisions of this
Section 3 with respect to the rights of the holders of Series B Preferred Stock after the capital
reorganization such that the provisions of this Section 3 (including adjustment of the Conversion
Price then in effect and the number of shares purchasable upon conversion of the Series B
Preferred Stock) will be applicable after that event as nearly equivalent as may be practicable.

(h) No Impairment. This Corporation will not, by amendment of this
Certificate or through any reorganization, recapitalization, transfer of assets, consolidation,
merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to
avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder
by this Corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the
provisions of this Section 3 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or
appropriate in order to protect the Conversion Rights of the holders of Series B Preferred Stock
against impairment.

(i) No Fractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments.

(i) No fractional shares will be issued upon the conversion of
any share or shares of Series B Preferred Stock, and the number of shares of Common Stock to
be issued will be rounded to the nearest whole share. The number of shares of Common Stock to
be issued upon such conversion will be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of
Series B Preferred Stock the holder is at the time converting into Common Stock and the number
of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such aggregate conversion.

(ii) | Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of
the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 3, this Corporation, at its expense, will promptly
compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and prepare and
furnish to each holder of Series B Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or
readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is
based. This Corporation will, upon the written request at any time of any holder of Series B
Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (A)
such adjustment and readjustment, (B) the Conversion Price at the time in effect, and (C) the
number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property that at the time
would be received upon the conversion of a share of Series B Preferred Stock.

B-10
(j) Notices of Record Date. In the event of any taking by this
Corporation of a record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining
the holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend) or other
distribution, any right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of stock of any
class or any other securities or property, or to receive any other right, this Corporation will mail
to each holder of Series B Preferred Stock, at least 20 days prior to the date specified therein, a
notice specifying the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such
dividend, distribution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or
right.

(k) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion, Exercise or
Exchange. This Corporation will at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but

unissued shares of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the
shares of Series B Preferred Stock, such number of its shares of Common Stock as will from
time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred
Stock, and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock is not
sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock, in
addition to such other remedies as are available to the holder of the Series B Preferred Stock, this
Corporation will take such corporate action as it deems necessary to increase its authorized but
unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as will be sufficient for such
purposes, including, without limitation, using its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to this Corporation’s Certificate of
Incorporation.

(1) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Section 4 to
be given to the holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock will be deemed given if deposited in
the United States mail, postage prepaid, and (i) upon personal delivery to the party to be notified,
(ii) when sent by confirmed telex or facsimile if sent during normal business hours of the
recipient; if not, then on the next business day, (iii) five days after having been sent by registered
or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or (iv) one (1) day after deposit with a
nationally recognized overnight courier, specifying next day delivery, with written verification of
receipt. All notices shall be addressed to each holder of record at its address appearing on the
books of this Corporation.

4. Voting Rights

The holder of each share of Series B Preferred Stock will have the right to one vote for
each share of Common Stock into which such share of Series B Preferred Stock could then be
converted, and with respect to such vote, such holder will have full voting rights and powers
equal to the voting rights and powers of the holders of Common Stock, and will be entitled,
notwithstanding any provision hereof, to notice of any stockholders’ meeting in accordance with
the Bylaws of this Corporation, and will be entitled to vote, together with holders of Common
Stock, with respect to any matter upon which holders of Common Stock have the right to vote.
Fractional votes will not, however, be permitted and any fractional voting rights available on an
as-converted basis (after aggregating all shares into which shares of Series B Preferred Stock
held by each holder could be converted) will be rounded to the nearest whole number (with one-
half being rounded upward).

B-11
5, Protective Provisions

shares of Series B Preferred Stock are outstanding, this Corporation will not without first

from time to time.

6. Preemptive Rights

Subject to the terms and conditions specified in this Section, each holder of Series A
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and each of the Founders (as

B-13
defined below, and collectively for the purposes of this Section, the “Preferred Holder”) has a
right of first refusal with respect to future sales by this Corporation of any Shares (as hereinafter
defined). Each time this Corporation proposes to offer any shares of, or securities convertible
into or exchangeable or exercisable for any shares of, any class of its capital stock (the “Shares”),
this Corporation will first make an offering of such Shares to each Preferred Holder in
accordance with the following provisions;

(a) Not less than 30 days prior to such offering, this Corporation will
deliver a notice (the “Notice”) to each Preferred Holder of record stating (i) its bona fide
intention to offer such Shares, (ii) the number of such Shares to be offered, (iii) the price (which
must be in cash) and terms upon which it proposes to offer such Shares; and (iv) the manner of
sale.

(b) By written notification received by this Corporation, within 20
days after receipt of the Notice, the Preferred Holder may elect to purchase or obtain, at the price
and on the terms specified in the Notice, that portion of such Shares that equals the proportion
that the number of shares of Common Stock issued and held, or issuable upon conversion of the
Preferred Stock then held, by such Preferred Holder bears to the total number of shares of
Common Stock of this Corporation then outstanding (assuming full conversion of the Series A
Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock). This Corporation shall promptly, in writing,
inform each Preferred Holder which purchases all the shares available to it (“Fully-Exercising
Holder”) of any other Shares available due to any Preferred Holder’s election not to purchase
any or all of the Shares available to such holder likewise. During the 10-day period commencing
after receipt of such information, each Fully-Exercising Holder will be entitled to obtain an
amount of Shares of the entire offering which were not subscribed for by other Preferred Holders
which is equal to the proportion that the number of shares of Common Stock issued and held, or
issuable upon conversion of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock then held, by such Fully-
Exercising Holder bears to the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and held, or
issuable upon conversion of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock then held, by all Fully-
Exercising Holders who wish to purchase some of the unsubscribed shares.

(c) — Tfall Shares that Preferred Holders are entitled to obtain pursuant
to Section 6(b) above are not elected to be obtained as provided in such paragraph, this
Corporation may, during the 90-day period following the expiration of the period provided in
Section 6(b) hereof, offer the remaining unsubscribed portion of such Shares to any person or
persons at a price not less than, and upon terms no more favorable to the offeree than those
specified in the Notice. If this Corporation does not enter into an agreement for the sale of the
Shares within such period, or if such agreement is not consummated within 90 days of the
execution thereof, the right provided hereunder will be deemed to be revived and such Shares
will not be offered unless first reoffered to the Preferred Holders in accordance herewith.

(d) + Notwithstanding the definition of the term “Shares” above, the
right of first refusal in this Section 6 shall not be applicable to: (i) the issuance of this
Corporations’ shares to the public pursuant to an effective underwritten registration statement
filed under the Act; (ii) the issuance of Excluded Shares; (iii) the issuance of securities in
connection with a bona fide business acquisition of or by this Corporation, whether by merger,
consolidation, sale of assets, sale or exchange of stock or otherwise; (iv) the exercise of any right

B-14
which was not itself a violation of this Section 6(d); or (v) issuances of securities in which a
majority-in-interest of the holders of Preferred Stock and a majority-in-interest of the Founders
agree in writing to waive the preemptive rights granted pursuant to Section 6.

(e) The preemptive rights set forth in this Section 6 may not be
assigned or transferred, except that (i) such rights are assignable by each Preferred Holder to any
whoily-owned subsidiary or parent of, or to any corporation or entity that is, within the meaning
of the Act, an affiliate of such Preferred Holder, and (ii) such right is assignable to a permitted
transferee or assignee of the Preferred Holders.

ANNEX C

Standard Provisions of the

Series C Convertible Participating Preferred Stock
1. Dividend Provisions

(a) The holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock are entitled to
receive cash dividends, out of any assets legally available therefor, prior and in preference to any
declaration or payment of any dividend (payable other than in Common Stock or other securities
and rights convertible into or entitling the holder thereof to receive, directly or indirectly,
additional shares of Common Stock of this Corporation) on the Common Stock of this
Corporation or the Series A Preferred Stock or the Series B Preferred Stock (collectively, the
“Junior Preferred Stock”), at the rate of 8% of the Original Issue Price (as defined below), per
share per annum (as adjusted for any stock splits, subdivisions, stock dividends, combinations,
recapitalizations and the like (collectively, “Recapitalizations”)), payable quarterly on the first
day of January, April, July and October of each year, with the first dividend payable on October
1, 2013. Notwithstanding the above, in lieu of cash payments and at the discretion of this
Corporation, the dividends owed hereunder or any portion thereof may accrue and cumulate to
the benefit of the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock until (i) the payment of dividends on
Common Stock or other Preferred Stock (if any), or (ii) the occurrence of a Liquidation Event (as
defined below), conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock, or a redemption thereof (all pursuant
to the provisions of this Certificate); in which event, the accrued and unpaid dividends shall be
paid to the holders of the Series C Preferred Shares in the manner provided for below with
respect to the relevant event. Until actually paid, the dividends owed hereunder will accrue on
each share of Series C Preferred Stock from the date of issuance, and will accrue from day to
day, whether or not earned or declared. Such dividends will be cumulative so that, if such
dividends in respect of any previous or current annual dividend period, at the annual rate
specified above, have not been paid the deficiency will first be fully paid before any dividend or
other distribution is paid on or declared and set apart for the Common Stock or Junior Preferred
Stock (if any). Any accumulation of dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock will not bear
interest.

(b) After payment of any dividends pursuant to Sections 1(a) above,
and after the payment of any dividends pursuant to Section 1(a) of Annex A and Annex B, any
additional dividends, if so declared at the discretion of this Corporation, will be distributed
among all holders of Common Stock and all holders of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock in proportion to the number of shares of Common
Stock which would be held by each such holder if all shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series
B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock were converted to Common Stock at the
respective conversion prices for such Preferred Stock as then effective.

(c) Each dividend owed under Section 1(a) above and each dividend
declared by the Board of Directors pursuant to Section 1(b) above, will be paid to holders of
record of shares of the Series C Preferred Stock as they appear on the stock register of the
Corporation on the record date, which will be 15 days before the dividend payment date.
Dividends in arrears for any past dividend period may be declared and paid at any time fixed by
the Board of Directors, whether or not a regular dividend payment date, to holders of record of
shares of Series C Preferred Stock as they appear on the stock register on the record date (which
will be 15 days before the anticipated payment date) and all such dividend payments will be
applied in the order in which such accumulated and unpaid dividends were originally due.

2. Liquidation Preference

(a) In the event of a Liquidation Event, the holders of Series C
Preferred Stock are entitled to receive prior and in preference to any distribution of any of the
assets of this Corporation to the holders of Common Stock and holders of any other stock
ranking junior on liquidation to the Series C Preferred Stock by reason of their ownership thereof
(including in preference to the Junior Preferred Stock), out of the assets of the Corporation
available for distribution to its shareholders an amount per share equal to the sum of (A) two (2)
times the Original Issue Price for each outstanding share of Series C Preferred Stock (ie.,
excluding shares of Series C Preferred Stock already converted) and (B) the amount of
accumulated and unpaid dividends (whether or not declared) on such share (subject to
adjustment for Recapitalizations). If upon the occurrence of such event, the assets and funds
thus distributed among the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock are insufficient to permit the
payment to such holders of the full preferential amounts to which they are entitled upon a
Liquidation Event under this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, then the entire
assets and funds of this Corporation legally available for distribution to stockholders will be
distributed ratably among the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock in proportion to the full
preferential amount each such holder is otherwise entitled to receive.

(b) Upon completion of the distribution required by Section 2(a), and
upon completion of the distribution required by Section 2(a) of Annex A and Annex B, all of the
remaining assets of this Corporation available for distribution to stockholders will be distributed
among the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred
Stock and Common Stock pro rata based on the number of shares of Common Stock held or
deemed held by each (assuming full conversion into shares of Common Stock of all such
outstanding Preferred Stock).

(c) (i) For purposes of this Section 2, a “Liquidation Event” will
be deemed to be occasioned by, or to include:

(A) the acquisition of this Corporation by another entity by means
of any one transaction or a series of related transactions (including,
without limitation, any merger, reorganization or consolidation, but
excluding any merger effected exclusively for the purpose of
changing the domicile of this Corporation) in which this
Corporation’s stockholders of record as constituted immediately
prior to such acquisition do not, immediately after such acquisition
(by virtue of securities issued as consideration for this
Corporation’s acquisition or otherwise), hold at least 50% of the
voting power of the resulting or surviving corporation following
such acquisition; (B) any transaction or a series of transactions in
which majority control of this Corporation is transferred to any one

C-2
or more persons or entities through a transfer to such persons or
entities of more than 50% of the Common Stock, on a fully diluted
basis; (C) the sale, lease, pledge or other disposition to any one or
more persons or entities of all or substantially all of the assets of
this Corporation in one transaction or a series of related
transactions; (D) the grant or pledge of an exclusive license to any
one or more persons or entities to all or a substantial part of this
Corporation’s intellectual property that is used to generate all or a
substantial part of the Corporation’s revenues; (E) the closing by
this Corporation of a firm commitment underwritten public
offering of its common stock pursuant to an effective registration
statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”)
(other than a registration statement relating either to the sale of
securities to employees of this Corporation pursuant to its stock
option, stock purchase or similar plan or a transaction pursuant to
Rule 145 promulgated under the Act), the public offering price of
which is not less than $5.00 per share (appropriately adjusted for
recapitalizations effected after the date hereof) and in which the
ageregate net proceeds (after, without limitation, deductions of
underwriters’ commissions and offering expenses) to this
Corporation exceed $27,000,000, which securities are deemed
“covered securities” as such term is defined in Section 18 of the
Act (a “Qualified Public Offering”); or (F) a Triggering Event (as
defined below). The term “Triggering Event” means any of the
following events:

(1) the signing by an authorized officer of this
Corporation of a petition for relief under Title 11, United States Code, as currently in effect or as
amended;

(2) the commencement of any involuntary
bankruptcy case or other proceeding against this Corporation under Title 11, United States Code,
as currently in effect or as amended (provided that if such case or proceeding is dismissed within
60 days after the date of such commencement, then a Triggering Event arising solely pursuant to
this clause as a result of such case or proceeding will be dismissed) or the appointment of a
trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or sequestrator (or other similar official) for this
Corporation or any substantial part of its property;

(3) the making by this Corporation of an
assignment for the benefit of creditors generally; or

(4) the failure or inability of this Corporation to
pay its debts generally as they become due.

(ii) If this Corporation receives consideration in a Liquidation
Event and such consideration is other than cash, its value will be deemed its fair market value as
determined below:

C-3
(A) Securities not subject to an investment letter or
other similar restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of a
stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate):

(1) _ iftraded ona national securities exchange,
the value will be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such market
over the 30-day period ending five days prior to the closing of the Liquidation Event;

(2) if actively traded over-the-counter other than
through the Nasdaq National Market, the value will be deemed to be the average of the closing
bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the 30-day period ending five days prior to the
closing of the Liquidation Event; and

(3) if there is no active public market, the value
will be the fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by a majority of the Board of
Directors.

(B) The method of valuation of securities subject to an
investment letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely
by virtue of a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) will be to make an
appropriate discount from the value determined as above in Section 2(c)(ii)(A) to reflect the
approximate fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by a majority of the Board of
Directors.

(C) The value of assets other than securities will be
their fair market value as determined in good faith by the majority of the Board of Directors.

(iii) Inthe event that the requirements of this Section 2(c) are
not complied with (except with respect to a Triggering Event), this Corporation will forthwith
either:

(A) cause the closing of the Liquidation Event to be
postponed until such time as the requirements of this Section 2(c) have been complied with; or

(B) cancel such transaction, in which event the powers,
preferences, privileges and other rights and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions of the
Series C Preferred Stock will revert to and be the same as such powers, preferences, privileges
and other rights and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions existing immediately prior to
the date of the first notice referred to in Section 2(c){iv) hereof.

(iv) This Corporation shall give each holder of record of
Series C Preferred Stock written notice of an impending Liquidation Event (except for a
Triggering Event) not later than 30 days prior to the stockholders’ meeting called to approve
such transaction, or 30 days prior to the closing of such transaction, whichever is earlier, and
shal! also notify such holders in writing of the final approval of such transaction. The first of
such notices shall describe the material terms and conditions of the impending transaction and
this Corporation will thereafter give such holders prompt notice of any material changes. The
transaction will in no event take place sooner than 20 days after this Corporation has given the

C-4
first notice provided for herein or sooner than 10 days after this Corporation has given notice of
any material changes provided for herein; provided, however, that such periods may be
shortened upon the written consent of the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock that are entitled
to such notice rights or similar notice rights and that represent at least a majority of the voting
power of all then outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock voting as separate class.

3. Conversion

The holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock will have conversion rights as follows
(the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Series C Preferred Stock is
convertible, at the option of the holder thereof and without payment of any additional
consideration, at any time after the date of issuance of such share at the office of this Corporation
or any transfer agent for such stock, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Common Stock as is determined by dividing the applicable Original Issue Price per share (as
defined below) by the Conversion Price (determined as hereafter provided) in effect on the date
the certificate is surrendered for conversion. The initial Conversion Price per share is $1.323
(the “Original Issue Price”). The initial Conversion Price will be subject to adjustment as set
forth in Section 3(e).

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Series C Preferred Stock
will automatically and without further action on the part of this Corporation or any holder of
Series C Preferred Stock be converted into shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Price at
the time in effect for the Series C Preferred Stock immediately upon the earlier of (i) the closing
of a Qualified Public Offering or (ii) the date specified by written consent or agreement of the
holders of at least 60% of the then outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock, each voting as
a single class.

(c) Accumulated Dividends. Accumulated dividends with respect to a
share of Series C Preferred Stock which are accrued and unpaid will, upon conversion of such
share to Common Stock, be paid to the extent assets are legally available therefor and any
amounts for which assets are not legally available will be paid promptly as assets become legally
available therefor; any partial payment will be made pro rata among the holders of Series C
Preferred Stock, as the case may be, then entitled thereto. Such payment of accrued dividends
upon conversion shall be made in cash, or, at the individual option of each converting
stockholder, in Common Stock based on a price per share of Common Stock equivalent to its
then fair market value as determined in good faith by the majority of the Board of Directors.
Notwithstanding the above, if, in connection with an automatic conversion as provided in
Section 3(b)(i) above, the lead underwriter of the Qualified Public Offering determines that
payment of such dividends in cash would be materially detrimental to the success of such
Qualified Public Offering, then regardless of the choice of the individual stockholder, accrued
and unpaid dividends shall be paid in cash only to the extent deemed necessary or desirable by
the lead underwriter.

(d) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Series C Preferred
Stock will be entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 3(a)

C-5
hereof, he, she or it must surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the
office of this Corporation or of any transfer agent for the Series C Preferred Stock, give written
notice to this Corporation at its principal corporate office, of the election to convert the same and
state therein the name or names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common
Stock are to be issued; provided, however, that in the event that the holder of Series C Preferred
Stock notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Corporation shall convert such holder’s Series C Preferred Stock into shares of
Common Stock provided that such holder executes an agreement reasonably satisfactory to the
Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred in connection with such
certificates. This Corporation will, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such
office to such holder of Series C Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder,
a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled as aforesaid. With respect to conversion pursuant to Section 3(a) hereof, such
conversion will be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the
date of such surrender of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person
or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion will be
treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock as of
such date; and with respect to conversion pursuant to Section 3(b) hereof, such conversion will
be deemed to have been made upon the closing of a Qualified Public Offering or immediately
prior to the close of business on the date specified by the holders of at least 60% of the then
outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock, as the case may be, and the person or persons
entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable. upon such conversion will be treated for
all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock as of such date.

(e) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock. The Conversion
Prices of the Series C Preferred Stock will be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

(i) (A) If this Corporation issues, after the date upon which
the shares of Series C Preferred Stock were first issued (the “Purchase Date”), any Additional
Stock (as defined below) without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the
Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock, then the
Conversion Price for Series C Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to each such issuance
shall forthwith (except as otherwise provided in this Section 3(e)(i)) be adjusted to a price equal
to the per share consideration, if any, received or deemed to be received by the Corporation in
connection with the issuance of the Additional Stock.

(B) No adjustment of the Conversion Price will be made
in an amount less than one cent per share, provided that any adjustments that are not required to
be made by reason of this sentence will be carried forward and shal! be either taken into account
in any subsequent adjustment made prior to three years from the date of the event giving rise to
the adjustment being carried forward, or will be made at the end of three years from the date of
the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward. Except to the limited extent
provided for in Sections 3(e)(@)(E)(3) and 3(e)(i)(E)(4), no adjustment of such Conversion Price
pursuant to this Section 3(e)(i) shall have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price above the
Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment.
(C) In the case of the issuance of Common Stock for
cash, the consideration will be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting
any reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by this
Corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

(D) Inthe case of the issuance of the Common Stock for
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash will be
deemed to be the fair value thereof as determined in good faith by a majority of the Board of
Directors irrespective of any accounting treatment.

(E) Inthe case of the issuance (whether on or after the
Purchase Date) of warrants, options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common Stock,
securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock or warrants,
options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or exchangeable securities, the
following provisions will apply for all purposes of this Section 3(e)(i) and Section 3(e)(ii):

(1) The aggregate maximum number of shares
of Common Stock deliverable upon exercise (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to
exercisability, including, without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account
potential antidilution adjustments) of such warrants, options to purchase or rights to subscribe for
Common Stock will be deemed to have been issued at the time such warrants, options or rights
were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the manner
provided in Sections 3(e)(i)(C) and 3(e\i)(D)), if any, received by this Corporation upon the
issuance of such warrants, options or rights plus the minimum exercise price provided in such
warrants, options or rights (without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) for the
Common Stock covered thereby.

(2) The aggregate maximum number of shares
of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of, or in exchange (assuming the satisfaction of
any conditions to convertibility or exchangeability, including, without limitation, the passage of
time, but without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) for any such convertible
or exchangeable securities or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for
such convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof will
be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or such options or rights
were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration, if any, received by this
Corporation for any such securities and related options or rights (excluding any cash received on
account of accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the minimum additional consideration, if
any, to be received by this Corporation (without taking into account potential antidilution
adjustments) upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or the exercise of any related
options or rights (the consideration in each case to be determined in the manner provided in
Sections 3(e)(i)(C) and 3(e)(i)(D)).

(3) In the event of any change in the number of
shares of Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to this Corporation upon
exercise of such options or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such convertible or
exchangeable securities, including, but not limited to, a change resulting from the antidilution
provisions thereof, the Conversion Price, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using

C-7
such options, rights or securities, will be recomputed to reflect such change, but no further
adjustment will be made for the actual issuance of Common Stock or any payment of such
consideration upon the exercise of any such options or rights or the conversion or exchange of
such securities.

(4) | Upon the expiration of any such options or
rights, the termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options
or rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Conversion Price, to the
extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, rights or securities or options or
rights related to such securities, will be recomputed to reflect the issuance of only the number of
shares of Common Stock (and convertible or exchangeable securities that remain in effect)
actually issued upon the exercise of such options or rights, upon the conversion or exchange of
such securities or upon the exercise of the options or rights related to such securities.

(5) | The number of shares of Common Stock
deemed issued and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to Sections 3(e)(i)(E)(1) and
3(e)(i)(E)(2) will be appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or expiration of the
type described in either Section 3(e)(i)(E)(3) or 3(e)(G)(E)(4).

(ii) “Additional Stock” means any shares of Common Stock
issued (or deemed to have been issued pursuant to Section 3(e)(i)(E)) by this Corporation after
the Purchase Date other than:

(A) _ shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to a
transaction described in Section 4(e)(iii) hereof;

(B) — shares of Common Stock issued or issuable
pursuant to a stock option plan, restricted stock plan, agreements or other incentive stock
arrangements approved by the stockholders and a majority of the Board of Directors;

(C) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable to
persons or entities with which the Company has strategic business relationships provided such
issuances are for other than primarily equity financing purposes and have been approved by the
majority of the Board of Directors;

(D) shares of Common Stock issued at the discretion of
the majority of the Board of Directors, to vendors, service providers or suppliers to this
Corporation provided such issuances are for other than primarily equity financing purposes;

(E) shares of Common Stock issued at the discretion of
the Board of Directors to financial institutions or lessors in connection with commercial credit
arrangements, equipment financings or similar transactions provided such issuances are for other
than primarily equity financing purposes;

(F) — shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to the
conversion, exchange or exercise of convertible or exercisable securities outstanding as of the
date hereof (including shares issued or to be issued to Life Sciences Greenhouse of Central PA or
LSGH, LLC (“LSGC’’) and/or to Ben Franklin Technology Partners (“Ben Franklin”) pursuant

C-8

to agreements entered into, or warrants issued, prior to the Purchase Date) or subsequently issued
pursuant to this Section 3(e)(ii); or

(G) — shares of Common Stock the issuance of which was
approved by a majority of the Board of Directors; provided, that the holders of 60% of the then
outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock consent to the exclusion of such shares from the
definition of Additional Stock.

Shares described under Section 3(e)(ii1)(A) through 3(e)(ii)(G) above shall be referred to
herein as “Excluded Shares.”

(iii) Inthe event this Corporation should at any time or from
time to time after the Purchase Date fix a record date for the effectuation of a split or subdivision
of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or the determination of holders of Common Stock
entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock
or other securities or rights convertible into, exchangeable for, or entitling the holder thereof to
receive directly or indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock (the “Common Stock
Equivalents”) without payment of any consideration by such holder for the additional shares of
Common Stock or the Common Stock Equivalents (including the additional shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof), then, as of such record date (or the date of
such dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no record date is fixed), the Conversion Price
will be appropriately decreased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on
conversion of each share of Series B Preferred Stock will be increased in proportion to such
increase in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding and those issuable
with respect to such Common Stock Equivalents; provided, however, that if such record date is
fixed and such dividend is not paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed
therefor, the Conversion Price will be re-computed accordingly as of the close of business on
such record date and thereafter the Conversion Price will be adjusted pursuant to this Section 4 to
reflect the actual payment of such dividend or distribution.

(iv) If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at
any time after the Purchase Date is decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock, then, following the record date of such combination, the Conversion Price will
be appropriately increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion
of each share of such series will be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding
shares.

(f) Other Distributions. In the event this Corporation declares a
distribution payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by this
Corporation or other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred
to in Section 3(e)(ii), then, in each such case for the purpose of this Section 3(f), the holders of
Series C Preferred Stock will be entitled to a proportionate share of any such distribution as
though they were the holders of the number of shares of Common Stock of this Corporation into
which their shares of such Series C Preferred Stock are convertible as of the record date fixed for
the determination of the holders of Common Stock of this Corporation entitled to receive such
distribution.

C-9
(g) Reclassifications. If at any time or from time to time the Common
Stock of this Corporation is changed into the same or a different number of shares of any class or
classes of stock whether by Recapitalization or otherwise (other than a Recapitalization,
reclassification, exchange, reorganization, substitution or merger or sale of assets provided for
elsewhere in Section 2 hereof or this Section 3), provision will be made so that the holders of
Series C Preferred Stock be entitled to receive upon conversion of such shares the kind and
number of shares of stock or other securities or property of this Corporation or otherwise, to
which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of the
Series C Preferred Stock held by such holder would have been entitled on such Reclassification.
In any such case, appropriate adjustment will be made in the application of the provisions of this
Section 3 with respect to the rights of the holders of Series C Preferred Stock after the capital
reorganization such that the provisions of this Section 3 (including adjustment of the Conversion
Price then in effect and the number of shares purchasable upon conversion of the Series C
Preferred Stock) will be applicable after that event as nearly equivalent as may be practicable.

(h) No Impairment. This Corporation will not, by amendment of this
Certificate or through any reorganization, recapitalization, transfer of assets, consolidation,
merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to
avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder
by this Corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the
provisions of this Section 3 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or
appropriate in order to protect the Conversion Rights of the holders of Series C Preferred Stock
against impairment.

(i) No Fractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments.

(i) No fractional shares will be issued upon the conversion of
any share or shares of Series C Preferred Stock, and the number of shares of Common Stock to
be issued will be rounded to the nearest whole share. The number of shares of Common Stock to
be issued upon such conversion will be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of
Series C Preferred Stock the holder is at the time converting into Common Stock and the number
of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such aggregate conversion.

(ii) | Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of
the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 3, this Corporation, at its expense, will promptly
compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and prepare and
furnish to each holder of Series C Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or
readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is
based. This Corporation will, upon the written request at any time of any holder of Series C
Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (A)
such adjustment and readjustment, (B) the Conversion Price at the time in effect, and (C) the
number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property that at the time
would be received upon the conversion of a share of Series C Preferred Stock.

Gj) Notices of Record Date. In the event of any taking by this
Corporation of a record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining
the holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend) or other

C-10
distribution, any right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of stock of any
class or any other securities or property, or to receive any other right, this Corporation will mail
to each holder of Series C Preferred Stock, at least 20 days prior to the date specified therein, a
notice specifying the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such
dividend, distribution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or
right.

(k) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion, Exercise or
Exchange. This Corporation will at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but

unissued shares of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the
shares of Series C Preferred Stock, such number of its shares of Common Stock as will from
time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred
Stock, and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock is not
sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock, in
addition to such other remedies as are available to the holder of the Series C Preferred Stock, this
Corporation will take such corporate action as it deems necessary to increase its authorized but
unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as will be sufficient for such
purposes, including, without limitation, using its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to this Corporation’s Certificate of
Incorporation.

(1) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Section 4 to
be given to the holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock will be deemed given if deposited in
the United States mail, postage prepaid, and (i) upon personal delivery to the party to be notified,
(ii) when sent by confirmed telex or facsimile if sent during normal business hours of the
recipient; if not, then on the next business day, (iii) five days after having been sent by registered
or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or (iv) one (1) day after deposit with a
nationally recognized overnight courier, specifying next day delivery, with written verification of
receipt. All notices shall be addressed to each holder of record at its address appearing on the
books of this Corporation.

4. Voting Rights

The holder of each share of Series C Preferred Stock will have the right to one vote for
each share of Common Stock into which such share of Series C Preferred Stock could then be
converted, and with respect to such vote, such holder will have full voting rights and powers
equal to the voting rights and powers of the holders of Common Stock, and will be entitled,
notwithstanding any provision hereof, to notice of any stockholders’ meeting in accordance with
the Bylaws of this Corporation, and will be entitled to vote, together with holders of Common
Stock, with respect to any matter upon which holders of Common Stock have the right to vote.
Fractional votes will not, however, be permitted and any fractional voting rights available on an
as-converted basis (after aggregating all shares into which shares of Series C Preferred Stock
held by each holder could be converted) will be rounded to the nearest whole number (with one-
half being rounded upward).
5. Protective Provisions

6. Preemptive Rights

Subject to the terms and conditions specified in this Section, each holder of Series A
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and each of the Founders (as
defined below, and collectively for the purposes of this Section, the “Preferred Holder”) has a
right of first refusal with respect to future sales by this Corporation of any Shares (as hereinafter
defined). Each time this Corporation proposes to offer any shares of, or securities convertible

C-13
into or exchangeable or exercisable for any shares of, any class of its capital stock (the “Shares”),
this Corporation will first make an offering of such Shares to each Preferred Holder in
accordance with the following provisions:

(a) _—_ Not less than 30 days prior to such offering, this Corporation will
deliver a notice (the “Notice”) to each Preferred Holder of record stating (i) its bona fide
intention to offer such Shares, (ii) the number of such Shares to be offered, (iii) the price (which
must be in cash) and terms upon which it proposes to offer such Shares; and (iv) the manner of
sale.

(b) By written notification received by this Corporation, within 20
days after receipt of the Notice, the Preferred Holder may elect to purchase or obtain, at the price
and on the terms specified in the Notice, that portion of such Shares that equals the proportion
that the number of shares of Common Stock issued and held, or issuable upon conversion of the
Preferred Stock then held, by such Preferred Holder bears to the total number of shares of
Common Stock of this Corporation then outstanding (assuming full conversion of the Series A
Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock). This Corporation shal] promptly, in writing,
inform each Preferred Holder which purchases all the shares available to it (“Fully-Exercising
Holder”) of any other Shares available due to any Preferred Holder’s election not to purchase
any or all of the Shares available to such holder likewise. During the 10-day period commencing
after receipt of such information, each Fully-Exercising Holder will be entitled to obtain an
amount of Shares of the entire offering which were not subscribed for by other Preferred Holders
which is equal to the proportion that the number of shares of Common Stock issued and held, or
issuable upon conversion of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock then held, by such Fully-
Exercising Holder bears to the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and held, or
issuable upon conversion of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock then held, by all Fully-
Exercising Holders who wish to purchase some of the unsubscribed shares.

(c) If all Shares that Preferred Holders are entitled to obtain pursuant
to Section 6(b) above are not elected to be obtained as provided in such paragraph, this
Corporation may, during the 90-day period following the expiration of the period provided in
Section 6(b) hereof, offer the remaining unsubscribed portion of such Shares to any person or
persons at a price not less than, and upon terms no more favorable to the offeree than those
specified in the Notice. If this Corporation does not enter into an agreement for the sale of the
Shares within such period, or if such agreement is not consummated within 90 days of the
execution thereof, the right provided hereunder will be deemed to be revived and such Shares
will not be offered unless first reoffered to the Preferred Holders in accordance herewith.

(d) Notwithstanding the definition of the term “Shares” above, the
right of first refusal in this Section 6 shall not be applicable to: (i) the issuance of this
Corporations’ shares to the public pursuant to an effective underwritten registration statement
filed under the Act; (ii) the issuance of Excluded Shares; (iii) the issuance of securities in
connection with a bona fide business acquisition of or by this Corporation, whether by merger,
consolidation, sale of assets, sale or exchange of stock or otherwise; (iv) the exercise of any right
which was not itself a violation of this Section 6(d); or (v) issuances of securities in which a
majority-in-interest of the holders of Preferred Stock and a majority-in-interest of the Founders
agree in writing to waive the preemptive rights granted pursuant to Section 6.

C-14
(e) The preemptive rights set forth in this Section 6 may not be
assigned or transferred, except that (i) such rights are assignable by each Preferred Holder to any
wholly-owned subsidiary or parent of, or to any corporation or entity that is, within the meaning
of the Act, an affiliate of such Preferred Holder, and (ii) such right is assignable to a permitted
transferee or assignee of the Preferred Holders.

(f) The term “Founder” means each of Neal G. Simon, Gary Koppel,
Craig Ferris and Michael Brownstein.
