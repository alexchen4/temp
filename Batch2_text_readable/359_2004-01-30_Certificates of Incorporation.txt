B. Designation of Future Series of Preferred Stock

The Board of Directors is authorized, subject to any limitations prescribed by the law of the
State of Delaware, to provide for the issuance of the shares of Preferred Stock in one or more
series, and, by filing a certificate of designation pursuant to the applicable law of the State of.
Delaware, to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each such series,
to fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each such series and any
qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof and to increase or decrease the number of shares
of any such series (but not below the number of shares of such series then outstanding). Subject
to approval by the Board of Directors, the number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock may be
increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock of the corporation entitled to vote,
unless a vote of any other holders is required pursuant to a certificate or certificates establishing a
series of Preferred Stock.

Except as expressly provided in any certificate of designation designating any series of
Preferred Stock pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Article [V, any new series of
Preferred Stock may be designated, fixed and determined as provided herein by the Board of
Directors without approval of the holders of Common Stock or the holders of Preferred Stock, or

without limitation, voting rights, dividend rights, liquidation rights, redemption rights and
conversion rights senior to, junior to or pari passu with the rights of the Common Stock, the

If the certificate of designation creating a series of Preferred Stock so provides,
any shares of a series of Preferred Stock that are acquired by the corporation, whether by
redemption, purchase, conversion or otherwise, so that such shares are issued but not
outstanding, may not be reissued as shares of such series or as shares of the class of Preferred
Stock. Upon the retirement of any such shares and the filing of a certificate of retirement
pursuant to Sections 103 and 243 of the Delaware General Corporation Law with respect thereto,
the shares of such series shall be eliminated and the number of shares of Preferred Stock shall be
reduced accordingly. :
