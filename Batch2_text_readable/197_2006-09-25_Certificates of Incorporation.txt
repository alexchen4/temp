of Common Stock of this corporation) on the Common Stock of this corporation, payable when,
as and if declared by the Board of Directors. Dividends. on each share of Series A Preferred
Stock and Series B Preferred Stock shall accrue_on a daily-basis at the rate of 8.0% per annum of
the Original Issue Price thereof (calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days consisting of
twelve 30-day months) from and including the date of issuance of such share to and including the
liquidation, dissolution or winding.up of this corporation. Such dividends shall accrue whether
or not they have been ‘declared and whether or not there are profits, surplus or other funds of this
corporation legally available-for the payment of dividends. The date on which this corporation

times transfer of such share is made in the stock records maintained by or for this corporation.

(b) After payment of such dividends, any additional dividends or distributions
shall be distributed among all holders of Common Stock and Preferred Stock in proportion to the
number of shares of Common Stock that would be held by each such holder if all shares of
Preferred Stock were converted to Common Stock at the then effective conversion rate.

2. Liquidation Preference.

(a) In the event of any Liquidation Event (as defined below), either vo.
or invol , the holders of cach series of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, én a pari

Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount per Share equal to the sum of the
applicable Original Issue Price (as defined below) for such stries of Preferred’! Stock, plus any
accrued but unpaid dividends on such share. If, upon the occurrence of such event, the Proceeds
thus distributed among the holders of the Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit the
payment to such holders of the full aforesaid preferential amounts, then the entire Proceeds

GDSVF&H\720875.4 2
legally available for distribution shall be distributed ratably among the holders of the Preferred
Stock in proportion to the full preferential amount that each such holder is otherwise entitled to
receive under this subsection (a). For purposes-t Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, “Original Issue Price” shall mear

disposition, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of this

one transaction, or a series of related transactions, with or into another entity (except a merger or
consolidation in which the holders of capital stock of this corporation immediately prior to such
merger or consolidation continue to hold at least 50% of the voting power of the capital stock of
this corporation or the surviving or acquiring entity), (C) the closing of the transfer (whether by
merger, consolidation or in any other manner), in one transaction or a series of related
transactions to which this corporation is a party, to a person or group of affiliated persons (other
than an underwriter of this corporation’s securities), of this corporation’s securities if, after such
closing, such person or group of affiliated persons would hold 50% or more of the outstanding
voting stock of this corporation (or the surviving or acquiring entity), (D) the grant of an
exclusive and irrevocable license of the Company’s intellectual property to a third party or (E) a
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of this corporation; provided, however, that a transaction
shall not constitute a Liquidation Event if: (w) its sole purpose is to change the state of this
corporation’s incorporation; (x) its sole purpose is to create a holding company that will be
owned in substantially the same proportions by the persons who held this corporation’s securities
immediately prior to such transaction; (y) or consolidate this corporation with a wholly owned
subsidiary; or (z) the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of each series of
Preferred Stock elect not to treat such event as a Liquidation Event. Notwithstanding the prior

(A) Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar
restrictions on free marketability covered by (B) below:

(1) If traded on a securities exchange or through the
Nasdaq National Market, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the

GDS VF &IN720875.4 3
securities on such exchange or system over the twenty (20) trading-day period ending three (3)
trading days prior to the closing of the Liquidation Event;

(2) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall
be deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the
twenty (20) trading-day period ending three (3) trading days prior to the closing of the
Liquidation Event; and

(3) If there is no active public market, the value shall be
the fair value thereof, as mutually determined by this corporation and the holders of at least 66
2/3% of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock.

(B) The method of valuation of securities subject to investment
letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of
a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount
from the market value determined as above in (A) (1), (2) or (3) to reflect the approximate fair
market value thereof, as mutually determined by this corporation and the holders of at least 66
2/3% of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of such Preferred Stock.

(iii) In the event the requirements of this Section 2 are not complied
with, this corporation shall forthwith either:

(A) cause the closing of such Liquidation Event to be
postponed until such time as the requirements of this Section 2 have been complied with; or

(B) cancel such transaction, in which event the rights,
preferences and privileges of the holders of the Preferred Stock shall revert to and be the same as
such rights, preferences and privileges existing immediately prior to the date of the first notice
referred to in subsection 2(c)(iv) hereof.

(iv) This corporation shall give each holder of record of Preferred

the stockholders’ meeting called to approve such transaction, or twenty (20) days prior to the
closing of such transaction, whichever is earlier, and shal] also notify such holders in writing of
the final approval of such transaction. The first of such notices shall describe the material terms
and conditions of the impending transaction and the provisions of this Section 2, and this
corporation shall thereafter give such holders prompt notice of any material changes. The
transaction shall in no event take place sooner than twenty (20) days after this corporation has
given the first notice provided for herein or sooner than ten (10) days after this corporation has
given notice of any material changes provided for herein; provided, however, that subject to
compliance with the General Corporation Law such periods may be shortened or waived upon
the written consent of the holders of Preferred Stock that represent at least 66 2/3% of the voting
power of all then outstanding shares of such Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class
and not as separate series, and on an as-converted basis).

3. Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion
rights as follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

GDSVF&H\720875.4 4
(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B
Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date
of issuance of such share, at the office of this corporation or any transfer agent for such stock,
into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by
dividing the applicable Original Issue Price for such series by the applicable Conversion Price
for such series (the conversion rate for a series of Preferred Stock into Common Stock is referred
to herein as the “Conversion Rate” for such series), determined as hereafter provided, in effect
on the date the certificate is surrendered for conversion. The initial Conversion Price per share
for each series of Preferred Stock shall be the Original Issue Price applicable to such series;
provided, however, that the Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B
Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in subsection 3(d).

(b) Automatic Conversion.

(i) Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into
shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Rate at the time in effect for such Preferred Stock
immediately upon the date specified by written consent or agreement of the holders of at least 66
2/3% of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class).

(ii) | Notwithstanding Sections 3(b)(i) above, each share of Preferred
Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Rate at
the time in effect for such series of Preferred Stock immediately upon the corporation’s sale of
its Common Stock in a firm commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to a registration
statement on Form S-1 or Form SB-2 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and in
which the net proceeds to the Corporation exceed $25,000,000 (before deduction of underwriters
commissions and expenses) (a “Qualified Public Offering”).

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to voluntarily convert the same into shares of Common Stock, he or she shall surrender
the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of this corporation or of any
transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to this corporation at its
principal corporate office, of the election to convert the same and shall state therein the name or
names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued. This
corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder
of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for
the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid. Such
conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the
date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons
entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated
for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock as of such date.
If the conversion is in connection with an underwritten offering of securities registered pursuant
to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the conversion may, at the option of any holder
tendering Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters
of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering, in which event the persons entitled to receive
the Common Stock upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have
converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities.
If the conversion is in connection with Automatic Conversion provisions of subsection 4(b)(ii)

GDS VF &H\720875.4 5
above, such conversion shall be deemed to have been made on the conversion date described in
the stockholder consent approving such conversion, and the persons entitled to receive shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record
holders of such shares of Common Stock as of such date.

(d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock for Certain Dilutive
Issuances, Splits and Combinations. The Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock shall be
subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

(i) (A) If this corporation shall issue, on or after the date upon which
this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation is accepted for filing by the Secretary of
State eof the $ State —of Delaware e_(the e “Filing Date”), any Adc Additional Stock {as defined below)
to a series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior- to the issuance of such Additional
Stock, the Conversion Price for such series in effec ct immediately prior to each such issuance
shall forthwith (except as otherwise provj4€d 3 clause (i)) be adjusted to a price determined
by multiplying such Conversion Price b wf the numerator of which shall be the number
of shares of Common Stock Outstanding (as defined below) immediately prior to such issuance
plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received by this
corporation for such issuance would purchase at such Conversion Price; and the denominator of
which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock Outstanding (as defined below)
immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock. For
purposes of this Section 3(d)(i)(A), the term “Common Stock Outstanding” shall mean and
include the following: (1) outstanding Common Stock, (2) Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of outstanding Preferred Stock, (3) Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
outstanding stock options (4) Common Stock issuable upon exercise (and, in the case of warrants
to purchase Preferred Stock, conversion) of outstanding warrants, and (5) Common Stock
issuable upon conversion or exchange of any security (other than any Preferred Stock, stock
options or warrants described in (2) through (4) above) that by its terms is convertible into or
exchangeable for Common Stock or the option to purchase or the right to subscribe for Common
Stock. Shares described in (1) through (5) above shall be included whether vested or unvested,
whether contingent or non-contingent and whether exercisable or not yet exercisable.

(B) No adjustment of the Conversion Price for the Preferred
Stock shall be made in an amount less than $0.001 per share, provided that any adjustments that
are not required to be made by reason of this sentence shall be carried forward and shall be either
taken into account in any subsequent adjustment made prior to three (3) years from the date of
the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward, or shall be made at the end of three
(3) years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward. Except
to the limited extent provided for in subsections (E)(3) and (E)(4), no adjustment of such
Conversion Price pursuant to this subsection 3(d)(i) shall have the effect of increasing the
Conversion Price above the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment.

(C) In the case of the issuance of Additional Stock for cash, the
consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting any
reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by this
corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and salc thereof.

GDSVF&H\720875.4 6
(D) In the case of the issuance of the Additional Stock for a
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be
deemed to be the fair value thereof as determined by the Board of Directors irrespective of any
accounting treatment.

(E) In the case of the issuance of options to purchase or rights
to subscribe for Common Stock, securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for
Common Stock or options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or
exchangeable securities, the following provisions shall apply for purposes of determining the
number of shares of Additional Stock issued and the consideration paid therefor:

(1) The aggregate maximum number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable upon exercise (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to
exercisability, including without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account
potential antidilution adjustments) of such options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common
Stock shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such options or rights were issued and for
a consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in subsections
3(d)(i)(C) and (d)(i)(D)), if any, received by this corporation upon the issuance of such options
or rights plus the minimum exercise price provided in such options or rights (without taking into
account potential antidilution adjustments) for the Common Stock covered thereby.

(2) The aggregate maximum number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of, or in exchange (assuming the satisfaction of any
conditions to convertibility or exchangeability, including, without limitation, the passage of time,
but without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) for, any such convertible or
exchangeable securities or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for
such convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof shall
be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or such options or rights
were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration, if any, received by this
corporation for any such securities and related options or rights (excluding any cash received on
account of accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the minimum additional consideration, if
any, to be received by this corporation (without taking into account potential antidilution
adjustments) upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or the exercise of any related
options or rights (the consideration in each case to be determined in the manner provided in
subsections 3(d)(i)(C) and (d)(i)(D)).

(3) In the event of any change in the number of shares
of Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to this corporation upon exercise
of such options or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such convertible or
exchangeable securities, the Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way
affected by or computed using such options, rights or securities, shall be recomputed to reflect
such change, but no further adjustment shall be made for the actual issuance of Common Stock
or any payment of such consideration upon the exercise of any such options or rights or the
conversion or exchange of such securities.

(4) Upon the expiration of any such options or rights,
the termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options or

GDS VF&H\720875.4 7
rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Conversion Price of the
Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, rights or
securities or options or rights related to such securities, shall be recomputed to reflect the
issuance of only the number of shares of Common Stock (and convertible or exchangeable
securities that remain in effect) actually issued upon the exercise of such options or rights, upon
the conversion or exchange of such securities or upon the exercise of the options or rights related
to such securities.

(5) | The number of shares of Additional Stock deemed
issued and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to subsections 3(d)(i)(D){1) and (2)
shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or expiration of the type
described in either subsection 3(d)(i)(D)(3) or (4).

(ii) | “Additional Stock” shall mean any shares of Common Stock
issued (or deemed to have been issued pursuant to subsection 3(d)(i)(D)) by this corporation on
or after the Filing Date other than:

(A) Common Stock issued pursuant to a transaction described
in subsection 3(d)(ili) hereof;

(B) Common Stock issued to employees, officers, directors,
consultants, contractors or advisors of this corporation and other service providers for the
primary purpose of soliciting or retaining their services pursuant to stock purchase or stock
option plans or agreements or other incentive stock arrangements approved by this corporation’s
Board of Directors;

(C) Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Series B
Preferred Stock and pursuant to a Qualified Public Offering;

(D) Common Stock issued pursuant to the conversion or
exercise of convertible or exercisable securities outstanding on the Filing Date;

(E) Common Stock issued or deemed issued pursuant to
subsection 3(d)(i)(D) as a result of a decrease in the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred
Stock resulting from the operation of Section 3(d); or

(F) Common Stock issued to financial institutions or lessors in
connection with commercial credit arrangements, equipment financings, commercial property
lease transactions, or similar transactions approved by the Board of Directors, provided such
issuances are primarily for other than equity financing purposes.

(iii) In the event this corporation should at any time or from time to
time after the Filing Date fix a record date for the effectuation of a split or subdivision of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock or the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled
to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock or other
securities or rights convertible into, or entitling the holder thereof to receive directly or
indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock (hereinafter referred to as “Common Stock
Equivalents”) without payment of any consideration by such holder for the additional shares of

GDSVF&H\720875.4 8
Common Stock or the Common Stock Equivalents (including the additional shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof), then, as of such record date (or the date of
such dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no record date is fixed), the Conversion Price of
the Preferred Stock shall be appropriately decreased so that the number of shares of Common
Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be increased in proportion to such
increase of the aggregate of shares of Common Stock outstanding and those issuable with respect
to such Common Stock Equivalents.

(iv) If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any time
after the Filing Date is decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of Common Stock,
then, following the record date of such combination, the Conversion Price for the Preferred Stock
shall be appropriately increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on
conversion of each share of such series shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in
outstanding shares.

(e) Other Distributions. In the event this corporation shall declare a
distribution payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by this
corporation or other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred
to in subsection 3(d), then, in each such case for the purpose of this subsection 3(e), the holders
of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any such distribution as though
they were the holders of the number of shares of Common Stock of this corporation into which
their shares of Preferred Stock are convertible as of the record date fixed for the determination of
the holders of Common Stock of this corporation entitled to receive such distribution.

(f) Recapitalizations. If at any time or from time to time there shall be a
recapitalization of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision, combination or merger or sale
of assets transaction provided for elsewhere in this Section 3 or in Section 2) provision shall be
made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon
conversion of the Preferred Stock the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of
this corporation or otherwise, to which a holder of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion
would have been entitled on such recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall
be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 4 with respect to the rights of the
holders of the Preferred Stock after the recapitalization to the end that the provisions of this
Section 3 (including adjustment of the Conversion Price then in effect and the number of shares
purchasable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event as nearly
equivalently as may be practicable.

(g) No Fractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments.

(i) No fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of any
share or shares of the Preferred Stock and the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock to
be issued to particular stockholders, shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share and the
corporation shall pay in cash the fair market value of any fractional shares as of the time when
entitlement to receive such fractions is determined. Whether or not fractional shares would be
issuable upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of
Preferred Stock the holder is at the time converting into Common Stock and the number of
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion.

GDS VF&H\720875.4 9
(ii) | Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the
Conversion Price of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 3, this corporation, at its expense,
shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and
prepare and furnish to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment
or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is
based. This corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of Preferred
Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (A) such
adjustment and readjustment, (B) the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock at the
time in effect, and (C) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other
property that at the time would be received upon the conversion of a share of Preferred Stock.

(h) Notices of Record Date. In the event of any taking by this corporation ofa
record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof
who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend) or other distribution or to
receive any other right, this corporation shall mail to each holder of Preferred Stock, at least
twenty (20) days prior to the date specified therein, a notice specifying the date on which any
such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or right, and the amount
and character of such dividend, distribution or right.

(i) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. This corporation shall at
all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock,
solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock, such
number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, in addition to such other remedies as shall
be available to the holder of such Preferred Stock, this corporation will take such corporate
action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes,
including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval
of any necessary amendment to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

(j) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Section 3 to be
given to the holders of shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed given if deposited in the United
States mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to each holder of record at his address appearing on
the books of this corporation.

herein to the contrary, any downward adjustment of the Conversion Price of any series of

Preferred Stock may be waived, either prospectively or retroactively and either generally or in a
particular instance, by the consent or vote of the holders at least two-thirds of the outstanding
shares of such series of Preferred Stock. Any such waiver shall bind all future holders of shares
of such series of Preferred Stock.

right to one vote for each share of Common Stock into which such Preferred Stock could then be
converted, and with respect to such vote, such holder shall have full voting rights and powers
