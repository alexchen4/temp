Common Stock is issuable upon the exercise of such rights or
options or upon conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities (determined by dividing (x) the total amount, if any,
received or receivable by the Corporation as consideration for the
granting of such rights or options, plus the minimum aggregate
amount of additional consideration payable to the Corporation
upon the exercise of such rights or options, plus, in the case of
such rights or options which relate to Convertible Securities, the
minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any,
payable upon the issue of such Convertible Securities and upon the
conversion or exchange thereof, by (y) the total maximum number
of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such
rights or options or upon the conversion or exchange of all such
Convertible Securities issuable upon the exercise of such rights or
options) shall be less than the applicable Conversion Price with
respect to the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock
and/or Series C Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to the
time of the granting of such rights or options, then the total
maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the
exercise of such rights or options or upon conversion or exchange
of the total maximum amount of such Convertible Securities
issuable upon the exercise of such rights or options shall (as of the
date of granting of such rights or options) be deemed to have been

Convertible Securities, whether or not the rights to exchange or
convert thereunder are immediately exercisable, and the price per
share for which Common Stock is issuable upon such conversion
or exchange (determined by dividing (x) the total amount of
consideration received or receivable by the Corporation for the
issuance or sale of such Convertible Securities, plus the minimum
aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to
the Corporation upon the conversion or exchange thereof, by (y)
the total maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable
upon the conversion or exchange of all such Convertible
Securities) shall be less than the applicable Conversion Price with
respect to the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or
Series C Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to the time of
such issue or sale, then the total maximum number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exchange of all such
Convertible Securities shall (as of the date of the issue or sale of
such Convertible Securities) be deemed to be outstanding and to
have been issued for such price per share, provided that (x) except

be made by reason of such issue or sale.

received by the Corporation therefor, without deducting therefrom
any expenses incurred or any underwriting commissions, discounts

other than cash received by the Corporation shall be deemed to be
the fair value of such consideration as determined by the board of
directors of the Corporation, without deducting therefrom any
expenses incurred or any underwriting commissions, discounts or
concessions paid or allowed by the Corporation in connection
therewith. In case any shares of Common Stock or Convertible
Securities or any rights or options to purchase such Common Stock
or Convertible Securities shall be issued in connection with any

surviving corporation or corporations as the board of directors
shall determine to be attributable to such Common Stock,
Convertible Securities, rights or options, as the case may be.

(4) __ If (x) the purchase price provided for in any right or
option referred to in clause (1) of this subsection (C\e)(iii)(A), or
(y) the additional consideration, if any, payable upon the
conversion or exchange of Convertible Securities referred to in
clause (1) or clause (2) of this subsection (C\e\iiiMA), or (z) the
tate at which any Convertible Securities referred to in clause (1) or
clause (2) of this subsection (C\eXiii(A) are convertible into or
exchangeable for Common Stock, shall change at any time (other
than under or by reason of provisions designed to protect against
dilution), the Conversion Price then in effect hereunder shall
forthwith be increased or decreased to such conversion price as
would have obtained had the adjustments made upon the issuance
of such rights, options or Convertible Securities been made upon
the basis of (a) the issuance of the number of shares of Common
Stock theretofore actually delivered upon the exercise of such
options or rights or upon the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities, and the total consideration received
therefor, and (b) the issuance at the time of such change of any
such options, rights, or Convertible Securities then still outstanding
for the consideration, if any, received by the Corporation therefor
and to be received on the basis of such changed price; and on the
expiration of any such option or right or the termination of any
such right to convert or exchange such Convertible Securities, the
Conversion Price then in effect hereunder shall forthwith be
increased to such conversion price as would have obtained had the
adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights or options or
Convertible Securities been made upon the basis of the issuance of

16
the ahares of Common Stock theretofore actually delivered (and
the total consideration received therefor) upon the exercise of such
rights or options or upon the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities. If the purchase price provided for in any
right or option referred to in clause (1) of this subsection

(Ce iiiA), or the rate at which any Convertible Securities
referred to in clause (1) of this subsection (C)e)iii{A) are
convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock, shall
decrease at any time under or by reason of provisions with respect
thereto designed to protect against dilution, then in case of the
delivery of Common Stock upon the exercise of any such right or
option or upon conversion or exchange of any such Convertible
Security, the conversion price then in effect hereunder shall
forthwith be decreased to such conversion price as would have
obtained had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such right,
option or Convertible Security been made upon the basis of the
issuance of (and the total consideration received for) the shares of
Common Stock delivered as aforesaid.

(B) Incase the Corporation shall at any time subdivide
its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of
shares, the applicable Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred
Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock in
effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall be
proportionately reduced, and conversely, in case the outstanding
shares of Common Stock of the Corporation shall be combined
into a smaller number of shares, the conversion price in effect
immediately prior to such combination shall be proportionately
increased.

(iv) Dividends or Distributions. In case the Corporation shall
(x) declare a dividend upon the Common Stock payable in Common Stock
(other than a dividend declared to effect a subdivision of the outstanding
shares of Common Stock, as described in subsection (C\e)(iii(B) above)
or Convertible Securities, or in any rights or options to purchase Common
Stock or Convertible Securities, or (y) declare any other dividend or make
any other distribution upon the Common Stock payable otherwise than out
of earnings or carned surplus, then thereafter cach holder of Series A
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock
upon the conversion thereof wil! be entitled to receive the number of
shares of Common Stock into which such Series A Preferred Stock,
Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock have been
converted, and, in addition and without payment therefor, each dividend
described in clause (x) above and each dividend or distribution described
in clause (y) above which such holder would have received by way of
dividends or distributions, if continuously since such holder became the
record holder of such Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock

DN: 288242 ~ final 2 17
or Series C Preferred Stock, such holder (a) had been the record holder of
the number of shares of Common Stock then received, and (b) had
retained all dividends or distributions in stock or securities (including
Common Stock or Convertible Securities, and any rights or options to
purchase any Common Stock or Convertible Securities) payable in respect
of such Common Stock or in respect of any stock or securities paid as
dividends or distributions and originating directly or indirectly from such
Common Stock. For the purposes of the foregoing a dividend or
distribution other than in cash shall be considered payable out of earnings
or earned surplus only to the extent that such earnings or earned surplus
are charged an amount equal to the fair value of such dividend or
distribution as determined by the board of directors of the Corporation.

reorganization or reclassification of the capital stock of the Corporation
shall be effected in such a way that holders of Common Stock shall be
catitled to receive stock, securities or assets with respect to or in exchange
for Common Stock, then, as a condition of such reorganization or
reclassification, lawful and adequate provisions shall be made whereby
each holder of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and
Series C Preferred Stock shall thereupon have the right to receive, upon
the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified herein and in lieu of
the shares of Common Stock immediately theretofore receivable upon the
conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock
and Series C Preferred Stock, such shares of stock, securities or assets as
may be issued or payable with respect to or in exchange for a number of
outstanding shares of such Common Stock equal to the number of shares
of such Common Stock immediately theretofore receivable upon such
conversion had such reorganization or reclassification not taken place, and
in any such case appropriate provisions shall be made with respect to the
rights and interests of such holder to the end that the provisions hereof
(including without limitation provisions for adjustments of the Conversion
Price) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as may be, in relation to any
shares of stock, securities or assets thereafter deliverable upon the exercise
of such conversion rights.

(vi) Corrective Actions. If any event occurs as to which in the
opinion of the board of directors of the Corporation the other provisions of
subsection (C\eXiii) are not strictly applicable or if strictly applicable
would not fairly protect the rights of the holders of the Series A Preferred
Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock in
accordance with the essential intent and principles of such provisions, then
the board of directors ghall make an adjustment in the application of such
provisions, in accordance with such essential intent and principles, so as to
protect such rights as aforesaid.

adjustment of the Conversion Price with respect to the Series A Preferred

Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock,
setting forth in reasonable detail the method of calculation and the facts
upon which such calculation is based.

(viii) Exactional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock
shall be issued upon conversion, but, instead of any fraction of a ahare
which would otherwise be issuable, the Corporation shall pay a cash
adjustment in respect of such fraction in an amount equal to the same
fraction of the market price per share of Common Stock as of the close of
business on the day of conversion. “Market Price” shall mean if the
Common Stock is traded on a securities exchange or on The Nasdaq
National Market, the closing price of the Common Stock on such
exchange or The Nasdaq National Market, or, if the Common Stock is
otherwise traded in the over-the-counter market, the closing bid price, in
each case averaged over a period of 20 consecutive business days prior to
the date as of which “market price” is being determined. If at any time the
Common Stock is not traded on an exchange or The Nasdaq National
Market, or otherwise traded in the over-the-counter market, the “market
price” shall be deemed to be the higher of (x) the book value thereof as
determined by any firm of independent public accountants of recognized
standing selected by the board of directors of the Corporation as of tho last
day of any month ending within 60 days preceding the date as of which
the determination is to be made, or (y) the fair value thereof determined in

Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock; and if at any
time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall
not be sufficient to effect the exercise of all such Series A Preferred Stock,
Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock, the Corporation
will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be
necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock
to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes,
including, without limitation, using its best efforts to obtain the requisite
stockholder approval of any necessary amemdment to the Corporation’s
certificate of incorporation.
