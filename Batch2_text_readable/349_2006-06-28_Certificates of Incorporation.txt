The powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights of the
respective classes of the Corporation’s capital stock or the holders thereof and the qualifications,
limitations and restrictions thereof are as follows:

Section 1. Dividends.

(a) The holders of Series A Preferred Stock and the holders of Series B Preferred
Stock, in preference to the holders of any other capital stock of the Corporation (“Junior Stock’),
shall be entitled to receive, but only out of assets of the Corporation that are legally available
therefor, dividends at the rate of 8% per annum (computed on the basis of a 360-day year having
twelve thirty-day months}-of the Initial Issuance Price for such series of Preferred Stock. Such
dividends shall be cumulative, whether or not declared by the Board of Directors, and dividends
thereon shall accriié from and after the date of issuance of such share of Series A Preferred Stock or
Series B Preferred Stock.

(b) Accrued and unpaid dividends on each share of Series A Preferred Stock and

events: (i) the payment of the Liquidation Preference (as defined in Section 2 below) upon the
occurrence of a Liquidation Event (as defined in Section 2 below), (ii) the redemption of such share
pursuant to a redemption effected under Section 3 hereof or (iii) the conversion of such share to
shares of Common Stock pursuant to a conversion effected under Section4 hereof. Accrued
dividends shall be paid, at the option of the Board of Directors (including each of the Preferred
Directors (as defined below)), in either (i) cash or (ii) Common Stock based on the then-current fair
market value of the Common Stock as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors (including
each of the Preferred Directors).

(c) So long as any shares of Preferred Stock are outstanding, without the consent
of the holders of at least seventy percent (70%) of the outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock
(voting together as a single class on an as-converted basis), no dividend, whether in cash, securities
or other property, shall be declared or paid, nor shall any other distribution be made on any Junior
Stock, nor shall any Junior Stock of the Corporation be purchased, repurchased, redeemed, retired or
otherwise acquired for value by the Corporation or any individual, partnership, limited liability

Corporation or (1i) the exercise of the Corporation’s right of first refusal upon a proposed transfer)
until all dividends (set forth in Section l(a) above) on the Preferred Stock shall have been paid. In
the event that the Corporation declares or pays any dividends upon the Common Stock (whether
payable in cash, securities or other property), the Corporation shall also declare or pay, as the case

-3-
3473355_3.DOC
may be, to the holders of the Preferred Stock on a pari passu basis, at the same time it declares or
pays, as the case may be, such dividends to the holders of Common Stock, the dividends that would
have been declared or paid, as the case may be, with respect to the Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of the Preferred Stock had all of the Preferred Stock been converted into shares of
Common Stock immediately prior to the record date for such dividend, or if no record date is fixed,
the date as of which the record holders of Common Stock entitled to such dividends are to be
determined.

Section 2. Liquidation Rights.

(a) Preference. Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the

Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary (each, a “Liguidation Event’), before any distribution

or payment shall be made to the holders of any Junior Stock, each holder of Preferred Stock shall be

eee paid out of the assets of the Corporation an amount in cash per share of Preferred Stock

? -€qual tothe Initial Issuance Price for such series of Preferred Stock plus an amount equal to all

\waseruéd or declared but unpaid dividends on such share (collectively, the “Liquidation Preference’).

If, upon any Liquidation Event, the assets of the Corporation shall be insufficient to make payment

in full to all holders of Preferred Stock of the Liquidation Preference, then the entire assets of the

Corporation legally available for distribution shall be distributed on a pro rata basis among the

holders of Preferred Stock in proportion to the full Liquidation Preference they would otherwise be
entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2(a).

(b) \ Remaining Assets’ After the payment of the full Liquidation Preference as
set forth in Section 2(a) above, the assets of the Corporationegilly available-for distribution, if any,
shall be distributed ratably to the holders of the“Common Stock and the Preferred Stogk (as
determined on an as-converted basis). nal

(c) Additional Liquidation Events. The following events shall each be
considered a Liquidation Event under this Section 2:

(i) | any consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into any other
corporation or Person, or any other corporate reorganization, in which the shareholders of the
Corporation immediately prior to such consolidation, merger, reorganization, or any similar
corporate transaction, own less than 50% of the Corporation’s voting power immediately after such
consolidation, merger or reorganization, or any other transaction or series of related transactions to
which the Corporation is a party in which in excess of 50% of the Corporation’s voting power is
transferred, excluding any consolidation or merger effected exclusively to change the domicile of the
Corporation (each, an “Acquisition’”); or

(ii) (x) any sale, transfer, lease, assignment, conveyance or other
disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries on a

the transaction) to a third party in any transaction or series of related transactions; or (y) the
exclusive license of all or substantially all of the intellectual property of the Corporation to a third
party in any transaction or a series of related transactions (each, an “Asset Transfer’’).

4.
3473355_3.DOC
(d) Valuation of Consideration. If the consideration received by the
Corporation is other than cash in connection with any of the events set forth above in subsection (c),
its value will be deemed its fair market value (“Fair Market Value’’) on the closing date of any such
event, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors including each of the Preferred
Directors (except in the case of (i)(B) or (ii) below). Fair Market Value of any securities shall be
determined as follows:

(i) Securities not subject to an investment letter or other similar
restrictions on free marketability covered by (ii) below:

(A) If such securities are traded on a securties exchange, the Fair
Market Value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of such securities on such
exchange as of 4:00 p.m. New York time, or, if there have been no sales on any such exchange on
any day, the average of the highest bid and lowest asked prices on all exchanges as of 4:00 p.m. New
York time, or, if such securities are not listed on a securities exchange, the average of the
representative bid and asked prices quoted on the Nasdaq Stock Market as of 4:00 p.m., New York
time, or, if on any day such security is not quoted on the Nasdaq Stock Market, the average of the
highest bid and lowest asked prices on such day in the domestic over-the-counter market as reported
by the National Quotation Bureau, Incorporated or any similar successor organization, in each such
case averaged over a period of 30 days consisting of the business day as of which Fair Market Value
is being determined and the 29 consecutive business days prior to such day;

(B) ‘If at any time such security is not listed on any securities
exchange or quoted in the Nasdag Stock Market System or the over-the-counter market as reported
by the National Quotation Burcau, the Fair Market Value shall be the fair value thereof, as
determined by the Board of Directors and the holders of at least seventy percent (70%) of the voting
power of the then-outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class on an as-
converted basis). If such parties are unable to reach agreement within a reasonable period of time,
such fair value shall be determined by an independent appraiser experienced in valuing securities
jointly selected by the Corporation’s Board of Directors and holders of at least seventy percent
(70%) of the voting power of the then-outstanding Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class
on an as-converted basis). The determination of the appraiser shall be final and binding upon the
parties and the Corporation shall pay the fees and expenses of such appraiser.

(ii) |The method of valuation of securities subject to an investment letter or
other similar restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of a
shareholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate of the issuer of such secunties) shall be to make
an appropriate discount from the market value determined as above in (i) (A) or (B) to reflect the
approximate Fair Market Value thereof, as determined by the Board of Directors, including each of
the Preferred Directors.

(e) Notice of Liquidation Event. The Corporation shall give each record holder
of Preferred Stock written notice of any impending Liquidation Event no later than 20 days prior to
the shareholders’ meeting called to approve such transaction, or 20 days prior to the closing of such
Liquidation Event, whichever is earlier, and shall also notify such holders in writing of the final
approval of such Liquidation Event. The first of such notices shall describe the material terms and

5-
3473355_3.DOC

conditions of the impending Liquidation Event (including, without limitation, the amount of
proceeds to be paid to each share in connection with the Liquidation Event) and the provisions of
this Section 2, and the Corporation shall thereafter give such holders prompt notice of any material
changes to the information set forth in such notice. The Liquidation Event shall in no event take
place sooner than 20 days after the Corporation has given (the first notice provided for herein or
sooner than 20 days after the Corporation has given notice of any material changes provided for
herein; provided, however, that such periods may be shortened upon the written consent of the
holders of Preferred Stock that represent at least seventy percent (70%) of the voting power of all
then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class on an as-converted
basis) and that are entitled to such notice rights or similar notice rights.

(f Effect of Noncompliance. If the requirements of Section 2(e) are not
complied with, the Corporation shall forthwith either cause the closing of the transaction to be
postponed until such requirements have been complied with, or cancel such transaction, in which
event the rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of the Preferred Stock shall revert to and
be the same as such rights, preferences and privileges existing immediately prior to the date of the
first notice referred to in Section 2(e) hereof.

Section 3. Redemption.

(a) Preferred Stock Redemption. At any time after June 30, 2011, the holders
of at least seventy percent (70%) of the then-outstanding Preferred Stock (voting together as a single
class on an as-converted basis) may elect to require the Corporation to redeem, from any source of
funds legally available therefor, all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock (the “Redemption
Option’) in three equal annual installments. Such redemption of the Preferred Stock shall be
effected at a price per share (the “Redemption Price’), paid in cash, equal to the greater of (i)
Liquidation Preference, inclusive of all accrued or declared but unpaid dividends on such share, for
such series of Preferred Stock and (ii) the then-current fair market value of such series of Preferred
Stock as determined in good faith by Board of Directors, including each of the Preferred Directors.

(b) Mechanics of Redemption. Subject to Section 3(d), the Redemption Option
shall be exercised by written notice to the Corporation (the “Redemption Request’) setting forth the
proposed date for the first installment of the redemption of the Preferred Stock, which date (the
“First Redemption Date’) shall not be fewer than 30 nor more than 60 days from the date of such
notice. The First Redemption Date, and each of the two subsequent anniversary dates of the First
Redemption Date are each referred to herein as a ‘Redemption Date.” If any scheduled Redemption
Date falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday observed in the State of Texas, the Redemption
Date shall be the next applicable business day. Within 15 days of the Corporation’s receipt of the
Redemption Request, the Corporation shall mail, at least 15 days but not more than 30 days prior to
the Redemption Date, a notice (a “Redemption Notice’) by means of first class mail, postage paid,
addressed to the holders of record of the shares of Preferred Stock, at their respective addresses then
appearing on the books of the Corporation. The Redemption Notice shall notify such holder of the
redemption to be effected and shall specify (i) the number of shares of Preferred Stock to be
redeemed from such holder, (ii) the applicable First Redemption Date, (iii) the applicable
Redemption Price, and (iv) the place at which such holder shall surrender its shares of Preferred
Stock. The Corporation shall effect such redemptions by paying the applicable Redemption Price in

-6-
3473355_3.DOC
cash in exchange for the shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed. With respect to the second and
third Redemption Dates, the Corporation shall mail, at least 15 days but not more than 30 days prior
to each such Redemption Date, a reminder notice by means of first class mail, postage paid,
addressed to the holders of record of the shares of Preferred Stock, at their respective addresses then
appearing on the books of the Corporation, which reminder notice shall contain the information
required to be contained in the Redemption Notice.

(c) Failure to Redeem Shares on a Redemption Date. If upon the occurrence
of a Redemption Date, the assets of the Corporation legally available to be distributed among the
holders of Preferred Stock for their shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such Redemption
Date shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full aforesaid amounts, then
all of the assets of the Corporation legally available for distribution shall be distributed ratably
among the holders of Preferred Stock in proportion to the applicable Redemption Price amount each
such holder is otherwise entitled to receive. At any time thereafter when additional assets of the
Corporation are legally available for the redemption of Preferred Stock, such assets shall
immediately be used to redeem the balance of the shares of Preferred Stock that the Corporation has
become obligated to redeem on the Redemption Date but which it has not redeemed.

(d) Priority of Redemption. The Corporation shall not redeem shares of
Common Stock or any other shares of its capital stock, if any, prior to the redemption of all
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock. Any redemption effected on a particular Redemption Date
pursuant to this Section 3 shall be made on a pro rata basis among the holders of Preferred Stock in
proportion to the number of shares of Preferred Stock owned by each such holder.

(e) Delivery of Certificates. The holder of any shares of Preferred Stock to be
tedeemed pursuant to the provisions of this Section 3 shall not be entitled to receive payment of the
applicable Redemption Price for such shares until such holder shall cause to be delivered, to the
place specified in the Redemption Notice, (i) the certificates representing such shares of Preferred
Stock (or delivery of a customary affidavit of loss with an indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the
Corporation) and (ii) stock powers or other transfer instrument(s) reasonably satisfactory to the
Corporation and sufficient to transfer such shares of Preferred Stock to the Corporation free of any
adverse interest.

(f) Deposit. At least 10 days prior to a Redemption Date, the Corporation shall
deposit the Redemption Price for the shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such Redemption
Date with a bank or trust corporation having aggregate capital and surplus in excess of $100,000,000
as a trust fund for the benefit of the respective holders of the shares designated for redemption and
not yet redeemed, with irrevocable instructions and authority to the bank or trust corporation to pay
the applicable Redemption Price, for such shares to their respective holders on or after the applicable
Redemption Date upon receipt of notification from the Corporation that such holder has surrendered
its share certificate to the Corporation pursuant to Section 3(e) above. As of the date of such deposit
(even if prior to the Redemption Date but after the date the Redemption Notice is given), the deposit
shall constitute full payment of the shares to their holders plus all accrued and unpaid dividends
thereon, and from and after the date of the deposit, the shares so called for redemption shall be
redeemed and shall be deemed to be no longer outstanding, and the holders thereof shall cease to be
sharcholders with respect to such shares and shall have no rights with respect thereto except the

_7-
3473355_3.DOC
rights to receive from the bank or trust corporation payment of the applicable Redemption Price, of
the shares, upon surrender of their certificates therefor, and the right to convert such shares as
provided in Section 4 hereof. Such instructions shall also provide that any money deposited by the
Corporation pursuant to this Section 3(f) for the redemption of shares thereafter converted into
shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 4 hereof prior to the applicable Redemption Date shall
be retumed to the Corporation forthwith upon such conversion. The balance of any money deposited
by the Corporation pursuant to this Section 3(f) remaining unclaimed at the expiration of one year
following the applicable Redemption Date shal] thereafter be returned to the Corporation upon its
request expressed in a resolution of its Board of Directors.

(g) Termination of Preferred Stock. Upon the redemption of any share of
Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 3, such share shall (provided the applicable Redemption
Price payable upon redemption of such share has been paid or properly provided for in full) be
deemed to cease to be outstanding, and all rights of any Person other than the Corporation in such
share shalf be extinguished on the applicable Redemption Date (including all rights to receive future
dividends with respect to such share), except for the right to receive the Redemption Price, in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 3, subject to applicable escheat laws.

(h) Conversion of Preferred Stock. In the event that any shares of Preferred
Stock shall be converted into Common Stock prior to the close of business on any Redemption Date,
(i) the Corporation shall not be obligated nor have the right to redeem such shares and (ii) any funds
that shall have been deposited for the payment of the Redemption Price with respect to such shares
shall be returned to the Corporation forthwith upon such conversion (less declared dividends payable
to holders of shares of Preferred Stock on the record date for the payment of such dividends,
regardless of whether such shares are converted subsequent to such record date).

Section 4. Conversion. The holders of Preferred Stock shall have the following
conversion rights (the “Conversion Rights’):

(a) Optional Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at
the option of the holder thereof, at the principal corporate office of the Corporation or any transfer
agent for such shares, into such number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Common Stock as is determined, with respect to each share of Preferred Stock, by dividing the
(A) Initial Issuance Price for such series of Preferred Stock by (B) the applicable Conversion Price
(as defined herein) for such series of Preferred Stock in effect on the date the certificate representing
such share is surrendered for conversion. The initial conversion price per share for the Preferred
Stock (the “Conversion Price”) shall be the Initial Issuance Price for such series of Preferred Stock:
provided, however, that the applicable Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock shall be
subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 4(d) below.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be
converted by the Corporation into shares of Common Stock at the applicable Conversion Price in
effect immediately upon the earlier of: (i)except as provided in Section 4(c) below, the
Corporation’s sale of Common Stock in a firm commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to
a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Acf’),
resulting in aggregate gross proceeds (after deducting applicable underwriting discounts and

-8-

3473355_3.DOC
commissions) of at least $35 million; provided, however, that the per share offering price is at least
$5.85 (a “Qualified Public Offering’’) (subject to adjustment for all stock dividends, stock splits,
reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like occurring after the Initial Series B Issuance Date, as
defined below), or (ii) the date specified by written consent or agreement of the holders of at least
seventy percent (70%) of the then-outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (voting together as a single
class on an as-converted basis).

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 4(a) above or upon the
occurrence of the events specified in Section 4(b) above, as the case may be, such holder shall
surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed (or deliver a customary affidavit of
loss with indemnity satisfactory to the Corporation) at the principal corporate office of the
Corporation or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, and in the case of Section 4(a) above, shall
give written notice to the Corporation at its principal corporate office, of the election to convert the
same and shall state therein the name or names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of
Common Stock are to be issued; provided, however, that any failure by a holder to comply with
these provisions shall not have any effect on the automatic conversion of such holder’s shares, which
shall in any event convert in accordance with Section 4(b) above. The Corporation shall, as soon as
practicable thereafter, pay all declared or accrued and unpaid dividends on such shares of Preferred
Stock and issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or
nominces of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to
which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid. The issuance of certificates for shares of Common
Stock upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be made without charge to the holders of
Preferred Stock for any issuance tax in respect thereof or other cost incurred by the Corporation in
connection with such conversion and the related issuance of the Common Stock. Such conversion
shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such
surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the Person or Persons entitled to
receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes
as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock as of such date. The Corporation
shall not close its books against the transfer of Preferred Stock or of shares of Common Stock issued
or issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock in any manner that interferes with the timely
conversion of the Preferred Stock. The Corporation shall assist and cooperate with any holder of
Preferred Stock required to make any governmental filings or obtain any governmental approval
prior to or in connection with the conversion of shares of Preferred Stock (including, without
limitation, making any filings required to be made by the Corporation). Upon conversion of shares
of Preferred Stock into Common Stock, the Corporation shall take all such actions as are necessary
in order to ensure that such shares of Common Stock are validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, and are free and clear of all liens, taxes, charges or encumbrances with respect to the
issuance thereof. If the conversion is in connection with an underwritten offering of securities
registered pursuant to the Securities Act, the conversion shall be conditioned upon the closing with
the underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering, in which event the Person(s)
entitled to receive the Common Stock upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to
have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities.

adjustments based thereon, shall, upon any such increase or decrease becoming effective, be
recomputed to reflect such increase or decrease insofar as it affects such Options or the rights of
conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities (provided, however, that no such
adjustment of the applicable Conversion Price shall affect Common Stock previously issued upon
conversion of such serics of Preferred Stock); and

(C) no readjustment pursuant to clause (A) or (B) above shall have
the effect of increasing the applicable Conversion Price to an amount that excceds the lesser of (1)
the applicable Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock on the Initial Series B Issuance
Date and (2) the applicable Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock that would have
resulted from any issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock between the Initial Series B
Issuance Date and such readjustment date.

(iv) Adjustment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional
Shares of Common Stock. In the event the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the
Initial Series B Issuance Date shall issue Additional Shares of Common Stock {including Additional _
Shares of Common, Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to Section 4(d)iii)) without consideration or
for consideration per share less than the applicable Conversion Price for a series“of Preferred Stock
in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such issue, then the applicable Conversion Price for
such series of Preferred Stock shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to
the nearest cent) determined by, multiplying the applicable Conversion Price for such series of
Preferred Stock, then in effect by a fraction, (A) the numerator of which shall be the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding imniediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares
of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for the total
number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued would purchase at the applicable
Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock, in effect immediately prior to such issuance, and
(B) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of such Additional Shares of Common Stock so
issued. For purposes of the above calculation, the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to such issuance shall be calculated on a fully diluted basis, as if all Convertible
Securities had been fully converted into shares of Common Stock and any outstanding Options had
been fully exercised (and the resulting securities fully converted into shares of Common Stock, if so
convertible) as of such date.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this Section 4(d),
the consideration received by the Corporation in connection with the issuance of any Additional
Shares of Common Stock shall be computed as follows:

(A) Cash and Property. Such consideration shall:

(1) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
aggregate amount of cash received by the Corporation, excluding amounts paid or payable for
accrued interest or accrued dividends;

(2) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair value thereof at the time of such issuance, as determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors and approved by the holders of at least seventy percent (70%) of the then issued
and outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class on an as-converted
basis); and

(3) in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock are
issued together with other securities or property of the Corporation for consideration which covers
both cash and property, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in
clauses (1) and (2) above, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors and approved by the
holders of at least seventy percent (70%) of the then issued and outstanding shares of Preferred
Stock (voting together as a single class on an as-converted basis).

(B) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per

share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been

-]2-
3473355_3.DOC

2

issued pursuant to Section 4(d)(iii) relating to Options and Convertible Securities shall be
determined by dividing:

(1) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the
Corporation as consideration for the issuance of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the
minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating
thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein designed to protect against dilution)
payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such
Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, by

(2) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as
set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein
designed to protect against dilution) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the
exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities.

(e) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Initial Series B Issuance Date effects a
subdivision (by any stock split or otherwise) of the outstanding Common Stock without a
corresponding subdivision of the Preferred Stock, the applicable Conversion Price for such series of
Preferred Stock in effect immediately before such subdivision shall be proportionately decreased.
Conversely, in the event the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Initial Series B
Issuance Date combines the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares
without a corresponding combination of the Preferred Stock, the applicable Conversion Price for
such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately before the combination shall be proportionately
increased. Any adjustment under this Section 4(e) shall become effective at the close of business on
the date such subdivision or combination becomes effective.

(f) Adjustment for Common Stock Dividends and Distributions. In the event
the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Initial Series B Issuance Date declares, or
fixes a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend
or other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock, in each such event the
applicable Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock that is then in effect shall be
decreased as of the time of such issuance or, in the event such record date is fixed, as of the close of
business on such record date, by multiplying the applicable Conversion Price for such series of
Preferred Stock then in effect by a fraction (i) the numerator of which is the total number of shares
of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close
of business on such record date and (ii) the denominator of which is (A) the total number of shares
of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close
of business on such record date, plus (B) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in
payment of such dividend or distribution; provided, however, that if such record date is fixed and
such dividend is not fully paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the
applicable Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock shall be recomputed accordingly as of
the close of business on such record date and thereafter the applicable Conversion Price for such

-]3-

3473355 3.D0C
series of Preferred Stock shall be adjusted pursuant to this Section 4(f) to reflect the actual payment
of such dividend or distribution.

(g) Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. Subject to Section
A.1, in the event the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Initial Series B Issuance
Date shall make or issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock
entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the Corporation (other
than shares of Common Stock) or in cash or other property (other than cash out of earnings or eamed
surplus, determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles), then and in each
such event, the holders of Preferred Stock shall entitled to a proportionate share of any such
distribution as though they were holders of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation in which
their shares of Preferred Stock are convertible as of the record date fixed for determination of the
holders of Common Stock of the Corporation entitled to receive such dividend or distribution.

(h) Adjustments for Recapitalizations, Reclassifications or Other Changes. If
at any time after the Initial Series B Issuance Date, the Common Stock issuable upon the conversion
of the Preferred Stock is changed into the same or a different number of shares of any other class or
classes of stock, whether by recapitalization, reclassification or otherwise (other than an Acquisition
or Asset Transfer or a subdivision, combination, or reorganization provided for elsewhere in this
Section 4), in any such event each holder of Preferred Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert
such stock into the kind and amount of stock and other securities and property that would be
receivable upon such recapitalization, reclassification or other change by holders of the maximum
number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Preferred Stock could have been
converted immediately prior to such recapitalization, reclassification or change, all subject to further
adjustment as provided herein or with respect to such other securities or property by the terms
thereof. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions
of this Section 4 with respect to the rights of the holders of each series of Preferred Stock after the
recapitalization to the end that the provisions of this Section 4 (including adjustment of the
applicable Conversion Price then in effect and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of
each series of Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event as nearly equivalent as prior to
that event as may be practicable.

(i) Adjustments for Reorganizations, Mergers or Consolidations. If at any
time after the Initial Series B Issuance Date, there is a capital reorganization of the Common Stock
or a merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into another Person (other than an
Acquisition or Asset Transfer) as a part of such capital reorganization, merger or consolidation,
provision shall be made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to
receive upon conversion of the Preferred Stock the number of shares of stock or other securities or
property of the Corporation or otherwise to which a holder of Common Stock, deliverable upon
conversion thereof, would have been entitled on such capital reorganization, merger or
consolidation, subject to adjustment in respect of such stock or securities by the terms thereof. In
any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this
Section 4 with respect to the rights of the holders of Preferred Stock after such capital
reorganization, merger or consolidation to the end that the provisions of this Section 4 (including
adjustment of the applicable Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock) then in effect and

-14-
3473355_3.DOC
the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that
event and be as nearly equivalent as practicable.

(j) Adjustment Threshold and Recording. No adjustment in the applicable
Conversion Price for a series of Preferred Stock need be made if such adjustment would result in a
change in such Conversion Price of less than $0.01. Any adjustment of less than $0.01 which is not
made shall be carried forward and shall be made at the time of and together with any subsequent
adjustment which, on a cumulative basis, amounts to an adjustment of $0.01 or more in such
applicable Conversion Price. All calculations under this Section 4 shall be made to the nearest one
hundredth of a cent ($0.0001) or to the nearest one hundredth (1/100) of a share, as the case may be.

(k) Other Distributions. In the event that the Corporation, at any time or from
time to time after the Initial Series B Issuance Date, declares a distribution payable in securities of
other Persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by the Corporation or other Persons, or assets of the
Corporation (excluding cash dividends), then in each such case for the purpose of this Section 4(k),
the holders of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any such distribution
as though they were the holders of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation into
which their shares of Preferred Stock are convertible as of the record date fixed for the determination
of the holders of Common Stock of the Corporation entitled to receive such distribution.

(1) No Impairment. The Corporation shall not, by amendment of these
Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (by merger, consolidation or otherwise) or through
any reorganization, recapitalization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or
sale of securities or otherwise, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the
terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Corporation, but shall at all times in good faith
assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Section 4 and in the taking of all such action as
may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holders of Preferred
Stock against impairment.

(m) No Fractional Shares. No fractional! shares shall be issued upon the
conversion of any share or shares of Preferred Stock, and the number of shares of Common Stock to
be issued shall be rounded to the nearest whole share (with 0.5 being rounded up). Whether or not
fractional shares are issuable upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total
number of shares of Preferred Stock which the holder is at the time converting into Common Stock
and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such aggregate conversion.

(n) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of a Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation, at its expense, shall
promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and prepare
and furnish to each holder of such series of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment
or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is
based. The Corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock,
furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a certificate setting forth (A) such adjustment and
readjustment, (B) the applicable Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock at the time in
effect and (C) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount of other property, if any,
which at the time would be received upon the conversion of a share of Preferred Stock.

-15-

(0) Notices of Record Date. In the event of any taking by the Corporation of a
record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof
who are entitled to receive any dividend or other distribution, any right to subscribe for, purchase or
otherwise acquire any shares of stock of any class or any other securities or property, or to receive
any other right, the Corporation shall mail to each holder of Preferred Stock, at least 20 days prior to
the date specified therein, a notice specifying the date on which any such record is to be taken for the
purpose of such dividend, distribution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend.
distribution or right.

(p) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at
all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock,
solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of Preferred Stock, such number of its
shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock, in addition to such other remedies as shall be available to the holder of
such Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall take such corporate action as may be necessary, in the
reasonable opinion of its counsel, to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to
such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including, without limitation, using
its best efforts to obtain the requisite shareholder approval of any necessary amendment to these
Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation. The Corporation shall also use its best efforts to
take all such actions as may be necessary to ensure that all shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of the Preferred Stock may be so issued without violation of any applicable law or
governmental regulation or any requirements of any securities exchange or quotation system upon
which shares of Common Stock may be listed or quoted, as the case may be; provided, however, that
this sentence shall not require the Corporation to register any of the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock under the federal securities laws. The Corporation
shall use its best efforts to not take any action that would cause the number of authorized but
unissued shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock to be less than
the number of such shares required to be reserved hereunder for conversion of Preferred Stock.

(q) Certain Events. If any event occurs of the type contemplated by the
provisions of this Section 4 but not expressly provided for by such provisions (including, without
limitation, the granting of stock appreciation rights, phantom stock rights or other rights with equity
features), then the Corporation’s Board of Directors shall make an appropriate adjustment in the
applicable Conversion Price so as to protect the rights of the holders of Preferred Stock, provided,
that no such adjustment shall increase the applicable Conversion Price as otherwise determined
pursuant to this Section 4 or decrease the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of each share of Preferred Stock.

(r) Notices. Any notice, request, demand or other communication required or
permitted to be given to a holder of Preferred Stock pursuant to the provisions of these Amended and
Restated Articles of Incorporation will be in writing and will be effective and deemed given under
this Section 4 on the earliest of: (i) the date of personal delivery, (ii) the date of transmission by
facsimile, with confirmed transmission and receipt, (iii) two days after deposit with a nationally-
recognized courier or overnight service and (iv) five days after mailing via certified mail, return

-16-

other charges prepaid and properly addressed to the party to be notified at the address set forth for
such party in the records of the Corporation. Any holder of Preferred Stock (and such holder’s
permitted assigns) may change such holder’s address for receipt of future notices hereunder by
giving written notice to the Corporation.

Section 5. Voting Rights.

(a) General. Except as otherwise provided herein or required by law, holders of
the Preferred Stock shall be cntitled to vote together with the shares of the Common Stock of the
Corporation and not as a separate class on all matters submitted to a vote of the holders of shares of
Common Stock, and may act by written consent in the same manner as the Common Stock, with
each holder of shares of Preferred Stock entitled to the number of votes as shall be equal to the
number of shares of Common Stock into which such holder’s aggregate number of shares of
Preferred Stock are convertible pursuant to Section 4 immediately after the close of business on the
record date for the determination of the shareholders entitled to vote on such matters or, if no such
record date is established, at the date such vote is taken. Each holder of Preferred Stock shall be
entitled, notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, to notice of any shareholders’ meeting
in accordance with the Bylaws of the Corporation. Fractional votes shall not, however, be permitted
and any fractional voting rights resulting from the above formula shall be rounded to the nearest
whole number (with one-half rounded upward to one).

(b) Preferred Stock Protective Provisions: General. In addition to any other

to the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to further limit or eliminate
the liability of directors) and shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the
Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent

Section 2. Indemnification.

(a) | Each person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to, or
testifies or otherwise participates in, any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, arbitrative or investigative, any appeal in such an
action, suit or proceeding, and any inquiry or investigation that could lead to such an action, suit, or
proceeding (any of the foregoing hereinafter called a “proceeding’’), whether or not by or in the right
of the Corporation, because such person is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or, while a
director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, partner, venturer, proprietor, trustee, employee, agent or similar functionary of
another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, proprietorship, trust, employee
benefit plan, other enterprise or other entity (hereinafter a “Covered Person’) shall be indemnified
by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable law, as the same exists
or may hereafter be changed, against all judgments, penalties (including excise and similar taxes),
fines, settlements and reasonable expenses (including attorneys’ fees and court costs) actually
incurred by such person in connection with such proceeding, and such right to indemnification shall
continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, partner, venturer, proprietor, trustee,
employee, agent or similar functionary and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors
and administrators; provided, however, that, except for proceedings to enforce rights to
indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify a Covered Person in connection with a proceeding
(or part thereof) initiated by such Covered Person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was
authorized by the Board. The right to indemnification conferred by this Section 2 shall be a contract
right and shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending or
otherwise participating in any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition.

(b) The rights conferred on any Covered Person by this Section 2 shall not be
exclusive of any other rights which any Covered Person may have or hereafter acquire under law,
these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, the bylaws of the Corporation, an agreement,
vote of shareholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

(c) | Any repeal or amendment of this Section2 by the shareholders of the
Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of these Amended and
Restated Articles of Incorporation inconsistent with this Section 2, will, unless otherwise required by
law, be prospective only (except to the extent such amendment, change in law or adoption permits
the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than permitted prior
thereto), and will not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection existing at the
time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect of any act or
omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

(d) = This Section 2 shall not limit the right of the Corporation, to the extent and in
the manner authorized or permitted by law, to indemnify and to advance expenses to persons other
than Covered Persons.
