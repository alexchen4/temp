The Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock shall collectively be referred to as the
“Series Preferred”.

D. The rights, preferences, privileges, restrictions and other matters relating to the
Series Preferred are as follows:

1. DIVIDEND RIGHTS.

(a) Holders of Series Preferred, in preference to the holders of
Common Stock, shall be entitled to receive, when and as declared by the Board of Directors (the
“Board”), but only out of funds that are legally available therefor, cash dividends at the rate of
eight percent (8%) of the applicable Original Issue Price (as defined below) per annum on each
outstanding share of Series Preferred (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits,
recapitalizations and the like with respect to such shares after the filing date hereof). Such
dividends shall be payable only when, as and if declared by the Board and shall be non-
cumulative.

(b) The “Original Issue Price” of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be
$1.00 per share (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and
the like with respect to such shares after the filing date hereof). The “Original Issue Price” of the
Series B Preferred Stock shall be $1.00 per share (as adjusted for any stock dividends,
combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like with respect to such shares after the filing date
hereof).

(c) So long as any shares of Series Preferred are outstanding, the
Company shall not pay or declare any dividend, whether in cash or property, or make any other
distribution on the Common Stock, or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire for value any
shares of Common Stock until all dividends as set forth in Section 1{a) above on the Series
Preterred shall have been paid or declared and set apart, except for:

(i) acquisitions of Common Stock by the Company pursuant to
agreements which permit the Company to repurchase such shares at cost (or the lesser of cost or
fair market value) upon termination of services to the Company; or

(ii) acquisitions of Common Stock in exercise of the
Company’s right of first refusal to repurchase such shares.

(d) —_In the event dividends are paid on any share of Common Stock, the
Company shall pay an additional dividend on all outstanding shares of Series Preferred in a per

539109 v7/HN 2.
share amount equal (on an as-if-converted to Common Stock basis) to the amount paid or set
aside for each share of Common Stock.

(e) The provisions of Sections l(c) and i(d) shall not apply to a
dividend payable in Common Stock, or any repurchase of any outstanding securities of the
Company that is approved by (i) the Board and (ii) if such approval is required by Section 2(b) of
this Article IV, the holders of seventy-five percent (75%) of the outstanding Series Preferred.

(f) The holders of the Series Preferred expressly waive their rights, if
any, as described in California General Corporation Law (“CGCL”) Code Sections 502, 503 and

termination of employment or service as a consultant or director.

2. VOTING RIGHTS.

(a) General Rights. Each holder of shares of the Series Preferred
shall be entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of shares of Common Stock into
which such shares of Series Preferred could be converted (pursuant to Section 4 hereof)
immediately after the close of business on the record date fixed for such meeting or the effective
date of such written consent and shall have voting rights and powers equal to the voting rights
and powers of the Common Stock and shall be entitled to notice of any stockholders’ meeting in
accordance with the bylaws of the Company. Except as otherwise provided herein or as required
by law, the Series Preferred shall vote together with the Common Stock at any annual or special
meeting of the stockholders and not as a separate class, and may act by written consent in the
same manner as the Common Stock.

(b) Separate Vote of Series Preferred. In addition to any other vote
or consent required herein or by law, the vote or written consent of the holders of at least
seventy-five percent (75%) of the outstanding Series Preferred shall be necessary for effecting or
validating the following actions (whether such actions are effected by amendment, merger,
consolidation, reorganization or otherwise):

(i) Any amendment, alteration, or repeal of any provision of
the Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Company (including any filing of a
Certificate of Designation and including such an amendment alteration or repeal effected by
merger, consolidation or other reorganization) that adversely alters or changes the voting or other
powers, preferences, or other special rights, privileges or restrictions of the Series Preferred;

(ii) Any increase or decrease in the authorized number of
shares of Preferred Stock;

(iii) Any authorization or any designation, whether by
reclassification or otherwise, of any new class or series of stock or any other securities
convertible or exchangeable into equity securities of the Company ranking on a parity with or
senior to any series of Series Preferred in right of redemption, liquidation preference, conversion,

539109 v7/HN 3.
voting or dividends or any increase in the authorized or designated number of any such new class
or series;

(iv) Any redemption, repurchase, payment of dividends or other
distributions with respect to Common Stock (except for dividends paid in Common Stock or
acquisitions of Common Stock by the Company permitted by Section 1 hereof);

(v) Any agreement by the Company or its stockholders
regarding (i) an Acquisition (as defined in Section 4(b)) or (ii) an Asset Transfer (as defined in
Section 4(b));

(vi) Any increase or decrease in the number of shares of
Common Stock authorized for issuance under the Company’s 2003 Equity Incentive Plan (or any
similar successor stock purchase or stock option plans adopted by the Company) (the “Plan”);

(vii) Any increase or decrease in the authorized number of
members of the Company’s Board; or

(viii) Any sale or issuance of Series Preferred, except for the
issuance of Series B Preferred Stock pursuant to that certain Series B Preferred Stock Purchase
Agreement dated on or about the date hereof.

(c) Election of Board of Directors.

(i) The holders of Series Preferred, voting as a separate class,
shall be entitled to elect one (1) member of the Board at each meeting or pursuant to each
consent of the Company’s stockholders for the election of directors, and to remove from office
such directors and to fill any vacancy caused by the resignation, death or removal of such
directors;

(ii) — the holders of Common Stock, voting as a separate class,
shall be entitled to elect one (1) member of the Board at each meeting or pursuant to each
consent of the Company’s stockholders for the election of directors, and to remove from office
such directors and to fill any vacancy caused by the resignation, death or removal of such
directors; and

(iii) the holders of Common Stock and Series Preferred, voting
together as a single class on an as-if-converted basis, shall be entitled to elect all remaining
members of the Board at each meeting or pursuant to each consent of the Company’s
stockholders for the election of directors, and to remove from office such directors and to fill any
vacancy caused by the resignation, death or removal of such directors.

(iv) No person entitled to vote at an election for directors may
cumulate votes to which such person is entitled, unless, at the time of such election, the
Company is subject to Section 2115 of the CGCL. During such time or times that the Company
is subject to Section 2115(b) of the CGCL, every stockholder entitled to vote at an election for
directors may cumulate such stockholder’s votes and give one (1) candidate a number of votes

539109 v7/HN 4.
equal to the number of directors to be elected multiplied by the number of votes to which such
stockholder’s shares are otherwise entitled, or distribute the stockholder’s votes on the same
principle among as many candidates as such stockholder desires. No stockholder, however, shall
be entitled to so cumulate such stockholder’s votes unless (i) the names of such candidate or
candidates have been placed in nomination prior to the voting and (ii) the stockholder has given
notice at the meeting, prior to the voting, of such stockholder’s intention to cumulate such
stockholder’s votes. If any stockholder has given proper notice to cumulate votes, all
stockholders may cumulate their votes for any candidates who have been properly placed in
nomination. Under cumulative voting, the candidates receiving the highest number of votes, up
to the number of directors to be elected, are elected.

(v) Removal. During such time or times that the Company is
subject to Section 2115(b) of the CGCL, one or more directors may be removed from office at
any time without cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the
outstanding shares entitled to vote for that director as provided above; provided, however, that
unless the entire Board is removed, no individual director may be removed when the votes cast
against such director’s removal, or not consenting in writing to such removal, would be sufficient
to elect that director if voted cumulatively at an election which the same total number of votes
were cast (or, if such action is taken by written consent, all shares entitled to vote were voted)
and the entire number of directors authorized at the time of such director’s most recent election
were then being elected.

3. LIQUIDATION RIGHTS.

(a) Upon any Acquisition (as defined below), Asset Transfer (as
defined below) or any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary
or involuntary (each of the foregoing, a “Liquidation Event”), before any distribution or payment
shall be made to the holders of any Common Stock, the holders of Series Preferred shall be
entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Company legally available for distribution, or the
consideration received in such transaction, for each share of Series Preferred held by them, on a
pari passu basis, an amount per share of Series Preferred equal to the applicable Original Issue
Price plus all declared and unpaid dividends on the Series Preferred on such share (as adjusted
for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like with respect to such
shares after the filing date hereof). [f, upon any such Liquidation Event, the assets of the
Company (or the consideration received in such transaction) shall be insufficient to make
payment in full to all holders of Series Preferred of the liquidation preference set forth in this
Section 3(a), then such assets (or consideration) shall be distributed among the holders of Series
Preferred at the time outstanding, ratably in proportion to the full amounts to which they would
otherwise be respectively entitled pursuant to this Section 3(a).

(b) After the payment of the full liquidation preference of the Series
Preferred as set forth in Section 3(a) above, the assets of the Company legally available for
distribution in such Liquidation Event (or the consideration received by the Company or its
stockholders in such transaction), if any, shall be distributed ratably to the holders of the
Common Stock and Series Preferred on an as-if-converted to Common Stock basis until such
holders of Series Preferred have received pursuant to Section 3(a) above and this Section 3(b) an

539109 v7/HN 5.
aggregate amount per share of Series Preferred equal to two (2) times the applicable Original
Issue Price; thereafter, the remaining assets of the Company legally available for distribution in
such Liquidation Event (or the consideration received in such transaction), if any, shall be
distributed ratably to the holders of the Common Stock.

4. ASSET TRANSFER OR ACQUISITION RIGHTS.

(a) Notwithstanding Section 3(a) and Section 3(b) above, solely for
purposes of determining the amount each holder of Series Preferred is entitled to receive with
respect to an Acquisition or Asset Transfer, at the closing of any Acquisition or Asset Transfer
with respect to which amounts are to be legally distributed to the Company’s stockholders and at
each date after such closing on which additional amounts (such as earnout payments, escrow
amounts or other contingent payments) are to be legally distributed to the Company’s
stockholders as a result of such Acquisition or Asset Transfer (each, a “Payment Date”), each
holder of Series Preferred shall be entitled to be paid, out of the assets of the Company legally
available for distribution (or the consideration received in such transaction) on such Payment
Date, an amount for each share of Series Preferred held upon the closing of such Liquidation
Event equal to: (a) the greater of the amount of cash, securities and other property to which such
holder would have been entitled (after taking into account the operation of this Section 4(a) with
respect to all series of Series Preferred and treating the distributions to the Company’s
stockholders made upon such Payment Date and all prior Payment Dates as having been made
simultaneously upon the closing of the Acquisition or the Asset Transfer): (i) pursuant to Section
3(a) above or (ii) if all shares of Series Preferred had converted to Common Stock pursuant to
Section 5 as of immediately prior to the closing of such Acquisition or Asset Transfer; reduced
by (b) the amount per share paid in the aggregate to such holder with respect to such holder’s
Series Preferred on all prior Payment Dates; provided, however, that the fair market value of any
non-cash consideration that may be distributed to the Company’s stockholders on each Payment
Date shall be determined at the date of the closing of the Acquisition or Asset Transfer in
accordance with Section 4(c).

(b) For the purposes of this Section 4: (i) “Acquisition” shall mean (A)
any consolidation or merger of the Company with or into any other corporation or other entity or
person, or any other corporate reorganization, in which the stockholders of the Company
immediately prior to such consolidation, merger or reorganization, own less than 50% of the
voting power of the surviving entity immediately after such consolidation, merger or
reorganization or (B) any transaction or series of related transactions (whether by merger,
consolidation, stock exchange or otherwise) in which fifty percent (50%) or more of the
Company’s voting power is transferred; provided that an Acquisition shall not include (x) any
consolidation or merger effected exclusively to change the domicile of the Company, (y) any
consolidation or merger with a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company for the primary purpose
of creating a holding company that will be owned substantially in the same proportions by the
persons and entities that hold this Company’s securities immediately prior to such trasaction, or
(z) any transaction or series of transactions principally for bona fide equity financing purposes in
which the Company is the surviving corporation; and (ii) “Asset Transfer” shall mean a sale,
lease, conveyance, exclusive license or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of
the Company.

539109 v7/HN 6.
(c) In any Acquisition or Asset Transfer, if the consideration to be
received is securities of a corporation or other property other than cash, its value will be deemed
its fair market value. Any securities shall be valued as follows:

(i) Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar
restrictions on free marketability:

(A) _ If traded on a securities exchange or The Nasdaq
Stock Market (‘“Nasdaq’’), the value shall be based on a formula approved by the Board and
derived from the closing prices of the securities on such exchange or Nasdaq over a specified
time period;

(B) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall
be based on a formula approved by the Board and derived from the closing bid or sales prices
(whichever is applicable) of such securities over a specified time period; and

(C) _ If there is no active public market, the value shall be
the fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board.

(ii) The method of valuation of securities subject to
investment letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely
by virtue of a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an
appropriate discount from the market value determined as specified above in Section 4(c){i) to
reflect the approximate fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board.

5. CONVERSION RIGHTS.

The holders of the Series Preferred shall have the following rights with
respect to the conversion of the Series Preferred into shares of Common Stock (the “Conversion
Rights’):

(a) Optional Conversion. Subject to and in compliance with the
provisions of this Section 5, any shares of Series Preferred may, at the option of the holder, be
converted at any time into fully-paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock. The number
of shares of Common Stock to which a holder of Series Preferred shall be entitled upon
conversion shall be the product obtained by multiplying the “Series Preferred Conversion Rate”
then in effect for such series (determined as provided in Section 5(b)) by the number of shares of
Series Preferred being converted.

(b) Series Preferred Conversion Rate. The conversion rate in effect
at any time for conversion of any series of Series Preferred (the “Series Preferred Conversion
Rate” for such series) shall be the quotient obtained by dividing the Original Issue Price of such
series of Series Preferred by the applicable “Series Preferred Conversion Price,” calculated as
provided in Section S(c).

(c) Series Preferred Conversion Price. The conversion price for any
series of Series Preferred shall initially be the Original Issue Price of such series of Series

539109 v7/HN 7.
Preferred (the “Series Preferred Conversion Price”). Such initial Series Preferred Conversion
Price shall be adjusted from time to time in accordance with this Section 5. All references to the
Series Preferred Conversion Price herein shall mean the applicable Series Preferred Conversion
Price as so adjusted.

(d) Mechanics of Conversion. Each holder of Series Preferred who
desires to convert the same into shares of Common Stock pursuant to this Section 5 shall
surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Company or
any transfer agent for the Series Preferred, and shall give written notice to the Company at such
office that such holder elects to convert the same. Such notice shall state the number of shares of
Series Preferred being converted. Thereupon, the Company shall promptly issue and deliver at
such office to such holder a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock
to which such holder is entitled and shall promptly pay (i) in cash or, to the extent sufficient
funds are not then legally available therefor, in Common Stock (at the Common Stock’s fair
market value determined by the Board as of the date of such conversion), any declared and
unpaid dividends on the shares of Series Preferred being converted and (ii) in cash (at the
Common Stock’s fair market value determined by the Board as of the date of conversion) the
value of any fractional share of Common Stock otherwise issuable to any holder of Series
Preferred. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made at the close of business on the
date of such surrender of the certificates representing the shares of Series Preferred to be
converted, and the person entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such
conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such shares of Common Stock
on such date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the conversion is in connection with an
underwritten offering of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering Series Preferred for conversion, be
conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to such
offering, in which event the persons entitled to receive the Common Stock upon conversion of
the Series Preferred shall not be deemed to have converted such Series Preferred until
immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities.

(e) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If at any time
or from time to time after the date that the first share of Series B Preferred Stock is issued (the
“Original Issue Date”) the Company effects a subdivision of the outstanding Common Stock
without a corresponding subdivision of any series of Series Preferred, the applicable Series
Preferred Conversion Price in effect immediately before that subdivision shall be proportionately
decreased. Conversely, if at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date the
Company combines the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares
without a corresponding combination of any series of Series Preferred, the applicable Series
Preferred Conversion Price in effect immediately before the combination shall be proportionately
increased. Any adjustment under this Section 5(e) shall become effective at the close of business
on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective.

(f) Adjustment for Common Stock Dividends and Distributions.
[f at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date the Company pays to holders of
Common Stock a dividend or other distribution in additional shares of Common Stock without a
corresponding dividend or other distribution to holders of Series Preferred, each Series Preferred

539109 v7/HN 8.
Conversion Price that is then in effect shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance, as
provided below:

(i) Each Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be adjusted by
multiplying each Series Preferred Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction equal to:

(A) _ the numerator of which is the total number of shares
of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance, and

(B) the denominator of which is the total number of
shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance
plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or
distribution;

(ii) If the Company fixes a record date to determine which
holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution, the
applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be fixed as of the close of business on such
record date and the number of shares of Common Stock shall be calculated immediately prior to
the close of business on such record date; and

(iii) If such record date is fixed and such dividend is not fully
paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, each Series Preferred
Conversion Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record date
and thereafter each Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this Section
5(f) to reflect the actual payment of such dividend or distribution.

(iv) In the event the Company shall declare a distribution
payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by the Company or other
persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred to in Section 4(e)
above to holders of Common Stock without a corresponding distribution to holders of Series
Preferred, then, in each such case for the purpose of this Section 4(f), the holders of the Series
Preferred shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any such distribution as though they were
the holders of the number of shares of Common Stock of this Company into which their shares of
Series Preferred are convertible as of the record date fixed for the determination of the holders of
Common Stock of this Company entitled to receive such distribution.

(g) Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange, Substitution,
Reorganization, Merger or Consolidation. If at any time or from time to time after the
Original Issue Date, the Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Series Preferred is
changed into the same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by
recapitalization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or otherwise (other than an Acquisition or
Asset Transfer as defined in Section 4 or a subdivision or combination of shares or stock
dividend or a reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale of assets provided for elsewhere in
this Section 5), in any such event each holder of Series Preferred shall then have the right but
shall have no obligation to convert such stock into the kind and amount of stock and other
securities and property receivable upon such recapitalization, reclassification, merger,

539109 v7/HN 9.
consolidation or other change by holders of the maximum number of shares of Common Stock
into which such shares of Series Preferred could have been converted immediately prior to such
recapitalization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or change, all subject to further
adjustment as provided herein or with respect to such other securities or property by the terms
thereof. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the
provisions of this Section 5 with respect to the rights of the holders of Series Preferred after the
capital reorganization to the end that the provisions of this Section 5 (including adjustment of the
applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price then in effect and the number of shares issuable
upon conversion of such Series Preferred) shall be applicable after that event and be as nearly
equivalent as practicable.

(h) Sale of Additional Shares.

(i) If at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue
Date, the Company issues or sells, or is deemed by the express provisions of this Section 5(h) to
have issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock (as defined below), other than as
provided in Section 5(f) or 5(g) above (a “Qualifying Additional Issuance”), then and in each
such case the then existing Series Preferred Conversion Price for a series of Series Preferred shall
be adjusted, as of the opening of business on the date of such issue or sale, to a price determined
by multiplying the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to
such issuance or sale by a fraction equal to:

(A) — the numerator of which shall be (A) the number of
shares of Common Stock deemed outstanding (as determined below) immediately prior to such
issue or sale, plus (B) the number of shares of Common Stock which the Aggregate
Consideration (as defined below) received by the Company for the total number of Additional
Shares of Common Stock so issued would purchase at such then-existing Series Preferred
Conversion Price, and

(B) the denominator of which shall be the number of
shares of Common Stock deemed outstanding (as determined below) immediately prior to such
issue or sale plus the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued.

For the purposes of the preceding sentence, and for the purposes of section 5(h)(ii) below,
the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be outstanding as of a given date shall be the
sum of (A) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding, (B) the number of shares of
Common Stock into which the then outstanding shares of Series Preferred could be converted if
fully converted on the day immediately preceding the given date, and (C) the number of shares of
Common Stock which could be obtained through the exercise or conversion of all other rights,
options and convertible securities outstanding on the day immediately preceding the given date,
but only to the extent the consideration to be paid upon the exercise, conversion or exchange per
share of underlying Common Stock is less than or equal to the Effective Price for the Additional
Shares of Common Stock which has given rise to the Series Preferred Conversion Price
adjustment being calculated.

539109 v7/HN 10.
(ii) | Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shal] the
applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price be adjusted pursuant to Section 5(h)(i) above to a
price that is above the Original Issue Price (as adjusted for stock dividends, combinations, splits,
recapitalizations and the like) for such series. In the event that the Series Preferred Conversion
Price for any series of Series Preferred would be adjusted pursuant to Section S(h)(i) to a price
that is greater than the Original Issue Price, then the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price
shall be deemed for the purposes of this Section 5 to be the Original Issue Price of such series of
Series Preferred (as adjusted for stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the
like). Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the purpose of any calculations or subsequent
adjustments under Section 5(h){i) as a result of the issuance of Additional Stock, each Series
Preferred Conversion Price shall be deemed to be equal to the applicable Series Preferred
Conversion Price as previously calculated in connection with the most immediately preceding
issuance of Additional Stock and without giving regard to the prior sentence. No adjustment
shall be made to the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price in an amount less than one cent
per share. Any adjustment otherwise required by this Section 5(h) that is not required to be made
due to the preceding sentence shall be included in any subsequent adjustment to such Series
Preferred Conversion Price.

(iii) | For the purpose of making any adjustment required under
this Section 5(h), the aggregate consideration received by the Company for any issue or sale of
securities (the “Aggregate Consideration”) shall be defined as: (A) to the extent it consists of
cash, be computed at the net amount of cash received by the Company after deduction of any
underwriting or similar commissions, compensation or concessions paid or allowed by the
Company in connection with such issue or sale but without deduction of any expenses payable by
the Company, (B) to the extent it consists of property other than cash, be computed at the fair
value of that property as determined in good faith by the Board irrespective of any accounting
treatment, and (C) if Additional Shares of Common Stock, Convertible Securities (as defined
below) or rights or options to purchase either Additional Shares of Common Stock or
Convertible Securities are issued or sold together with other stock or securities or other assets of
the Company for a consideration which covers both, be computed as the portion of the
consideration so received that may be reasonably determined in good faith by the Board to be
allocable to such Additional Shares of Common Stock, Convertible Securities or rights or
options.

(iv) For the purpose of the adjustment required under this
Section 5(h), if the Company issues or sells (x) Preferred Stock or other stock, options, warrants,
purchase rights or other securities convertible or exchangeable into, Additional Shares of
Common Stock (such convertible or exchangeable stock or securities being herein referred to as
“Convertible Securities”) or (y) rights or options for the purchase of Additional Shares of
Common Stock or Convertible Securities and, (A) in the case of the adjustment required under
Section 5(h)(i), if the Effective Price of such Additional Shares of Common Stock is less than
any Series Preferred Conversion Price, or, (B) in the case of the adjustment required under
Section 5(h)(ii), if the Effective price of such Additional Shares of Common Stock is greater than
any Series Preferred Conversion Price, in each case the Company shall be deemed to have issued
at the time of the issuance of such rights or options or Convertible Securities the maximum
number of Additional Shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise or conversion or

539109 v7/HN 11.
exchange thereof and to have received as consideration for the issuance of such shares an amount
equal to the total amount of the consideration, if any, received by the Company for the issuance
of such rights or options or Convertible Securities plus:

(A) _ in the case of such rights or options, the minimum
amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon the exercise of such rights or
options; and

(B) in the case of Convertible Securities, the minimum
amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon the conversion or exchange
thereof (other than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible
Securities); provided that if the minimum amounts of such consideration cannot be ascertained,
but are a function of antidilution or similar protective clauses, the Company shall be deemed to
have received the minimum amounts of consideration without reference to such clauses.

(C) If the minimum amount of consideration payable to
the Company upon the exercise or conversion of rights, options or Convertible Securities is
reduced over time or on the occurrence or non-occurrence of specified events other than by
reason of antidilution adjustments, the Effective Price shall be recalculated using the figure to
which such minimum amount of consideration is reduced; provided further, that if the minimum
amount of consideration payable to the Company upon the exercise or conversion or exchange of
such rights, options or Convertible Securities is subsequently increased, the Effective Price shall
be again recalculated using the increased minimum amount of consideration payable to the
Company upon the exercise or conversion or exchange of such rights, options or Convertible
Securities.

(D) No further adjustment of any Series Preferred
Conversion Price, as adjusted upon the issuance of such rights, options or Convertible Securities,
shall be made as a result of the actual issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock or the
exercise of any such rights or options or the conversion of any such Convertible Securities. If
any such rights or options or the conversion privilege represented by any such Convertible
Securities shall expire without having been exercised, the applicable Series Preferred Conversion
Price as adjusted upon the issuance of such rights, options or Convertible Securities shall be
readjusted to the Series Preferred Conversion Price which would have been in effect had an
adjustment been made on the basis that the only Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued
were the Additional Shares of Common Stock, if any, actually issued or sold on the exercise of
such rights or options or rights of conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, and
such Additional Shares of Common Stock, if any, were issued or sold for the consideration
actually received by the Company upon such exercise, plus the consideration, if any, actually
received by the Company for the granting of all such rights or options, whether or not exercised,
plus the consideration received for issuing or selling the Convertible Securities actually
converted or exchanged, plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the Company (other
than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities) on the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, provided that such readjustment shall not
apply to prior conversions of Series Preferred.

539109 v7/HN 12.
(v) For the purpose of making any adjustment to the
Conversion Price of the Series Preferred required under this Section 5(h), “Additional Shares of
Common Stock” shall mean all shares of Common Stock issued by the Company or deemed to
be issued pursuant to this Section 5(h) (including shares of Common Stock subsequently
reacquired or retired by the Company), other than:

(A) — shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of
the Series A Preferred or Series B Preferred;

(B) up to 1,974,500 shares (as adjusted for any stock
dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like with respect to such shares after the
filing date hereof) of Common Stock (the “Option Pool”) (as such Option Pool may be increased
from time to time by approval of the Board of Directors and the holders of at least seventy-five
percent (75%) of the outstanding shares of Series Preferred Stock as required by Section 2(b)
hereof) issued to employees, officers or directors of, or consultants or advisors to the Company
or any subsidiary, pursuant to the Plan, or any additional shares of Common Stock issued to
employees, officers or directors of, or consultants or advisors to the Company or any subsidiary,
pursuant to stock purchase or stock option plans or other arrangements that are unanimously
approved by the Board of Directors;

(C) shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to the
exercise of Convertible Securities outstanding as of the Original Issue Date;

(D) — shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities
issued for consideration other than cash pursuant to a merger, consolidation, acquisition, strategic
alliance or similar business combination approved by the Board;

(E) — shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities
issued pursuant to any equipment loan or leasing arrangement, real property leasing arrangement
or debt financing from a bank or similar financial institution approved by the Board and provided
that the issuance of such shares is primarily for purposes other than the raising of additional
capital through an equity financing;

(F) — shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities
issued by the Company pursuant to a registration statement filed under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, if upon the closing of such offering all of the outstanding shares of Series
Preferred have been converted to Common Stock either (i) at the election of the holders of such
Preferred Stock as provided in Section 5(a) hereof, or (ii) pursuant to the provisions for the
automatic conversion of such Series Preferred Stock as provided in Section 5(k) hereof;

(G) any Common Stock or Convertible Securities issued
in connection with strategic transactions involving the Company and other entities, including
{1) joint ventures, manufacturing, marketing or distribution arrangements or (ii) technology
transfer or development arrangements; provided that the issuance of shares therein has been

purposes other than the raising of additional capital through an equity financing; and

539109 v7/HN 13.
(H) for purposes of the adjustment required by Section
5(h)(i) only, any Common Stock or Convertible Securities issued in any transaction in which
exemption from the adjustment required pursuant to Section 5(h)(i) hereof is approved by the
holders of at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the outstanding Series Preferred.

References to Common Stock in the subsections of this clause (v) above shall
mean all shares of Common Stock issued by the Company or deemed to be issued pursuant to
this Section 5(h). The “Effective Price” of Additional Shares of Common Stock shall mean the
quotient determined by dividing the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock issued
or sold, or deemed to have been issued or sold by the Company under this Section 5(h), into the
Aggregate Consideration received, or deemed to have been received by the Company for such
issue under this Section 5(h), for such Additional Shares of Common Stock.

(vi) In the event that the Company issues or sells, or is deemed
to have issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock in a Qualifying Additional Issuance
(the “First Additional Issuance”), then in the event that the Company issues or sells, or is deemed
to have issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock in a Qualifying Additional Issuance
other than the First Additional Issuance pursuant to the same instruments as the First Additional
Issuance (a “Subsequent Additional Issuance”), then and in each such case upon a Subsequent
Additional Issuance the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be reduced to the
Series Preferred Conversion Price that would have been in effect had the First Additional
Issuance and each Subsequent Additional Issuance all occurred on the closing date of the First
Additional Issuance.

(i) Certificate of Adjustment. In each case of an adjustment or
readjustment of any Series Preferred Conversion Price for the number of shares of Common
Stock or other securities issuable upon conversion of any series of Series Preferred, if such Series
Preferred is then convertible pursuant to this Section 5, the Company, at its expense, shall
compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the provisions hereof and prepare a
certificate showing such adjustment or readjustment, and shall mail such certificate, by first class
mail, postage prepaid, to each registered holder of such series of Series Preferred at the holder’s
address as shown in the Company’s books. The certificate shall set forth such adjustment or
readjustment, showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based,
including a statement of (1) the consideration received or deemed to be received by the Company
for any Additional Shares of Common Stock issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or
sold, (ii) the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price at the time in effect, (iii) the number of
Additional Shares of Common Stock and (iv) the type and amount, if any, of other property
which at the time would be received upon conversion of such Series Preferred.

(j) Notices of Record Date. Upon (i) any taking by the Company of a
record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof
who are entitled to receive any dividend or other distribution, or (ii) any Acquisition (as defined
in Section 4) or other capital reorganization of the Company, any reclassification or
recapitalization of the capital stock of the Company, any merger or consolidation of the Company
with or into any other corporation, or any Asset Transfer (as defined in Section 4), or any
voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company, the Company

539109 v7/HN 14.
shall mail to each holder of Series Preferred at least ten (10) days prior to the record date
specified therein (or such shorter period approved by the holders of at least seventy-five percent
(75%) of the outstanding Series Preferred) a notice specifying (A) the date on which any such
record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend or distribution and a description of such
dividend or distribution, (B)the date on which any such Acquisition, reorganization,
reclassification, transfer, consolidation, merger, Asset Transfer, dissolution, liquidation or
winding up is expected to become effective, and (C) the date, if any, that is to be fixed as to when
the holders of record of Common Stock (or other securities) shall be entitled to exchange their
shares of Common Stock (or other securities) for securities or other property deliverable upon
such Acquisition, reorganization, reclassification, transfer, consolidation, merger, Asset Transfer,
dissolution, liquidation or winding up.

(k) Automatic Conversion.

(i) Each share of Series Preferred shail automatically be
converted into shares of Common Stock, based on the then-effective applicable Series Preferred
Conversion Price, (A) at any time upon the affirmative election of the holders of at least seventy-
five percent (75%) of the then outstanding shares of the Series Preferred, or (B) immediately
upon the closing of a firmly underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration
statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, covering the offer and sale of Common
Stock for the account of the Company in which the aggregate net cash proceeds to the Company
(after underwriting discounts, commissions and fees) are at least $20,000,000. Upon such
automatic conversion, any declared and unpaid dividends shall be paid in accordance with the
provisions of Section 5(d).

(ii) | Upon the occurrence of either of the events specified in
Section 5(k)(i) above, the outstanding shares of Series Preferred shall be converted automatically
without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates
representing such shares are surrendered to the Company or its transfer agent; provided, however,
that the Company shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common
Stock issuable upon such conversion unless the certificates evidencing such shares of Series
Preferred are either delivered to the Company or its transfer agent as provided below, or the
holder notifies the Company or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or
destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Company to indemnify the Company
from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates. Upon the occurrence of such
automatic conversion of the Series Preferred, the holders of Series Preferred shall surrender the
certificates representing such shares at the office of the Company or any transfer agent for the
Series Preferred. Thereupon, there shall be issued and delivered to such holder promptly at such
office and in its name as shown on such surrendered certificate or certificates, a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Series Preferred
surrendered were convertible on the date on which such automatic conversion occurred, and any
declared and unpaid dividends shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of Section 5(d).

(I) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall
be issued upon conversion of Series Preferred. All shares of Common Stock (including fractions
thereof) issuable upon conversion of more than one share of Series Preferred by a holder thereof

539109 v7/HN 15.
shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the conversion would result in the
issuance of any fractional share. If, after the aforementioned aggregation, the conversion would
result in the issuance of any fractional share, the Company shall, in lieu of issuing any fractional
share, pay cash equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by the Common Stock’s fair
market value (as determined by the Board) on the date of conversion.

(m) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Company
shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common
Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Series Preferred,
such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding shares of the Series Preferred. If at any time the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all then outstanding shares of the Series Preferred, the Company will take such corporate
action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.

(n) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Section 4
shall be in writing and shall be deemed effectively given: (i) upon personal delivery to the party
to be notified, (ii) when sent by confirmed electronic mail or facsimile if sent during normal
business hours of the recipient; if not, then on the next business day, (iii) five (5) days after
having been sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or (iv)
one (1) day after deposit with a nationally recognized overnight courier, specifying next day
delivery, with verification of receipt. All notices shall be addressed to each holder of record at
the address of such holder appearing on the books of the Company.

(0) Payment of Taxes. The Company will pay all taxes (other than
taxes based upon income) and other governmental charges that may be imposed with respect to
the issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of shares of Series Preferred,
excluding any tax or other charge imposed in connection with any transfer involved in the issue
and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in which the shares of Series
Preferred so converted were registered.

6. NO REISSUANCE OF SERIES PREFERRED.

No shares or shares of Series Preferred acquired by the Company by reason of
redemption, purchase, conversion or otherwise shall be reissued.

Vv.

A. The liability of the directors of the Company for monetary damages shall be
eliminated to the fullest extent under applicable law. If the Delaware General Corporation Law
(“DGCL”) is amended after approval by the stockholders of this Article V to authorize corporate
action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a
director of the Company shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the
DGCL as so amended.

539109 v7/HN 16.
B. The Company is authorized to provide indemnification of agents (as defined in
Section 317 of the CGCL and, as the case may be, other applicable) for breach of duty to the
Company and its stockholders through bylaw provisions or through agreements with the agents,
or through stockholder resolutions, or otherwise, in excess of the indemnification and
advancement otherwise permitted by Section 317 of the CGCL and Section 145 of the DGCL,
subject, at any time or times that the Company is subject to Section 2115(b) of the CGCL, to the
limits on such excess indemnification set forth in Section 204 of the CGCL.

Cc. Any repeal or modification of this Article V shall only be prospective and shall
not affect the rights under this Article V in effect at the time of the alleged occurrence of any
action or omission to act giving rise to liability.

VI.

For the management of the business and for the conduct of the affairs of the Company,
and in further definition, limitation and regulation of the powers of the Company, of its directors
and of its stockholders or any class thereof, as the case may be, it is further provided that:

A. The management of the business and the conduct of the affairs of the Company
shall be vested in its Board. The number of directors which shall constitute the whole Board
shall be fixed by the Board in the manner provided in the Bylaws, subject to any restrictions
which may be set forth in this Restated Certificate.

B. Subject to Section D.2 (b) of Article IV, the Board of Directors is expressly
empowered to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Company. The stockholders shall also
have the power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Company; provided however, that, in
addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the Company required by law
or by this Certificate of Incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of
the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Company
entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be
required to adopt, amend or repeal any provision of the Bylaws of the Company.

C. The directors of the Company need not be elected by written ballot unless the
Bylaws so provide.
