distributed to stockholders in a liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company shall be
valued as follows:

the securities shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid prices of the securities over the
10 trading day period ending 5 trading days prior to the Distribution.

€ADocuments and Settings\dominic.fanelliM.ocal Scttings\Temporary {nternct Files\OLK3\Project Arcwelder_Fitth Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation_{PAI.JB2_3490707_12).DOC -5-
(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shail be convertible, at the
option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share at the office of the
Company or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, into that number of fully-paid, nonassessable
shares of Common Stock determined by dividing the Original Issue Price for the relevant series by
the Conversion Price for such series in effect at the time of conversion. (The number of shares of
Common Stock into which each share of Preferred Stock of a series may be converted is hereinafter
referred to as the “Conversion Rate” for each such series.} Upon any decrease or increase in the
Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock, as described in this Section 3.4, the Conversion
Rate for such series shall be appropriately increased or decreased.

(b) | Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be
converted into fully-paid, nonassessable shares of Common Stock at the then effective Conversion
Rate for such share (i) immediately prior to the closing of a Qualified Public Offering or (ii) upon the
receipt by the Company of a written request for such conversion from the holders of at least 60% of
the Preferred Stock then outstanding, or, if later, the effective date for conversion specified in such
requests (each of the events referred to in (i) and (ii) are referred to herein as an “Automatic
Conversion Event’).

_(c) Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be
issued upon conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder
would otherwise be entitled, the Company shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the
then fair market value of a share of Common Stock as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors. For such purpose, all shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder of Preferred Stock
shall be aggregated, and any resulting fractional share of Common Stock shall be paid in cash.
Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into full shares of
Common Stock, and to receive certificates therefor, such holder shall surrender the certificate or
certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Company or of any transfer agent for the
Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the Company at such office that such holder elects fo
convert the same; provided, however, that on the date of an Automatic Conversion Event, the
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically, without any further action by
the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates representing such shares are

' surrendered to the Company or its transfer agent; provided further, however, that the Company shall
not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon a
conversion unless either the certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are delivered to
the Company or its transfer agent as provided above, or the holder notifies the Company or its
transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement
satisfactory to the Company to indemnity the Company from any loss incurred by it in connection
with such certificates. On the date of the occurrence of an Automatic Conversion Event, each holder
of record of shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the Common
Stock issuable upon such conversion, notwithstanding that the certificates representing such shares
of Preferred Stock shall not have been surrendered at the office of the Company, that notice from the
Company shall not have been received by any holder of record of shares of Preferred Stock, or that
the certificates evidencing such shares of Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered to such
holder. .

which shares are deemed to be issued:

(1) no further adjustment in the Conversion Price of the Preferred
Stock shall be made upon the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities or shares of Common Stock
in connection with the exercise of such Options or conversion or- exchange of such Convertible
Securities;

(2) if such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms
provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any increase in the consideration payable to the
Company, or decrease in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable, upon the exercise,
conversion or exchange thereof, the Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock computed upon the
original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and any
subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon any such increase or decrease becoming effective,
be recomputed to reflect such increase or decrease insofar as it affects such Options or the rights of
conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities; :

(3) no readjustment pursuant to clause (2) above shall have the
effect of increasing the Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock to an amount which exceeds the

CADocuments and Settings\dominic.fanclli\Local Settings\Temporary Internet Files\OLK3\Project Arcwelder_Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of
{ncorporation_(PALIB2_3490707_12).DOC -8-
Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock that would have resulted from any issuance of Additional
Shares of Common between the original adjustment date and such readjustment-date,

(4) upon the expiration of any such Options or any rights of
conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have been exercised, the
Conversion Price computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date
with respect thereto) and any subsequent adjustments based thereon shall, upon such expiration, be
recomputed as if:

a) in the case of Convertible Securities or Options for
Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common issued were the shares of Common Stock, if
any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities and the consideration received therefor was the consideration actually
received by the Company for the issue of such exercised Options plus the consideration actually
received by the Company upon such exercise or for the issue of all such Convertible Securities which
were actually converted or exchanged, plus the additional consideration, if any, actually received by
the Company upon such conversion or exchange, and

b) in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, only
the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were issued at the time of
issue of such Options, and the consideration received by the Company for the Additional Shares of
Common deemed to have been then issued was the consideration actually received by the Company
for the issue of such exercised Options, plus the consideration deemed to have been received by the
Company (determined pursuant to Section 3.4(d)(v)) upon the issue of the Convertible Securities
with respect to which such Options were actually exercised; and

(5) if such record date shall have been fixed and such Options or
Convertible Securities are not issued on the date fixed therefor, the adjustment previously made in
the Conversion Price which became effective on such record date shall be canceled as of the close of
business on such record date, and thereafter the Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this
Section 3.4(d)(iii) as of the actual date of their issuance.

In the event the Company shall issue Additional Shares of Common after the date of this Restated
Certificate of Incorporation (including Additional Shares of Common deemed to be issued pursuant
to Section 3.4(d)(iii)) without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the applicable
Conversion Price in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such issue (provided, however,
that for purposes of determining whether an adjustment is to be made, no adjustment shal! be made
to the Series A Conversion Price unless the deemed issuance is at a price below the then in effect
Series B Conversion Price), then the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock shall be
reduced, concurrently with such issue a-price (calculated to. the nearest cent) determined by
multiplying such Conversion Price fb the numerator of which shall be the number of
shares of Common Stock outstandifgimmedrately prior to such issue plus the number of shares
which the aggregate consideration recetved by the Company for the total number of Additional
Shares of Common so issued would purchase at the applicable Conversion Price (which shall be
deemed to be the Series B Conversion Price for the Series A and Series B Preferred Stock and the

C:Wocuments snd Settings\dominic.fanelli_ocal Settings\Temporary Internet Files\OLK3\Project Arcwelder_Fifih Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incarporation_(PAI.JB2_3490707_12).DOC -I- .
Series C Conversion Price for the Series C Preferred Stock), and the denominator of which shall be
the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number
of such Additional Shares of Common so issued. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Conversion
Price shall not be reduced at such time if the amount of such reduction would be less than $0.01, but
any such amount shall be carried forward, and a reduction will be made with respect to such amount
at the time of, and together with, any subsequent reduction which, together with such amount and
any other amounts so carried forward, equal $0.01 or more in the aggregate. For the purposes of this
Section 3.4(d)(iv)(1), all shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding Options or
the conversion of outstanding Convertible Securities and shares of Preferred Stock, and all
Additional Shares of Common deemed issued pursuant to Section 3.4(d)(ii1) hereof, shall be deemed
to be outstanding.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this Section 3.4(d),
the consideration received by the Company tor the issue (or deemed issue) of any Additional Shares
of Common shal! be computed as follows:

(1) Cash and Property. Such consideration shall:

aggregate amount of cash received by the Company;

b) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair market value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors; and

c) in the event Additional Shares of Common are issued
together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Company for consideration which
covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in clauses
(a) and (b) above, as reasonably determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(2) Options and Convertible Securities. |The consideration per
share received by the Company for Additional Shares of Common deemed to have been issued

(e) Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of Common Stock. In the event
the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided (by stock split, by payment of a stock
dividend or otherwise), into a greater number of shares of Common Stock without a corresponding
adjustment with respect to Preferred Stock, the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock in
effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such
subdivision, be proportionately decreased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on
conversion of any shares of Preferred Stock shall be increased in proportion to such increase in
outstanding shares. In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined (by
reclassification or otherwise) into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock without a
corresponding adjustment with respect to Preferred Stock, the Conversion Prices in effect immediately
prior to such combination shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination, be
proportionately increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of
any shares of Preferred Stock shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares.

(f) Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of Preferred Stock. \n the
event the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock or a series of Preferred Stock shall be subdivided (by
stock split, by payment of a stock dividend or otherwise), into a greater number of shares of
Preferred Stock without a corresponding adjustment with respect to Common Stock, the Dividend
Rate, Original Issue Price and Liquidation Preference of the affected series of Preferred Stock in
effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such
subdivision, be proportionately decreased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of the affected series of Preferred Stock after such subdivision shall be equal to the
number of shares of Common Stock that were issuable upon a conversion of the affected series of
Preferred Stock immediately prior to such subdivision. In the event the outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock or a series of Preferred Stock shall be combined (by reclassification or otherwise)
into a lesser number of shares of Preferred Stock without a corresponding adjustment with respect to
Common Stock, the Dividend Rate, Original Issue Price and Liquidation Preference of the affected
series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such combination shall, concurrently with the
effectiveness of such combination, be proportionately increased so that the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the affected series of Preferred Stock after such
combination shall be equal to the number of shares of Common Stock that were issuable upon a
conversion of the affected series of Preferred: Stock immediately prior to such combination.

(g) Adjustments for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. Subject to
Section 3,3 above (the “Liquidation Rights’), if the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the
Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of any other class or
classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification, merger or other transaction
(other than a subdivision or combination of shares provided for above), then, in any such event, in
lieu of the number of shares of Common Stock which the holders would otherwise have been entitled
to receive, each holder of such Preferred Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such shares
of Preferred Stock into a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock which a holder of
the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of such series of Preferred
Stock immediately before that change would have been entitled to receive in such reorganization or
reclassification, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein with respect to such other shares.
The provisions of this Section 3.4(g) shall similarly apply to successive capital reorganization,
reclassification, merger or other transaction. The Company shall not effect any such capital

Incorporation_(PALIB2_3490707_12).DOC -jj-
reorganization, reclassification, merger or other transaction unless prior to or simultaneously with the
consummation thereof the successor corporation or purchaser, as the case may be, shall assume by
written instrument the obligation to deliver to the holders of Preferred Stock such shares of stock,
securities or property as, in accordance with the foregoing provisions, each such holder is entitled to
receive in accordance with this Section 3.4(g).

(h) No Impairment. The Company will not through any reorganization, transfer of
assets, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to
avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by -
the Company but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this
Section 3.4 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect
the Conversion Rights of the holders of Preferred Stock against impairment. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Section 3.4(h) shall prohibit the Company from amending its Certificate of
Incorporation with the requisite consent of its stockholders and the Board of Directors.

(2) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 3.4, the Company at its expense shall
promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish
to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and
showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Company
shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be
furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and readjustments, (11) the
Conversion Price at the time in effect and (111) the number of shares of Common Stock and the
amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon the conversion of
Preferred Stock.

Gj) Waiver of Adjustment of Conversion Price. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, any downward adjustment of the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock
may be waived, either prospectively or retroactively and either generally or in a particular instance,
by the consent or vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of such series.
Any such waiver shall bind all future holders of shares of such series of Preferred Stock.

(k) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Company shall at all
times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock solely
for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock, such number of its
shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then
outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding
shares of the Preferred Stock, the Company will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of
its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such
number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.

limiting the foregoing renunciation, the Company acknowledges that the Preferred Investor Parties
are in the business of making investments in, and have investments in, other businesses similar to

particular investment opportunity. The provisions of this Article X shall in no way limit or eliminate
