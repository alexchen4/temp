prior and in preference to any declaration or payment of any dividend (payable other than in

Ahien - Eleventh Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (FINAL)_(PALIB2_5303574_4) -2-
Common Stock or other securities and rights convertible into or entitling the holder thereof to
receive, directly or indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock of the Company) on the Common
Stock of the Company, at the rate of 8% of the respective Purchase Price (as defined below) per
share of Preferred Stock per annum. Such dividends shall not be cumulative, and no right to such
dividends shall accrue to holders of the Preferred Stock unless declared by the Board of Directors.
Payment of any dividends to the holders of the Preferred Stock shall be on a pro rata, pari passu
basis in proportion to the dividend amount for each series of Preferred Stock. No dividends or other
distributions shall be made with respect to the Common Stock, other than dividends payable solely
in Common Stock, unless the holders of the Preferred Stock shall first receive, or simultaneously
receive, their full preference as provided for in the first sentence of this Section 1 (a).

(b) Additional Dividends. After the payment or setting aside for payment of the
dividends described in Section !{a), any additional dividends (other than dividends on Common
Stock payable solely in Common Stock) set aside or paid in any fiscal year shall be set aside or paid
among the holders of the Preferred Stock and Common Stock then outstanding in proportion to the
greatest whole number of shares of Common Stock which would be held by each such holder if all
shares of Preferred Stock were converted at the then-effective Conversion Rate (as defined in
Section 4).

2. Liquidation Preference.

(a) Preferences. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Company (“Liquidation”), either voluntary or involuntary, distributions to the stockholders of the
Company shall be made in the following manner:

(i) First, the holders of the Series B’ Preferred and Series B” Preferred
shall be entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any distribution of any of the assets or surplus
funds of the Company to the holders of other classes of Preferred Stock or Common Stock by reason
of their ownership of such stock, a dollar amount equal to the greater of (1) the Series B’ Purchase
Price or Series B” Purchase Price, as the case may be, for each share of Series B’ Preferred or Series
B” Preferred then held by them, plus an amount equal to all declared but unpaid dividends on such
share of Series B’ Preferred or Series B” Preferred or (ii) the amount that would have been payable
for such shares of Series B’ Preferred and Series B” Preferred if such Series B’ Preferred and Series
B” Preferred had been converted to shares of Common Stock immediately prior to such event. If the
assets and funds thus distributable among the holders of the Series B’ Preferred and Series B”
Preferred shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full aforesaid preferential
amount, then the entire remaining assets and funds of the Company legally available for distribution
shall be distributed among the holders of the Series B’ Preferred and Series B” Preferred in
proportion to the full preferential amount each such holder is otherwise entitled to receive pursuant
to this Section 2(a)(1).

(ii) | Second, the holders of the Series A’ Preferred and Series A” Preferred
shall be entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any distribution of any of the assets or surplus
funds of the Company to the holders of Common Stock by reason of their ownership of such stock, a
dollar amount equal to the greater of (i) the product of the Series A’ Purchase Price or Series A”
Purchase Price, as the case may be, multiplied by 1.5 for cach share of Series A’ Preferred or Series

Alien - Eleventh Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (FENAI,) (PALIB2_5303574 4) -3-
A” Preferred then held by them, plus an amount equal to all declared but unpaid dividends on such
share of Series A’ Preferred or Series A” Preferred or (ii) the amount that would have been payable
for such shares of Series A’ Preferred and Series A” Preferred if such Series A’ Preferred and Series
A” Preferred had been converted to shares of Common Stock immediately prior to such event. If the
assets and funds thus distributable among the holders of the Series A’ Preferred and Series A”
Preferred shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full aforesaid preferential
amount, then the entire remaining assets and funds of the Company legally available for distribution
shall be distributed among the holders of the Series A’ Preferred and Series A” Preferred in
proportion to the full preferential amount each such holder is otherwise entitled to receive pursuant
to this Section 2(a)(ii).

(iii) Thereafter, any remaining asscts and funds legally available for
distribution hereunder shall be distributed among the holders of Common Stock, Series A’ Preferred
and Series A” Preferred based upon the number of shares of Common Stock held or issuable upon
conversion of shares of Series A’ Preferred and Series A” Preferred held by each such holder.

(b) Mergers, Consolidations, Sales, etc. For purposes of this Section 2, a merger or
consolidation of the Company with or into any other corporation or corporations (but excluding any
merger effected solely for the purpose of reincorporating in another state), or the merger of any
other corporation or corporations into the Company, in which consolidation or merger the
stockholders of the Company receive distributions in cash or securities of another corporation or
corporations as a result of such consolidation or merger and in which the stockholders of the
Company, immediately prior to such merger or consolidation, hold, immediately after such merger
or consolidation, less than a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the surviving or
successor entity or its parent, or a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company (each,
a “Corporate Sale”), shall be treated as a Liquidation unless otherwise agreed in writing by the
holders of at least a majority of the collective voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Company shall take such actions as are
necessary to give effect to the provisions of this Section 2(b), including without limitation, (i) in the
case of a merger or consolidation, causing the definitive agreement relating to such merger or
consolidation to provide for a rate at which the shares of Preferred Stock are converted into or
exchanged for cash, new securities or other property that gives effect to the preferences and
priorities set forth in Section 2(a) above or (ii) in the case of an asset sale, redeeming the Preferred
Stock. The Company shall promptly provide to the holders of shares of Preferred Stock such
information concerning the terms of such merger, consolidation or sale as may reasonably be
requested by the holders of Preferred Stock. The amount deemed distributed to the holders of
Preferred Stock upon any such transaction shall be the sum of any cash and the value of any
property, rights or securities distributed to such holders by the Company or the acquiring person,
firm or other entity, as applicable.

{c) Valuation. Any securitics to be delivered pursuant to Section 2(b) above shall

shall be the fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Company and holders of

Company’s Board of Directors. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert
the same into full shares of Common Stock and to receive certificates therefor, such holder shall
surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Company or of
any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the Company at such
office that such holder elects to convert the same; provided, however, that in the event of a
conversion pursuant to Section 4(b), all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock to be converted shall
be converted automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or
not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Company or its transfer agent;
and provided further, that the Company shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the
shares of Common Stock issuable upon any conversion unless the certificates evidencing such
shares of Preferred Stock are either delivered to the Company or its transfer agent as provided
above, or the holder notifies the Company or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost,
stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement and, if requested, provide security, satisfactory to the
Company to indemnify the Company for losses incurred as a result of the loss of such certificates.
The Company shall, as soon as practicable after such delivery, or such agreement, indemnification
and security in the case of a lost certificate, issue and deliver to such holder of Preferred Stock a
certificate or certificates for the shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as
aforesaid and a check payable to the holder in the amount of any cash amounts payable with respect
to fractional shares. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the
close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, or,
in the case of automatic conversion, on the date of closing of such initial public offering or
Corporate Sale or the effective date of such written consent, as the case may be, and the person or
persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be
treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such
date.

(d) Adjustments to Conversion Price for Diluting Issues.

(i) Special Definitions. For purposes of this Section, the following
definitions shall apply:

(A) “Options” shall mean rights, options or warrants to subscribe
for, purchase or otherwise acquire either Common Stock or Convertible Securities. To the extent

Alien - Eleventh Amended and Restated Certificate of incorporation (FINAL) (PALIB2_5303574_4) -7-
that such rights, options or warrants when issued are not then exercisable, or the number of shares
for which they are exercisable is not determinable, they shall not be considered Options until such
time, if ever, they become exercisable or the number of shares for which they are exercisable
becomes determinable, in either case whether by their terms or otherwise.

(B) “Convertible Securities” shall mean any securities of the
Company (other than Common Stock) currently convertible into or exchangeable, directly or
indirectly, for Common Stock. To the extent that securities when issued are not then convertible or
exchangeable, or the number of shares into which they are convertible or exchangeable for is not
determinable, they shall not be considered Convertible Securities until such time, if ever, they
become convertible or exchangeable or the number of shares for which they are convertible or
exercisable becomes determinable, in either case whether by their terms or otherwise.

(C) “Additional Shares of Common Stock” shall mean all shares
of Common Stock issued (which shall include issuances or deemed issuances, pursuant to Section
4(d)(iii), of Options or Convertible Securities) by the Company on or after the Filing Date; provided,
however, that “Additional Shares of Common Stock” shall not mean shares of Common Stock
issued, issuable or, pursuant to Section 4(d)(iii), deemed to be issued:

(1) upon conversion of the Preferred Stock authorized
herein or upon conversion of Convertible Securities outstanding on the Filing Date;

(2) to officers, directors or employees of, or consultants to,
the Company pursuant to a stock grant, option plan or purchase plan or other stock incentive
program, arrangement or agreement approved by the Board of Directors;

(3) as a dividend or distribution on Preferred Stock;

(4) in connection with placement agent services;

(5) in connection with lease or loan transactions, including
equipment leases, approved by a majority of the Company’s Board of Directors (provided that such

lease and loan transactions are not primarily equity financing transactions);

(6) in connection with business combinations, including
combinations by merger or asset purchase or other reorganization, or corporate partnering
arrangements, approved by a majority of the Company’s Board of Directors;

(7) in connection with a firm commitment public offering
pursuant to a registration statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission;

(8) as a result of the issuance of shares of Series B’

Preferred issued pursuant to the transactions contemplated within the Series B’ Preferred Stock and
Warrant Purchase Agreement, as may be amended (the “Series B’ Purchase Agreement”);

Alien - Eleventh Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (FINAL) _(PALIB2_5303574_4) -8-
(9) as a result of the issuance of the warrants issued
pursuant to the Series B’ Purchase Agreement or that certain Placement Agent Agreement dated
January 10, 2011 or the underlying shares issued upon exercise of such warrants;

(10)  asaresult of the issuance of the warrants issued in
exchange for Convertible Securities outstanding on the Filing Date, or the underlying shares issued

upon exercise of such warrants;

(11) in settlement of any obligations owed to Renaissance
Development, LLC or of any disputes relating thereto; and

(12) in connection with any transaction for which
adjustment is made pursuant to Sections 4(d){iv), (v) or (vi) hereof.

(ii) Adjustment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional Shares

of Common Stock.

(A) Preferred Stock. In the event the Company shall issue after the
Filing Date Additional Shares of Common Stock without consideration or for a consideration per
share less than the applicable Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock in effect on the date of
and immediately prior to such issue, then, the Conversion Price of the affected series of Preferred
Stock shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest cent)
determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance (treating for this
purpose as outstanding all shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Options outstanding
immediately prior to such issuance or upon conversion or exchange of Convertible Securities
outstanding (assuming exercise of any outstanding Options therefor) immediately prior to such
issuance) plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration received
by the Company for the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued would
purchase at such Conversion Price, and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance (again treating for this purpose as
outstanding all shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Options outstanding immediately
prior to such issuance or upon conversion or exchange of Convertible Securities outstanding
(assuming exercise of any outstanding Options therefor) immediately prior to such issuance) plus the
number of such Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued.

(B) For the purposes of this Section 4(d)(ii), the grant, issue or sale
of all Additional Shares of Common Stock of the same class or series of security issued or issuable
at the same price, plus any warrants to purchase such security issued or issuable in connection
therewith, at more than one closing (each, a “Subsequent Closing”) shall be aggregated and shall be
treated as one sale of Additional Shares of Common Stock occurring on the earliest date on which
such securities were granted, issued or sold; provided that the applicable Conversion Price of any
Preferred Stock that is converted prior to a Subsequent Closing shall not reflect the Additional
Shares of Common Stock issued or issuable in such Subsequent Closing when determining the
applicable Conversion Price with respect to such conversion.

Alien - Eleventh Amended and Restated Certificate of [Incorporation (FINAL) (PA].1B2_5303574_4) -9-
(iii) | Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this Section 4(d), the
consideration received by the Company for the issuance of any Additional Shares of Common Stock
and the number of such Additional Shares of Common Stock shall be computed as follows:

(A) Cash and Property. Such consideration shall:

(1) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed as the
aggregate amount of cash received by the Company without any deduction for commissions;

(2) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair value thereof at the time of such issuance, as determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors; and

(3) in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock are
issued together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Company for consideration
which covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received for the Additional Shares of
Common Stock alone, computed as provided in clauses (1) and (2) above, as determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors.

(B) Options and Convertible Securities. In the case of issuance of

Options or Convertible Securities, the following provisions shall apply for all purposes of Section
4(d):

(1) The aggregate maximum number of shares of Common
Stock deliverable upon exercise of Options shall be deemed to be Additional Shares of Common
Stock issued at the time such Options were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration
(determined in the manner provided in subparagraph 4(d)(iii)(A)), if any, received by the Company
upon the issuance of such Options plus the exercise price provided in such Options for the Common
Stock covered thereby.

(2) The aggregate maximum number of shares of Common
Stock deliverable upon conversion of or in exchange for such Convertible Securities or upon the
exercise of Options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Convertible Securities and subsequent
conversion or exchange thereof shall be deemed to be Additional Shares of Common Stock issued at
the time such securities were issued or such Options were issued and for a consideration equal to the
consideration, if any, received by the Company for any such Convertible Securities and related
Options plus the additional consideration, if any, to be received by the Company upon the
conversion or exchange of such securities or the exercise of any related Options (the consideration in
each case to be determined in the manner provided in subparagraph 4(d)(ii1)(A)).

(3) In the event of any change in the number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to this Company upon exercise of such
Options or upon conversion of or in exchange for such Convertible Securities, including, but not
limited to, a change resulting from the antidilution provisions thereof, the Conversion Price of each
series of Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such Options or
Convertible Securities, shall be recomputed to reflect such change, but no further adjustment shall be

Alien - Eleventh Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (FINAL) (PALIB2_5303574_4) -10-
made for the actual issuance of Common Stock or any payment of such consideration upon the
exercise of any such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities.

(4) Upon the expiration of any such Options, the
termination of any such rights to convert or exchange, or the expiration of any Options or rights
related to, such Convertible Securities, the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock to the
extent in any way affected by or computed using such Options or Convertible Securities, shall be
recomputed to reflect the issuance of only the number of shares of Common Stock (and Convertible
Securities which remain in effect) actually issued upon the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities or upon the exercise of the Options related to such securities.

(5) The number of shares of Common Stock deemed issued
and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to subparagraphs 4(d)(iii)(B)(1) and (2) shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or expiration of the type described in either
subparagraph 4(d)(iii)(B)(3) or (4).

(iv) Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of or Stock Dividends
on Common Stock. In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided (by

stock split or otherwise) into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, or the Company at any
time or from time to time after the Filing Date shall declare or pay any dividend on the Common
Stock payable in Common Stock, the Conversion Rate of each series of Preferred Stock then in
effect shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such subdivision or stock dividend, be
proportionately increased based on the ratio of (A) the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately after such subdivision or stock dividend to (B) the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such subdivision or stock dividend. In the event
the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined or consolidated, by reclassification or
otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock after the Filing Date, the Conversion
Rate of each series of Preferred Stock then in effect shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such
combination or consolidation, be proportionately decreased on the same basis.

(v) Adjustments for Other Distributions. In the event the Company at any
time or from time to time after the Filing Date makes, or fixes a record date for the determination of
holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, any distribution payable in (A) securities of the
Company or other entities (other than shares of Common Stock and other than as otherwise adjusted
in this Section 4 or as otherwise provided in Section 1), (B) evidences of indebtedness issued by the
Company or other persons, or (C) assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred
to in subparagraph 4(e)(iii){B), then and in each such event provision shall be made so that the
holders of Preferred Stock shall receive upon conversion thereof, in addition to the number of shares
of Common Stock receivable thereupon, the amount of such distribution that they would have
received had their Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event and
had they thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to and including the date of
conversion, retained such securities receivable by them as aforesaid during such period, subject to all
other adjustments called for during such period under this Section 4 with respect to the rights of the
holders of Preferred Stock.

(vi) Adjustments for Recapitalization, Reclassification, Exchange and
Substitution. If at any time or from time to time after the Filing Date the Common Stock issuable

upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or a different number of
shares of any other class or classes of stock, whether by recapitalization, capital reorganization,
reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision, combination of shares or merger or sale of
assets transaction provided for above or in Section 2(b)), the Conversion Rate of each series of
Preferred Stock then in effect shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such recapitalization,
reorganization or reclassification, be proportionately adjusted such that the Preferred Stock shall be
convertible into, in lieu of the number of shares of Common Stock that the holders thereof would

equivalent to the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been subject to receipt by the
holders upon conversion of the Preferred Stock immediately before that change. In addition, to the
extent applicable in any reorganization or recapitalization, provision shall be made so that the
holders of Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of the Preferred

reorganization or recapitalization.

outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then-outstanding
shares of the Preferred Stock, in addition to such other remedies as shall be available to the holder

counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such
