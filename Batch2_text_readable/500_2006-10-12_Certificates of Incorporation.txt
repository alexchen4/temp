2. Conversion. The holders of Series A Preferred shall have ‘conversion
rights as follows:

(a) Right to Convert; Conversion Price. Each share of Series A
Preferred shall be convertible, without the payment of any additional consideration by the holder

share, at the office of the Corporation, into such number of fully paid and non-assessable shares
of Common Stock as is determined by dividing (1) the Applicable Base Liquidation Price by (2)
the Applicable Conversion Price, determined as hereinafter provided, in effect at the time of
conversion. The Applicable Conversion Price for purposes of calculating the number of shares
of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion shall initially be equal to $1.00. Such initial
Applicable Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment, in order to adjust the number of
shares of Common Stock into which the Series A Preferred is convertible, as hereinafter
provided.

(b) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Series A Preferred
shall be entitled to convert the same into full shares of Common Stock, such holder shall
surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation
and shall give written notice to the Corporation at such office that such holder elects to convert
the same and shal] state therein the name of such holder or the name or names of the nominees of
such holder in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common
Stock to be issued. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of
any shares of Series A Preferred. In lieu of any fractional shares of Common Stock to which the
holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall! pay cash equal to such fraction
multiplied by the then effective Applicable Conversion Price. The Corporation shall, as soon as
practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Series A Preferred, or to
such holder’s nominee or nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of
Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid, together with cash in lieu of
any fraction of a share. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior
to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Series A Preferred to be
converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable
upon conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of
Common Stock on such date.

(c) Automatic Conversion.

(i) Each share of Series A Preferred shall automatically be
converted into such number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of
Common Stock as determined by dividing (1) the Applicable Base
Liquidation Price by (2) the Applicable Conversion Price in effect at the
time of conversion upon the earlier to occur of the following:

(A) Immediately prior to the closing of a firm
commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective
registration statement under the Act, covering the offer and sale of
Common Stock at an initial public offering price per share (prior to
underwriter commissions and expenses) of not less than $4.00 (subject to
equitable adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split,
combination, reorganization, recapitalization or similar event involving a
change in the Common Stock) with aggregate gross proceeds to the
Corporation of not less than $40,000,000 (a “Qualified Public Offering”);

or

(B) The affirmative vote thereof or consent of the
holders of at least fifty-five percent (55%) of the Series A Preferred,
voting together as a separate class.
(ii) | Upon the occurrence of an event specified in Section 2(c)
(i) hereof, all shares of Series A Preferred shall be converted automatically
without any further action by any holder of such shares and whether or not
the certificate or certificates representing such shares are surrendered to
the Corporation; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be
obligated to issue a certificate or certificates evidencing the shares of
Common Stock into which such shares of Series A Preferred were
convertible unless the certificate or certificates representing such shares of
Series A Preferred being converted are either delivered to the Corporation,
or the holder notifies the Corporation that such certificate or certificates
have been lost, stolen, or destroyed and executes and delivers an
agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation
from any loss incurred by it in connection therewith and, if the
Corporation so elects, provides an appropriate indemnity.

(iii) | Upon the occurrence of an event specified in Section 2(c)(i)
hereof, each holder of Series A Preferred shall surrender the certificate or
certificates representing such holder’s shares of Series A Preferred at the
office of the Corporation. Thereupon, there shall be issued and delivered
to such holder, promptly at such office and in such holder’s name as
shown on such surrendered certificate or certificates, a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which the
shares of Series A Preferred surrendered were convertible on the date on
which such automatic conversion occurred. No fractional shares of
Common Stock shall be issued upon the automatic conversion of Series A
Preferred. In lieu of any fractional shares of Common Stock to which the
holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to
such fraction multiplied by the then effective Applicable Conversion
Price.

thereof, upon surrender of their certificate or certificates therefor, to receive certificates for the
number of shares of Series A Preferred into which such Series A Preferred has been converted,
and payment of any declared but unpaid dividends thereon. If so required by the Corporation,
certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by written instrument
or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the
registered holder or by his, her or its attorney duly authorized in writing. As soon as practicable
after the Special Mandatory Conversion and the surrender of the certificate or certificates for
Series A Preferred so converted, the Corporation shall cause to be issued and delivered to such
holder, or on his, her or its written order, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable on such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof.

14
(iii) | Each holder of Series A Preferred that purchases at least one
hundred (100%) percent of its Pro Rata Amount, shall receive, in addition to the Offered
Securities (as defined below) so purchased, a Bonus Warrant (as defined below) to purchase an
amount of such Offered Securities as is equal to the quotient of (i) an amount equal to twenty
(20%) percent of the aggregate purchase price for the Offered Securities purchased by such
holder, divided by (ii) the purchase price per security of such Offered Securities.

(iv) All certificates evidencing shares of Series A Preferred which are
required to be surrendered for conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof shall, from
and after the time of the Special Mandatory Conversion, be deemed to have been retired and
cancelled, and the shares of Series A Preferred converted pursuant to Section 2(e)(i) represented
thereby shall, from and after the time of the Special Mandatory Conversion, be deemed to have
been converted into Series A Preferred for all purposes, notwithstanding the failure of the holder
or holders thereof to surrender such certificates on or prior to such date. The Corporation may
thereafter take such appropriate action (without the need for stockholder action) as may be
necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Series A Preferred accordingly.

(v) Special Definitions. For purposes of this Section 2(e), the
following definitions shall apply:

(A) “Affiliate” shall mean, with respect
to any holder of shares of Series A Preferred, any person, entity or firm
which, directly or indirectly, controls, is controlled by or is under common
control with such holder, including, without limitation, any entity of which
the holder is a partner or member, any partner, officer, director, member or
employee of such holder and any venture capital fund now or hereafter
existing of which the holder is a partner or member which is controlled by
or under common contro] with one or more general partners of such holder
or shares the same management company with such holder.

(B) “Bonus Warrants” shall mean
warrants exercisable for a period of ten (10) years from the date of
issuance thereof, which include the right to make a “cashless” exercise for
equity securities of the Corporation having the same rights, preferences
and price per security as the Offered Securities, substantially in the form
of Exhibit H to the Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement.

(C) “Pro Rata Amount” shall mean, with
respect to any holder of Series A Preferred, the number of Offered
Securities calculated by multiplying the aggregate number of Offered
Securities by a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the number of
shares of Series A Preferred owned by such holder immediately pnor to
the applicable Qualified Financing, and the denominator of which is equal
to the aggregate number of shares of Series A Preferred owned by all
holders of outstanding shares of Series A Preferred immediately prior to
the applicable Qualified Financing.

15
(D) “Qualified Financing” shall mean (i)
any issuance or sale of Series A Preferred pursuant to the Preferred Stock
Purchase Agreement or (ii) any equity financing, or portion thereof,
intended as a substitute or replacement of any Series A Preferred financing
or portion thereof.

(fp No Impairment. The Corporation will not through any
reorganization, transfer of assets, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other
voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be
observed or performed hereunder by the Corporation but will at all times in good faith assist in
the carrying out of all the provisions of this Section 2 and in the taking of all such action as may
be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holders of Series A
Preferred against impairment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 2(f) shall
prohibit the Corporation from amending its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
with the requisite consent of its stockholders and the Board of Directors.

(g) Certificate _as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each
adjustment or readjustment of the Applicable Conversion Price or Applicable Base Liquidation
Price pursuant to this Section 2, the Corporation shall promptly compute such adjustment or
readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to each affected holder of Series A
Preferred, a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the
facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon the
written request at any time of any affected holder of Series A Preferred, furnish to such holder a
certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments or readjustments and facts, (ii) the Applicable
Conversion Price or Applicable Base Liquidation Price at the time in effect, and (iii) the number
of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be
received upon conversion of each share of Series A Preferred.

(h) Notices of Record Date. In the event of any taking by the
Corporation of a record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining
the holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend which is
the same as cash dividends paid in previous quarters) or other distribution, the Corporation shall
mail to each holder of Series A Preferred at least ten (10) days prior to such record date a notice

specifying the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend or
distribution.
3. Voting Rights.
(a) Generally. Except as otherwise required by law or this Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and in addition to the rights provided by the
Corporation’s By-Laws, the holders of Series A Preferred and the holders of Common Stock

shall be entitled to notice of any stockholders’ meeting and to vote as a single class upon any
matter submitted to the stockholders for a vote, on the following basis:

(i) Holders of Common Stock shall have one vote per share of
Common Stock held by them; and

16
(ii) | Each holder of shares of Series A Preferred shall be entitled
to the number of votes equal to the number of shares of Common Stock
into which such holder’s shares of Series A Preferred could be converted
on the date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the
meeting, rounded to the nearest one-tenth of a share.

(b) Board Size. The Corporation shall not, without the affirmative
vote or written consent of the holders of a majority in voting power of the Series A Preferred,
voting separately as a class, increase the maximum number of directors constituting the
Corporation’s Board of Directors to a number in excess of four (4).

(c) Series A Directors. So long as any shares of Series A Preferred
remain outstanding, in addition to voting as a single class with the holders of Common Stock, the
holders of the Series A Preferred voting separately as a class, shall at all times be entitled to elect
two (2) members of the Board (the “Series A Directors”).

(d) Written Consents. Matters that are required by this Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation to be approved by a vote of holders of any series or class of
capital stock may be approved at a meeting or by written consent in accordance with the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

4. Dividend Rights.

- (a) From and after the Original Issue Date, dividends shall accrue on a
daily basis on each share of the Series A Preferred at the rate per annum equal to eight percent
(8%) (the “Preferred Dividends”) of the original purchase price of the Series A Preferred. The
Preferred Dividends shall be cumulative from the Original Issue Date and shall be paid when, as
and if declared by the Board, upon a Liquidity Event, Sale Event, upon Redemption or as
otherwise set forth in this Amended and Restated Certificate. Except as permitted under Section
6(d), any accumulation of dividends on the Series A Preferred shall not bear interest. Cumulative
dividends with respect to a share of Series A Preferred which are accrued, payable and/or in
arrears shall, upon conversion of such share to Common Stock, not then or thereafter be paid and
shall cease to be accrued, payable and/or in arrears. Any partial payment shall be made ratably
among the holders of the Series A Preferred in proportion to the payment each such holder would
receive if the full amount of such dividends were paid.

(b) No dividend shall be paid on any shares of Common Stock unless
all accrued and unpaid dividends for the Series A Preferred have first been paid. If the Board of
Directors shall declare a dividend payable upon the then outstanding shares of the Common
Stock (other than a dividend payable entirely in shares of the Common Stock of the
Corporation), then the Board shall declare at the same time a dividend upon the then outstanding
shares of Series A Preferred payable at the same time as the dividend paid on the Common
Stock, in an amount equal to the amount of dividends per share of Series A Preferred as would
have been payable on the shares of Common Stock which each share of Series A Preferred held
by each holder thereof would have received if such Series A Preferred had been converted to
Common Stock pursuant to the provision of Section 2 hereof as of the record date for the
determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such dividends.

17

5. Protective Provisions. The Corporation shall not, without first having
obtained the affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of at least fifty-five percent (55%)
of the voting power of the Series A Preferred:

Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any filing of a Certificate of Designation),

(b) Authorize or designate (whether by reclassification or otherwise)
or issue any new class or series of capital stock of the Corporation or any obligations or

preferences superior to or on a parity with the Series A Preferred (including, without limitation,
Excluded Securities), or effect an increase in the authorized or designated number of any such
new class or series;

(c) Amend, alter or change the rights, preferences and privileges of the
Series A Preferred, whether through amendment, merger, consolidation or otherwise;

other action which results in a Liquidity Event or Sale Event or consummate any merger or
consolidation of the Corporation with or into any other corporation or entity;

(f) Increase or decrease the authorized number of directors comprising
the Board;

(g) Alter the mechanisms or procedures for designating or electing
members of the Board;

(h) Redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire, or set aside any sums for
the redemption, repurchase or other acquisition of, any capital stock or options to purchase
capital stock of the Corporation, or any obligations or securities convertible into shares of capital
stock (other than the redemption of the Series A Preferred described herein and the repurchase of
shares of stock from employees, consultants and advisors pursuant to agreements which permit
the Corporation to repurchase such shares at cost or fair market value, as such agreement may
provide therein, upon termination of services to the Corporation or in exercise of the
Corporation’s right of first refusal upon a proposed transfer);

(i) Declare or pay a dividend or other distribution on the Common
Stock or on any other class or series of capital stock (other than the Series A Preferred), or any
other action that results in a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock or on any other
class or series of capital stock (other than the Series A Preferred);

18
(j) Purchase, lease, license or otherwise acquire for value, or agree or
commit to purchase, lease, license or otherwise acquire for value, (i) any material ownership
interest, or right to acquire a material ownership interest, in another corporation, partnership,
limited liability company or other entity or (ii) all or substantially of the assets of any (A) such
other corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other entity or (B) any line of
business, division or material portion of any such other corporation, partnership, limited liability
company;

(k) | Undertake any underwritten initial public offering other than a
Qualified Public Offering;

(1) Change the primary line of business of the Corporation; or

(m) Pledge, hypothecate or create any lien, security interest in or
encumbrance on (1) assets of the Corporation in the aggregate in excess of $250,000 or (2) any
of the Corporation’s intellectual property, excluding, in each case agreements or arrangements
unanimously approved by the Board of Directors for (x) bank or other financial institution
borrowing and (y) licenses or similar agreements entered into in the course of carrying out the
Corporation’s business plan.

6. Redemption.
(a)

(i) Redemption After Five Years. At the request of the holder
or holders of at least fifty-five percent (55%) of the voting power of the
Series A Preferred, voting as a separate class (individually, a “Requesting
Holder’ and, collectively, the “Requesting Holders”), received by the
Corporation at any time after the fifth anniversary of the Original Issue
Date but prior to a Qualified Public Offering, such request to be made in
writing and delivered to the Corporation in accordance with the provisions
of Section 6(c) hereof (the “Redemption Notice”), the Corporation shall
redeem on the date that is sixty (60) days following the date of the
Redemption Notice (the “Initial Redemption Date”) and on each of the
first and second anniversaries of the Initial Redemption Date (together
with the Initial Redemption Date, each a “Five Year Redemption Date”),
unless otherwise prevented by law, thirty-three and one-third percent (33
1/3%) of the then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred held by such
Requesting Holders and any other holders of Series A Preferred who wish
to be redeemed concurrently with such Requesting Holders, at a
redemption price equal to the original purchase price of the Series A
Preferred per share of such Series A Preferred (which amount shall be
subject to equitable adjustment whenever there shall have occurred a stock
split, stock combination, stock dividend or other similar event with respect
to the Series A Preferred), plus an amount equal to any accrued or
declared but unpaid dividends thereon (the “Redemption Price”).

19
(ii) Redemption Date. The Initial Redemption Date and each
Five Year Redemption Date is a “Redemption Date.”

(b) Ifthe Redemption Notice shall have been duly given, and if on the
applicable Redemption Date the Redemption Price payable upon redemption of the shares of
Series A Preferred to be redeemed on such Redemption Date is paid or tendered for payment or
deposited with an independent payment agent so as to be available therefor, then notwithstanding
that the certificates evidencing any of the shares of Series A Preferred so called for redemption
shall not have been surrendered, dividends with respect to such shares of Series A Preferred shail
cease to accrue after such Redemption Date and all rights with respect to such shares shall
forthwith after the Redemption Date terminate, except only the right of the holders to receive the
Redemption Price without interest upon surrender of their certificate or certificates therefor.

(c) | Any Redemption Notice shall be sent pursuant to this Section 6 by
first-class, certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, to the Corporation at its
principal place of business or to any transfer agent of the Corporation and shall be deemed
received on the 5" business day (or if sent overseas, on the 10" business day) following the day
such mailing is made. Within fifteen (15) business days of receipt of a Redemption Notice, the
Corporation shall notify in writing all other holders of Series A Preferred of the request by a
Requesting Holder for the redemption of Series A Preferred (the “Corporation Notice”) and the
date of first Redemption Date. On each Redemption Date, the Corporation shall pay each holder
of Series A Preferred the applicable Redemption Price pursuant to the terms of Section 6(a),
provided that the Corporation has received the certificates representing the shares of Series A
Preferred to be redeemed. If, on any Redemption Date, less than all the shares of Series A
Preferred to be redeemed on such Redemption Date may be legally redeemed by the
Corporation, the number of shares of Series A Preferred legally permitted to be redeemed shall
be allocated pro rata among the holders of Series A Preferred, and any shares of Series A
Preferred intended to but not redeemed on such Redemption Date shall be redeemed, at the
holder’s election, on any date following such Redemption Date on which the Corporation may
lawfully redeem such shares in which case the shares of Series A Preferred not redeemed on such
Redemption Date shall continue to be outstanding and entitle such holder to all nights, powers
and privileges of a holder of such shares. The Corporation shall redeem (unless otherwise
prevented by law) the shares of Series A Preferred being redeemed on the applicable Redemption
Date and the Corporation shall promptly advise each holder of Series A Preferred of such
Redemption Date or of the relevant facts applicable thereto preventing such redemption. Upon
redemption of only a portion of the number of shares covered by a Series A Preferred certificate,
the Corporation shall issue and deliver to or upon the written order of the holder of such Series A
Preferred certificate, at the expense of the Corporation, a new certificate covering the number of
shares of the Series A Preferred representing the unredeemed portion of the Series A Preferred
certificate, which new certificate shall entitle the holder thereof to all the rights, powers and
privileges of a holder of such shares.

(d) In the event that the Corporation fails to pay the applicable
Redemption Price on the applicable Redemption Date pursuant to the terms of Section 6(a),
interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum shall accrue on the unpaid balance,
payable quarterly in arrears.

20
7. No Reissuance of Series A Preferred. No share or shares of Series A
Preferred acquired by the Corporation by reason of redemption, purchase, conversion or
otherwise shall be reissued, and all such shares shall be canceled, retired and eliminated from the
shares which the Corporation shall be authorized to issue. This Amended and Restated

_ Certificate of the Corporation shall be appropriately amended to effect the corresponding
reduction in this Corporation’s authorized capital stock.

8. Residual Rights. All rights accruing to the outstanding shares of the
Corporation not expressly provided for in the terms of the Series A Preferred shall be vested in
the Common Stock.

9. Stock to be Reserved. The Corporation will at all times reserve and keep
available out of its authorized Common Stock, solely for the purpose of issuance upon the
conversion of Series A Preferred as herein provided, such number of shares of Common Stock as
shall then be issuable upon the conversion of all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred. The
Corporation covenants that all shares of Common Stock which shall be so issued shall be duly
and validly issued and fully paid and nonassessable and free from all taxes, liens and charges
with respect to the issue thereof, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Corporation covenants that it will from time to time take all such action as may be required to
assure that the par value per share of the Common Stock is at all times equal to or less than the
Applicable Conversion Price in effect at the time. The Corporation will take all such action as
may be necessary to assure that all such shares of Common Stock may be so issued without
violation of any applicable law or regulation, or of any requirement of any national securities
exchange upon which the Common Stock may be listed. The Corporation will not take any
action which results in any adjustment of the Applicable Conversion Price if the total number of
shares of Common Stock issued and issuable after such action upon conversion of the Series A
Preferred would exceed the total number of shares of Common Stock then authorized by the
Corporation’s certificate of incorporation.

FIFTH: The Corporation is to have perpetual existence.

SIXTH: For the management of the business and the conduct of the affairs
of the Corporation, and in further definition and not in limitation of the powers of the
Corporation and of its directors and of its stockholders or any class thereof, as the case may be,
by the State of Delaware, it is further provided that:

A. The management of the business and the conduct of the affairs of the
Corporation shall be vested in its Board. In addition to the powers and authority expressly
conferred upon them by statute or by this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or
the By-Laws of the Corporation as in effect from time to time, the directors are hereby
empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or
done by the Corporation. Subject to the provisions of this Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation and the Stockholders’ Agreement among the Corporation and the Stockholders (as
defined therein) dated as of even date herewith, as may be amended from time to time, the
number of directors which shall constitute the whole Board of Directors shall be fixed by, or in
the manner provided in, the By-Laws. The phrase “whole Board” and the phrase “total number
of directors” shall be deemed, to have the same meaning, to wit, the total number of directors

21
which, the Corporation would have if there were no vacancies. No election of directors need be
by written ballot except as and to the extent provided in the By-Laws.

B. After the original or other By-Laws of the Corporation have been adopted,
amended or repealed, as the case may be, in accordance with the provisions of Section 109 of the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and, after the Corporation has received any
payment for any of its stock, the power to adopt, amend, or repeal the By-Laws of the
Corporation may be exercised by the Board; provided, however, that any provision for the
classification of directors of the Corporation for staggered terms pursuant to Section 141(d) of
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware shall be set forth in an initial By-Law or
in a By-Law adopted by the stockholders of the Corporation entitled to vote unless provisions for
such classification shall be set forth in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

C. Meetings of stockholders may be held within or without the State of
Delaware, as the By-Laws may provide. The books of the Corporation (subject to any provision
contained in the statutes of the State of Delaware) may be kept at such place within or without

the State of Delaware as the By-Laws of the Corporation may provide or as may be designated
from time to time by the Board.

SEVENTH: The Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by the
provisions of Section 145 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as the same
may be amended and supplemented from time to time, indemnify any and all persons whom it
shall have power to indemnify under said section from and against any and all of the expenses,
liabilities or other matters referred to in or covered by said section as amended or supplemented
(or any successor), and the indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of
any other rights to which those indemnified may be entitled under any By-Law, agreement, vote
of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his or her official
capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a
person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit
of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.

EIGHTH: No director shall be personally liable to the Corporation or its
stockholders for any monetary damages for breaches of fiduciary duty as a director,
notwithstanding any provision of law imposing such liability; provided that this provision shall
not eliminate or limit the liability of a director, to the extent that such liability is imposed by
applicable law: (a) subject to Article Ninth, for any breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to the
Corporation or its stockholders; (b) for acts or omissions by the director not in good faith or
which involve the director’s intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; (c) under
Section 174 or successor provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware; or
(d) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. This
provision shall not eliminate or limit the liability of a director for any act or omission if such
elimination or limitation is prohibited by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
No amendment to or repeal of this provision shall apply to or have any effect on the liability or
alleged liability of any director for or with respect to any acts or omissions of such director
occurring prior to such amendment or repeal. If the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware is amended to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal

22
liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or
limited to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as so amended.

NINTH: The Corporation hereby renounces, to the fullest extent permitted
by Section 122(17) of the Delaware Code, any interest or expectancy of the Corporation in, or in
being offered an opportunity to participate in, any business opportunities that are presented to
any Series A Director other than business opportunities that are presented to a Series A Director
acting in his or her capacity as a director of the Corporation. No amendment or repeal of this
Article shall apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged liability of any such director

for or with respect to any opportunities of which such director became aware prior to such
amendment or repeal.

TENTH: Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed between the
Corporation and its creditors or any class of them and/or between the Corporation and its
stockholders or any class of them, any court of equitable jurisdiction within the State of
Delaware may, on the application in a summary way of the Corporation or of any creditor or
stockholder thereof or on the application of any receiver or receivers appointed for the
Corporation under the provisions of Section 291 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code or on the
application of trustees in dissolution or of any receiver or receivers appointed for the Corporation
under the provisions of Section 279 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code, order a meeting of the
creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of the
Corporation, as the case may be, to be summoned in such manner as the said court directs. If a
majority in number representing three-fourths (3/4) in value of the creditors or class of creditors,
and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of the Corporation, as the case may be, agree
to any compromise or arrangement and to any reorganization of the Corporation as consequence
of such compromise or arrangement, the said compromise or arrangement and the said
reorganization shall, if sanctioned by the court to which the said application has been made, be
binding on all the creditors or class of creditors, and/or on all the stockholders or class of
stockholders, of the Corporation, as the case may be, and also on the Corporation.

ELEVENTH: From time to time any of the provisions of this Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation may be amended, altered, changed or repealed, and other
provisions authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware at the time in force may be added or
inserted in the manner and at the time prescribed by said laws, and all rights at any time
conferred upon the stockholders of the Corporation by this Amended and Restated Certificate of

Incorporation are granted subject to the provisions of this Article and this Amended and Restated
Certificate.

23
