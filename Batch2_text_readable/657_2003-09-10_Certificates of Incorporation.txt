distribution shall be distributed first, ratably among the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock in
proportion to the total preferential amount to which each such holder is entitled, second, ratably
among the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock in proportion to the total preferential amount
to which each such holder is entitled, and third, ratably among the holders of the Series A
Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock in proportion to the total preferential amount to
which each such holder is entitled.

power of this corporation; or (B) a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets

good faith by this corporation’s Board of Directors, except that any securities to be distributed to
the shareholders shall be valued as follows:

(A) Securities not subject to investment letter or other
similar restrictions on free marketability covered by (B) below:

(1) __siIf traded ona securities exchange or through

(B) The method of valuation of securities subject to
investment letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely
by virtue of a shareholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an
appropriate discount from the market value determined as above in (A) (1), (2) or (3) to reflect
the approximate fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by this corporation and the
holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of such Preferred
Stock.

Git) This corporation shall give each holder of record of
Preferred Stock written notice of such impending transaction not later than twenty (20) days prior
to the shareholders’ meeting called to approve such transaction, or twenty (20) days prior to the
closing of such transaction, whichever is earlier, and shal] also notify such holders in writing of

transaction shall in no event take place sooner than twenty (20) days after this corporation has
given the first notice provided for herein or sooner than ten (10) days after this corporation has
given notice of any material changes provided for herein; provided, however, that such periods
may be shortened upon the written consent of the holders of Preferred Stock that are entitled to
such notice rights or similar notice rights and that represent at least a majority of the voting
power of all then outstanding shares of such Preferred Stock.

3. Redemption. The Preferred Stock is not redeemable.

4, Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shal] have conversion
rights as follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be
convertible, at the option of the bolder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such
share, at the office of this corporation or any transfer agent for such stock, into such number of
fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Original
Issue Price of the applicable series of Preferred Stock by the Conversion Price applicable to such
share, determined as hereafter provided, in effect on the date the certificate is surrendered for
conversion. Upon the date of the filing of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation
with the Califomia Secretary of State (the “File Date”), the initial Conversion Price per share for
shares of (i) Series A Preferred Stock shall be $0.4369, (ii) Series B Preferred Stock shall be
$0.6377, (iii) Series C Preferred Stock.shall be $0.4300, and (iv) Series D Preferred Stock shall
be $0.4300; provided, however, that the respective Conversion Prices for the Preferred Stock
shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in subsection 4(d).

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall
automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Price at the time in
effect for such series of Preferred Stock immediately upon the earlier of (3) this corporation’s sale
of its Common Stock in a firm commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”), as amended, the
public offering price of which equals or exceeds $3.50 per share (adjusted to reflect subsequent
stock dividends, stock splits or recapitalization), with aggregate gross proceeds to this
corporation of at least $15,000,000, or (ii) the date specified by written consent or approval of
the holders of two-thirds of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a
single class.

(c) | Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock, the holder shal] surrender the
certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of this corporation or of any
transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to this corporation at its
principal corporate office, of the election to convert the same and shall state therein the name or
names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued. This
corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder
of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for
the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid. Such
conversion shal] be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the
date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons
entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated

231950001 L/DOCS/1362137.9 4
for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock as of such date.
If the conversion is in connection with an underwritten offering of securities registered pursuant
to the Securities Act, the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering Preferred Stock
for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of securities
pursuant to such offering, in which event the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock
upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred
Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities.

(d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock for Certain
Dilutive Issuances, Splits and Combinations. The respective Conversion Prices of the Preferred
Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

@) (A) | Series A and Series B Preferred Stock. If this
corporation shall issue or be deemed pursuant to the terms hereof to have issued, after the File
Date, any Additional Stock (as defmed below) without consideration or for a consideration per
share less than the then applicable Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred Stock or Series B
Preferred stock in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additiona] Stock, the
Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred Stock and/or Series B Preferred Stock in effect
immediately prior to each such issuance shall forthwith (except as otherwise provided in this
Section 4(d) (i)) be adjusted to a price determined by multiplying the then applicable Conversion
Price of the Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock by a fraction, (1) the numerator
of which shall be equal to the total computed under clause (x) below and (2) the denominator of
which shall be equal to the total computed under clause (y) below:

(x) an amount equal to the sum of (a) the number of shares of Outstanding
Common Stock (as such term is defined below) outstanding immediately
prior to such issue or sale, plus (b) the number of shares of Outstanding
Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received (or deemed
received) by this corporation for the total number of Additional Stock so
issued (or deemed issued) would purchase at such Conversion Price, and

(y) an amount equal to the sum of (a) the number of shares of Outstanding
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale plus
(b) the number of such Additional Stock so issued (or deemed issued).

As used herein, the term “Outstanding Common Stock” means all shares of Common Stock that
are outstanding plus all shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of Preferred Stock, or
the exercise of any outstanding options or warrants.

(B) _ Series C and Series D Pref Stock. If this
corporation shall issue or be deemed pursuant to the terms hereof to have issued, after the File
Date, any Additional Stock (as defined below) without consideration or for a consideration per
share less than the Series D Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such
Additional Stock, the Conversion Price for the Series C Preferred Stock and/or Series D
Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall (except as otherwise
provided in this Section 4(d)(i)) be adjusted, as of the opening of business on the date of such
issue or sale, to a price equal to the Effective Price (as defined below) of such issue or sale.

23195/0001 LDOCS/1362137.9 5

Additional Stock issued or sold, or deemed to have been issued or sold by the Company under

Preferred Stock shall be made in an amount less than one tenth of one cent per share, provided

years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward, or shall be
made at the end of three years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being
carried forward; and provided further that in all events any such adjustments which are not
required to be made by reason of this sentence (and which have not then been made) shall be
made immediately prior to conversion to Common Stock. Except to the limited extent provided
for in subsections (F}(3) and (F)(4), no adjustment of such Conversion Price pursuant to this
subsection 4(d)(i) shall have the effect of creasing the Conversion Price above the Conversion
Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment; provided, however, that in no case shall the
