agent as provided below, or the holder notifies the Company or its transfer agent that such
certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the

certificates. Upon the occurrence of such automatic conversion of the Preferred Stock, the
holders of Preferred Stock shall surrender the certificates representing such shares at the office of

Stock shall be $1.63 and shall be subject to adjustment for any applicable preferred stock split,
stock combination, stock dividend or similar event after the Original Issue Date. The.
“Conversion Amount” for the Series BB Preferred Stock shall be $1.63 and shall be subject to

such Common Stock Event by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which shall be the number of
shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to such Common Stock
Event, and (ii) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately after such Common Stock Event, and the product so obtained shall
thereafter be the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock. The Conversion Price for a
series of Preferred Stock shall be readjusted in the same manner upon the happening of each
subsequent Common Stock Event. As used herein, the term "Common Stock Event" shall mean
(i) the issue by the Company of additional shares of Common Stock as a dividend or other
distribution on outstanding Common Stock, (ii) a subdivision of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, or (iii) a combination of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock.

5.5 Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. If at any time or from
time to time after the Original Issue Date the Company pays a dividend or makes another
distribution to the holders of the Common Stock payable in securities of the Company other than
shares of Common Stock, then in each such event provision shall be made so that the holders of
each series of Preferred Stock shall then receive the amount of securities of the Company which
they would have received had their Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock on the
date of such event (or such record date, as applicable). This subsection 5.5 takes precedence over
Section 2, and accordingly dividends payable in securities of the Company other than shares of
Common Stock shall be governed by this subsection 5.5 and not Section 2.

5.6 Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. If at any time
or from time to time after the Original Issue Date the Common Stock issuable upon the
conversion of Preferred Stock is changed into the same or a different number of shares of any
class or classes of stock, whether by recapitalization, reclassification or otherwise (other than by
a Common Stock Event or a dividend covered by subsections 5.4 or 5.5, or a reorganization,
merger, consolidation or sale of assets provided for elsewhere in subsection 3.3 or subsection
5.7), then in any such event each holder of Preferred Stock shall have the right thereafter to
convert such stock into the kind and amount of stock and other securities and property receivable
upon such recapitalization, reclassification or other change by holders of the number of shares of
Common Stock into which such shares of Preferred Stock could have been converted _
immediately prior to such recapitalization, reclassification or change, all subject to further
adjustment as provided herein or with respect to such other securities or property by the terms
thereof.

5.7 Reorganizations, Mergers and Consolidations. If at any time or from time
to time after the Original Issue Date there is a reorganization of the Company (other than a
recapitalization, subdivision, combination, reclassification or exchange of shares provided for
elsewhere in this Section 5) or a merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another
corporation (except an event which is governed under subsection 3.3), then, as a part of such
reorganization, merger or consolidation, provision shall be made so that the holders of the
Preferred Stock thereafter shall be entitled to receive, upon conversion of the Preferred Stock, the
number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the Corporation, or of such successor
corporation resulting from such reorganization, merger or consolidation, to which a holder of

-1ll-

24185/00010/D0CS/1405583 .7
that number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock
immediately prior to the closing of such reorganization, merger or consolidation would have been
entitled on such reorganization, merger or consolidation. In any such case, appropriate
adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 5 with respect to the
rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock after the reorganization, merger or consolidation to
the end that the provisions of this Section 5 (including adjustment of the Conversion Price then
in effect and number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be
applicable after that event and be as nearly equivalent to the provisions hereof as may be
practicable. This subsection 5.7 shall similarly apply to successive reorganizations, mergers and

. consolidations.

5.8 Sale of Shares Below Conversion Price. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Article VI, (1) each reference to the Series AA Preferred Stock in this subsection
5.8 shall mean and refer only to the Series AA Preferred Stock and shall not mean or refer to the
Series AA-1 Preferred Stock; (ii) each reference to the Series BB Preferred Stock in this
subsection 5.8 shall mean and refer only to the Series BB Preferred Stock and shall not mean or
refer to the Series BB-1 Preferred Stock; and (iii) each reference to the Preferred Stock in this
subsection 5.8 shall mean and refer only to the Series AA Preferred Stock and the Series BB
Preferred Stock and shall not mean or refer to the Series AA-1 Preferred Stock or the Series BB-
1 Preferred Stock.

(a) Adjustment Formula. If at any time or from time to time after the
Original Issue Date the Company issues or sells, or is deemed by the provisions of this
subsection 5.8 to have issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock (as hereinafter
defined), otherwise than in connection with a Common Stock Event as provided in subsection
5.4, a dividend or distribution as provided in subsection 5.5, or a recapitalization, reclassification
or other change as provided in subsection 5.6 or 5.7, for an Effective Price (as hereinafter
defined) that is less than the Conversion Price for an outstanding series of Preferred Stock in
effect immediately prior to such issue or sale, then, and in each such case, the Conversion Price
for such series of Preferred Stock shall be reduced, as of the close of business on the date of such
issue or sale, to the price obtained by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction:

(i) The numerator of which shall be the sum of (A) the number
of Common Stock Equivalents Outstanding (as hereinafter defined) immediately prior to such
issue or sale of Additional Shares of Common Stock plus (B) the quotient obtained by dividing
the Aggregate Consideration Received (as hereinafter defined) by the Company for the total
number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued or sold (or deemed so issued and sold)
by the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such
issue or sale; and

(ii) | The denominator of which shall be the sum of (A) the
number of Common Stock Equivalents Outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale plus
(B) the number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued or sold (or deemed so issued
and sold).

-12-

24185/00010/D0CS/1405583.7
(b) Certain Definitions. For the purpose of making any adjustment
required under this subsection 5.8:

(i) "Additional Shares of Common Stock" shall mean all
shares of Common Stock issued by the Company, whether or not subsequently reacquired or
retired by the Company, other than: (A) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable upon
conversion of Preferred Stock; (B) shares of Series AA-1 Preferred Stock and Series BB-1
Preferred Stock issued upon conversion of Series AA Stock and Series BB Stock, respectively;
(C) shares of Common Stock (or options, warrants or rights directly or indirectly exercisable
therefore and the underlying Common Stock) outstanding on the Original Issue Date; (D) shares
of Common Stock (or options, warrants or rights directly or indirectly exercisable therefore and
the underlying Common Stock) issued to employees, officers or directors of, or contractors,
consultants or advisers to, the Company or any Subsidiary pursuant to stock purchase or stock
option plans, stock bonuses or awards, or other incentive stock arrangements that are approved
by the Board; (E) sale of up to an aggregate of 9,200,000 shares of Series BB Preferred Stock (F)
shares of Common Stock (or options, warrants or rights directly or indirectly exercisable
therefore and the underlying Common Stock) issued to lenders, equipment lessors, or other
parties providing goods or services to the Company, pursuant to contracts or other arrangements
that are unanimously approved by the Board pursuant to resolutions acknowledging that anti-
dilution protection is being waived with respect to the issuance of such shares.

Gi) The "Aggregate Consideration Received" by the Company
for any issue or sale (or deemed issue or sale) of securities shall (A) to the extent it consists of
cash, be computed at the gross amount of cash received by the Company before deduction of any
underwriting or similar commissions, compensation or concessions paid or allowed by the
Company in connection with such issue or sale and without deduction of any expenses payable
by the Company; (B) to the extent it consists of property other than cash, be computed at the fair
value of that property as determined in good faith by the Board; and (C) if Additional Shares of
Common Stock, Convertible Securities or Rights or Options to purchase either Additional Shares
of Common Stock or Convertible Securities are issued or sold together with other stock or
securities or other assets of the Company for a consideration which covers both, be computed as
the portion of the consideration so received that may be reasonably determined in good faith by
the Board to be allocable to such Additional Shares of Common Stock, Convertible Securities or
Rights or Options.

(iii) "Common Stock Equivalents Outstanding" shall mean the
number of shares of Common Stock that is equal to the sum of (A) all shares of Common Stock

_of the Company that are outstanding at the time in question, plus (B) all shares of Common Stock
of the Company issuable upon conversion of all shares of Preferred Stock or other Convertible
Securities that are outstanding at the time in question, plus (C) all shares of Common Stock of
the Company that are issuable upon the exercise of Rights or Options that are outstanding at the
time in question assuming the full conversion or exchange into Common Stock of all such Rights
or Options that are Rights or Options to purchase or acquire Convertible Securities into or for
Common Stock.

-13-

24185/00010/DO0CS/1405583.7
(iv) "Convertible Securities" shall mean stock or other
securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock.

(v) The "Effective Price" of Additional Shares of Common
Stock shall mean the quotient determined by dividing the total number of Additional Shares of
Common Stock issued or sold, or deemed to have been issued or sold, by the Company under this
subsection 5.8, into the Aggregate Consideration Received, or deemed to have been received, by
the Company under this subsection 5.8, for the issue of such Additional Shares of Common
Stock; and

(vi) "Rights or Options" shall mean warrants, options or other
rights to purchase or acquire shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities.

(c) Deemed Issuances. For the purpose of making any adjustment to
the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock required under this subsection 5.8, if the
Company issues or sells any Rights or Options or Convertible Securities and if the Effective
Price of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Rights or Options and/or the
conversion or exchange of Convertible Securities (computed without reference to any additional
or similar protective or antidilution clauses) is less than the Conversion Price then in effect for a
series of Preferred Stock, then the Company shall be deemed to have issued, at the time of the
issuance of such Rights, Options or Convertible Securities, that number of Additional Shares of
Common Stock that is equal to the maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
exercise or conversion of such Rights, Options or Convertible Securities upon their issuance and
to have received, as the Aggregate Consideration Received for the issuance of such shares, an
amount equal to the total amount of the consideration, if any, received by the Company for the
issuance of such Rights or Options or Convertible Securities, plus, in the case of such Rights or
Options, the minimum amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon the
exercise in full of such Rights or Options, plus, in the case of Convertible Securities, the
minimum amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Company (other than by cancellation
of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities) upon the conversion or
exchange thereof}; provided that:

(i) if the minimum amounts of such consideration cannot be
ascertained, but are a function of antidilution or similar protective clauses, then the Company
shall be deemed to have received the minimum amounts of consideration without reference to
such clauses;

(11) if the minimum amount of consideration payable to the
Company upon the exercise of Rights or Options or the conversion or exchange of Convertible
Securities is reduced over time or upon the occurrence or non-occurrence of specified events
other than by reason of antidilution or similar protective adjustments, then the Effective Price
shall be recalculated as of such date using the figure to which such minimum amount of -
consideration is reduced; and

(iii) if the minimum amount of consideration payable to the
Company upon the exercise of such Rights or Options or the conversion or exchange of

-14-

24185/00010/D0CS/1405583.7
Convertible Securities is subsequently increased, then the Effective Price shall again be
recalculated as of such date using the increased minimum amount of consideration payable to the
Company upon the exercise of such Rights or Options or the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities.

No further adjustment of the Conversion Price, adjusted upon the issuance of such Rights or
Options or Convertible Securities, shall be made as a result of the actual issuance of shares of
Common Stock on the exercise of any such Rights or Options or the conversion or exchange of
any such Convertible Securities. If any such Rights or Options or the conversion rights
represented by any such Convertible Securities shall expire without having been fully exercised,
then the Conversion Price as adjusted upon the issuance of such Rights or Options or Convertible
Securities shall be readjusted to the Conversion Price which would have been in effect had an
adjustment been made on the basis that the only shares of Common Stock so issued were the
shares of Common Stock, if any, that were actually issued or sold on the exercise of such Rights
or Options or rights of conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, and such shares of
Common Stock, if any, were issued or sold for the consideration actually received by the
Company upon such exercise, plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the Company
for the granting of all such Rights or Options, whether or not exercised, plus the consideration
received for issuing or selling all such Convertible Securities actually converted or exchanged,
plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the Company (other than by cancellation of
liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities) on the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, provided that such readjustment shall not apply to prior
conversions of Preferred Stock.

5.9 Certificate of Adjustment. In each case of an adjustment or readjustment
of the Conversion Price for a series of Preferred Stock, the Company, at its expense, shall cause
its Chief Financial Officer to compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the
provisions hereof and prepare a certificate showing such adjustment or readjustment, and shall
mail such certificate, by first class mail, postage prepaid, to each registered holder of the
Preferred Stock at the holder's address as shown in the Company's books.

5.10 Notices of Record Date. Upon (i) any taking by the Company of a record
of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof who
are entitled to receive any dividend or other distribution, or (ii) any Acquisition (as defined in
subsection 3.3) or other capital reorganization of the Company, any reclassification or
recapitalization of the capital stock of the Company, any merger or consolidation of the Company
with or into any other corporation, or any Asset Transfer (as defined in subsection 3.3), or any
voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company, the Company
shall mail to each holder of Preferred Stock at least twenty (20) days prior to the record date
specified therein a notice specifying (A) the date on which any such record is to be taken for the
purpose of such dividend or distribution and a description of such dividend or distribution,

(B) the date on which any such Acquisition, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization,
consolidation, merger, Asset Transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to
become effective, and (C) the date, if any, that is to be fixed as to when the holders of record of
Common Stock (or other securities) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock
(or other securities) for securities or other property deliverable upon such Acquisition,

-15-

24185/00010/D0CS/1405583.7
reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, consolidation, merger, Asset Transfer,
dissolution, liquidation or winding up.

5.11 Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued
upon any conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional share to which the holder
would otherwise be entitled, the Company shall pay the holder cash equal to the product of such
fraction multiplied by the Common Stock's fair market value as determined in good faith by the
Board as of the date of conversion.

5.12 Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Company shall at all
times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock,
solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock, such
number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, the Company will take such corporate
action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.

5.13 Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Section 5 to be
given to the holders of shares of the Preferred Stock shall be deemed given upon the earlier of
(1) actual receipt, (ii) deposit in the United States mail, by certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested, postage prepaid, or (iii) delivery to an express courier service, fees prepaid,
addressed to each holder of record at the address of such holder appearing on the books of the
Company.

5.14 Payment of Taxes. The Company will pay all taxes (other than taxes
based upon income) and other governmental charges that may be imposed with respect to the
issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of shares of Preferred Stock,
excluding any tax or other charge imposed in connection with any transfer involved in the issue
and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in which the shares of
Preferred Stock so converted were registered.

6. Restrictions and Limitations.

6.1 Protective Provisions. So long at least 300,000 shares of Preferred Stock
remain outstanding, the Company shall not, without the approval, by vote or written consent, of
the holders of at least two thirds (2/3) of the Preferred Stock then outstanding (determined on an
as-converted-to-common basis as set forth in subsection 4.2), voting as a single class (except to
the extent that separate series votes are required by law):

(1) amend its Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation or
bylaws in any manner that would adversely alter any of the rights, preferences, privileges or

24185/00010/DOCS/1405583.7
(2) amend its Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation to
increase or decrease the authorized number of shares of Common or Preferred Stock;

(3) authorize any other stock having rights, preferences or privileges
senior to or on a parity with any series of Preferred Stock;

(4) redeem or declare a dividend on any shares of Common Stock
(other than (i) pursuant to equity incentive agreements with employees or consultants giving the
Company the right to repurchase shares upon the termination of services, or (ii) pursuant to other
agreements providing for a right of repurchase by the Company as approved by the unanimous
consent of the Board);

(5) enter into an Acquisition or Asset Transfer;

(6) reclassify or recapitalize any outstanding shares of securities of the
Company;

(7). change the number of authorized directors provided for in

Determination and by way of merger, reorganization or otherwise) the Company’s Amended and
Restated Articles of Incorporation;

. (9) incur indebtedness for borrowed money in a single or related series
of transactions in an amount in excess of $500,000;

(10) _ establish a new equity incentive or stock option plan or increase
the number of authorized shares available under such any equity incentive or stock option plan;
or -

(11) initiate voluntary dissolution or liquidation of the Company.

7. Special Mandatory Conversion. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Article VI, (i) each reference to Series AA Preferred Stock in this Section 7 shall mean and refer
only to the Series AA Preferred Stock and not mean or refer to the Series AA-1 Preferred Stock;
(ii) each reference to Series BB Preferred Stock in this Section 7 shall mean and refer only to the
Series BB Preferred Stock and not mean or refer to the Series BB-1 Preferred Stock; and each
reference to the Preferred Stock in this Section 7 shall mean and refer only to the Series AA
Preferred Stock and the Series BB Preferred Stock and not mean or refer to the Series AA-1
Preferred Stock or the Series BB-1 Preferred Stock.

71 In the event that:
(i) the Company consummates an equity financing pursuant to which

any holders of Preferred Stock are entitled to exercise the right of first refusal (the “Right of First
Refusal”) set forth in Section 3 of the Amended and Restated Investors’ Rights Agreement

-17-

24185/00010/DOCS/1405583.7
\

entered into by and between the Company and various parties thereto on the Original Issue Date,
as amended thereafter (the “Investors’ Rights Agreement’’);

(ii) the Effective Price (as defined above) per share of any securities
being sold in such financing is less than the then-current Conversion Price of the Series BB
Preferred Stock and a majority of the Board determines (with interested directors able to vote for
purposes of this subsection 7.1) that it is in the best interests of the Company for the holders of
Preferred Stock to participate in such financing (in which case such financing will be deemed a
“Mandatory Offering”) and determines the aggregate dollar amount to be invested by all holders
of Preferred Stock (the “Aggregate Investment Amount”), which amount may be more or less
than the amount which the holders would have a right to purchase pursuant to the exercise of the
Right of First Refusal;

(iii) the Company delivers a notice (“Notice”) to the holders of
Preferred Stock (1) stating the Company’s bona fide intention to consummate such a financing,
(2) indicating the number of securities to be offered, (3) indicating the price and general terms
upon which it proposes to offer such securities, (4) identifying the Pro Rata Share (as defined
below) of each holder of Preferred Stock of the Aggregate Investment Amount, and (5) offering
each holder of Preferred Stock the right to purchase such holder’s Pro Rata Share of the
Aggregate Investment Amount within the time periods set forth in the Notice; and

(iv) a holder (a “Non-Participating Holder’) (together with any affiliate
of such holder, and/or a designee of such holder who is approved by a majority of the Board)
does not acquire, collectively, at least the holder’s Pro Rata Share of the Aggregate Investment
Amount within the time periods set forth in the Notice (which periods cannot, in any event,
require that the holder acquire such securities within less than twenty (20) calendar days from the
date that the Notice is deemed to have been given in accordance with the notice provisions of
Section 5.1 of the Investors’ Rights Agreement);

then all of such Non-Participating Holder’s shares of Series AA Preferred Stock and Series BB
Preferred Stock shall automatically and without further action on the part of such Non-
Participating Holder’s be converted into an equal number of shares of Series AA-1 Preferred
Stock and Series BB-1 Preferred Stock, respectively, effective subject to and concurrently with
the closing of the Mandatory Offering (the “Mandatory Offering Date”). As used herein, a
holder’s “Pro Rata Share” means the ratio of (a) the total number of shares of Common Stock (i)
then held by such holder on account of the prior conversion of shares of Preferred Stock into
such Common Stock, plus (ii) then issuable on account of all shares of Preferred Stock then held
by such holder, to (b) the total number of shares of Common Stock (i) then held by all holders of
Preferred Stock on account of the prior conversion of shares of Preferred Stock into such
Common Stock, plus (ii) then issuable on account of all shares of Preferred Stock then held by all
such holders. Upon such conversion, the shares of Series AA Preferred Stock and Series BB
Preferred Stock so converted shall be canceled and not subject to reissuance. Notwithstanding
anything in this Article VI to the contrary, the initial Conversion Price of any Series AA-1 issued
upon such conversion on the Mandatory Offering Date shall be a dollar amount equal to the
Conversion Price of the Series AA Preferred Stock as of immediately prior to the initial closing

- 18 -

24185/00010/DO0CS/1405583.7
of the Mandatory Offering, and the initial Conversion Price of any Series BB-1 issued upon such
conversion on the Mandatory Offering Date shall be a dollar amount equal to the Conversion
Price of the Series BB Preferred Stock as of immediately prior to the initial closing of the
Mandatory Offering.

7.2 The holder of any shares of Series AA Preferred Stock and/or Series BB
Preferred Stock converted pursuant to subsection 7.1 hereof, shall deliver to the Company during |
regular business hours at the office of any transfer agent of the Company for the Preferred Stock,
or at such other place as may be designated by the Company, the certificate or certificates for the
shares so converted, duly endorsed or assigned in blank or to the Company. As promptly as
practicable thereafter, the Company shall issue and deliver to such holder, at the place designated
by such holder, a certificate or certificates for a corresponding number of shares of Series AA-1
Preferred Stock and/or Series BB-1 Preferred Stock, as applicable. The person in whose name
the certificate for such Series AA-1 Preferred Stock and/or Series BB-1 Preferred Stock is to be
issued shall be deemed to have become a stockholder of record with respect to such Series AA-1
Preferred Stock and/or Series BB-1 Preferred Stock, as applicable, on the Mandatory Offering
Date and will not be deemed a holder of shares of Series AA Preferred Stock or Series BB
Preferred Stock for any purposes thereafter.

7.3 In the event that any shares of Series AA-1 Preferred Stock or Series BB-1
Preferred Stock are issued upon a Mandatory Offering pursuant to this Section 7, the Company,
concurrently with such issuance, shall use diligent efforts to take all such action as may be
required, including amending its Articles of Incorporation, to (a) cancel all authorized shares of
Series AA-1 Preferred Stock and Series BB-1 Preferred Stock, as applicable, that remain
unissued following the conversion effected on the Mandatory Offering Date; (b) cancel all
authorized shares of Series AA Preferred Stock and Series BB Preferred Stock, as applicable,
that are no longer outstanding as a result of the conversion effected on the Mandatory Offering
Date; (c) create and reserve for issuance upon a subsequent Mandatory Offering new series of
preferred stock (to be designated “Series AA-2 Preferred Stock” and “Series BB-2 Preferred
Stock”) having numbers of shares equal in number, respectively, to the number of shares of
Series AA Preferred Stock and Series BB Preferred Stock, respectively, remaining outstanding
immediately following the Mandatory Offering Date, with powers, preferences and rights and the
qualifications, limitations and restrictions identical to those then applicable to the Series AA-1
Preferred Stock and Series BB-1 Preferred Stock, respectively, except that the Conversion Prices
for such shares of Series AA-2 Preferred Stock and such shares of Series BB-2 Preferred Stock,
respectively, once initially issued shall be the Series AA Preferred Stock Conversion Price and
the Series BB Preferred Stock Conversion Price, respectively, in effect immediately prior to such
issuance; and (d) amend the provisions of this subsection 7.3 to provide that any subsequent
conversion of shares of Series AA Preferred Stock and Series BB Preferred Stock in a subsequent
Mandatory Offering will be into shares of Series AA-2 Preferred Stock and Series BB-2
Preferred Stock, respectively. The Company shall take the same actions with respect to the
Series AA-2 Preferred Stock and Series BB-2 Preferred Stock, respectively, and each new similar
series of preferred stock subsequently authorized pursuant to this subsection 7.3 (i.e., the Series
AA-3 and BB-3 Preferred Stock, the Series AA-4 and BB-4 Preferred Stock, etc.) upon initial
issuance of shares of the last such series to be authorized. The right to receive any dividend

-19-

24185/00010/D0CS/1405583.7
declared but unpaid at the time of conversion of any shares of Series AA Preferred Stock or
Series BB Preferred Stock converted pursuant to. the provisions of this subsection 7.3 shall
accrue to the benefit of the new shares of preferred stock issued upon conversion thereof.

8. Miscellaneous

8.1 No Reissuance of Preferred Stock. No share or shares of Preferred Stock
acquired by the Company by reason of purchase, conversion or otherwise shall be reissued, and
all such shares shall be canceled, retired and eliminated from the shares which the Company shall
be authorized to issue.

8.2 Consent to Certain Transactions. Each holder of shares of Preferred Stock
shall, by virtue of its acceptance of a stock certificate evidencing Preferred Stock, be deemed to
have consented, for purposes of Sections 502 and 503 of the California Corporations Code, to all
Permitted Repurchases.
