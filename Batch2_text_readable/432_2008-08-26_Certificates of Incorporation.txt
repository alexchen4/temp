“Liquidation Event”), whether voluntary or involuntary, before any payment shall be made to
the holders of any Common Stock, the Series C Preferred, the Series B Preferred or any other
capital stock of the Company (including preferred stock authorized after the date hereof in
accordance with the terms hereof), the holders of the shares of Series D Preferred and Series E
Preferred shall be paid, on a pari passu basis, out of the assets of the Company legally available
for distribution, or the consideration received in such transaction, for each share of Series D
Preferred or Series E Preferred held by them, an amount per share of Series D Preferred or Series

Original Issue Price (as applicable) (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits,
recapitalizations and the like with respect to such shares after the filing date hereof) plus (y) all
accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series D Preferred and the Series E Preferred. If, upon any
such liquidation, dissolution, or winding up, the assets of the Company (or the consideration
received in such transaction) shall be insufficient to make payment in full to all holders of the
Series D Preferred and the Series E Preferred of the liquidation preference set forth in this
Paragraph 3A(a), then such assets (or consideration) shall be distributed among the holders of the
Series D Preferred and Series E Preferred at the time outstanding, ratably in proportion to the full
amounts to which they would otherwise be respectively entitled.

After the payment of the full liquidation preference of the Series D
Preferred and Series E Preferred as set forth in Paragraph 3A(a) above, before any payment shall
be made to the holders of any Common Stock, the Series B Preferred or any capital stock ranking
on hquidation junior to the Series C Preferred, the holders of the shares of Series C Preferred
shall be paid out of the assets of the Company legally available for distribution, or the
consideration received in such transaction, for each share of Series C Preferred held by them, an
amount per share of Series C Preferred equal to (x) the Series C Liquidation Factor multiplied by
(ii) the Series C Original Issue Price (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits,
recapitalizations and the like with respect to such shares after the filing date hereof), plus (y) all
accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series C Preferred. The “Series C Liquidation Factor”
shall be equal to the following formula:

\6382266.4
C200823900084

[$18,750,000 + (3*A)]
($15,000,000 + A]

Where A = (I) the Series D Original Issue Price multiplied by (II) the total number of shares of
Series D Preferred, in the aggregate, which are issued by the Corporation (whether or not still
outstanding at such time).

If, upon any such liquidation, dissolution, or winding up, the assets of the Company (or the
consideration received in such transaction) shall be insufficient to make payment in full to all
holders of the Series C Preferred of the liquidation preference set forth in this Paragraph 3A(b),
then such assets (or consideration) shall be distributed among the holders of the Series C
Preferred at the time outstanding, ratably in proportion to the full amounts to which they would
otherwise be respectively entitled.

(c) After the payment of the full liquidation preference of the Series D
Preferred and Series E Preferred as set forth in Paragraph 3 A(a) above and the Series C Preferred
as set forth in Paragraph 3A(b) above, before any payment shall be made to the holders of any
Common Stock or any capital stock ranking on liquidation junior to the Series B Preferred, the
holders of the shares of Series B Preferred shall be paid out of the assets of the Company legally
available for distribution, or the consideration received in such transaction, for each share of
Series B Preferred held by them, an amount per share of Series B Preferred equal to (x) 1.25
multiplied by the Series B Original Issue Price (as adjusted for any stock dividends,
combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like with respect to such shares after the filing date
hereof) plus (y) all accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series B Preferred. If, upon any such
liquidation, dissolution, or winding up, the assets of the Company (or the consideration received
in such transaction) shall be insufficient to make payment in full to all holders of the Series B
Preferred of the liquidation preference set forth in this Paragraph 3A(c), then such assets (or
consideration) shall be distributed among the holders of the Series B Preferred at the time
outstanding, ratably in proportion to the full amounts to which they would otherwise be
respectively entitled.

(d) After the payment of the full liquidation preferences of the Series E
Preferred, Series D Preferred, the Series C Preferred and the Series B Preferred as set forth in
Paragraphs 3A(a), (b) and (c) above, the assets of the Company legally available for distribution
in such Liquidation Event (or the consideration received in such transaction), if any, shall be
distributed ratably to the holders of the Common Stock.

(e) Written notice of such liquidation, dissolution or winding up, stating a
payment date and the place where said payments shall be made, shall be given by mail, postage
prepaid, or by facsimile to non-U.S. residents, not less than ten (10) days prior to the payment
date stated therein, to the holders of record of the Preferred Stock, such notice to be addressed to
each such holder at its address as shown by the records of the Company.

with any other entity or entities (except a consolidation or merger into a Subsidiary or merger in

outstanding immediately prior to the transaction constitute the holders of a majority of the voting

disposition by the Company of all or substantially all its assets, or (iii) the sale, exchange or
transfer by the Company’s stockholders, in a single transaction or series of related transactions,

and not the provisions of subparagraph 4G hereof, unless subparagraph 4G is elected in the
following proviso), provided, however, that the holders of at least a majority in interest of the

_ C Preferred and/or the holders of at least a majority in interest of the then outstanding shares of
Series B Preferred shall have the right, on behalf of each such respective Series, to elect the
benefits of the provisions of subparagraph 4G in lieu of receiving payment in liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Company pursuant to this Paragraph 3.

nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is obtained by (i) multiplying the number of shares of
Series B Preferred so to be converted by $0.42 per share and (ii) dividing the result by the
conversion price of $0.42 per share or in case an adjustment of such price has taken place
pursuant to the further provisions of this Paragraph 4, then by the conversion price of the Series

nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is obtained by (i) multiplying the number of shares of

of conversion shall terminate at the close of business on the business day fixed for payment of
the amounts distributable on the Series E Preferred) into such number of fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is obtained by (i) multiplying the number of shares of
Series E Preferred so to be converted by $0.50868 per share and (ii) dividing the result by the
conversion price of $0.50868 per share or in case an adjustment of such price has taken place
pursuant to the further provisions of this Paragraph 4, then by the conversion price of the Series
E Preferred as last adjusted and in effect at the date any share or shares of Series E Preferred are
surrendered for conversion (such price, or such price as last adjusted, being referred to as the
“Series E Conversion Price” and, together with the Series D Conversion Price, Series C
Conversion Price and the Series B Conversion Price, each, a “Conversion Price”).

(e) Such rights of conversion shall be exercised by the holder thereof by

certificates for the shares so to be converted to the Company at its principal office (or such other
office or agency of the Company as the Company may designate by notice in writing to the
holders of the Preferred Stock) at any time during its usual business hours on the date set forth in
such notice, together with a statement of the name or names (with address) in which the
certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock shall be issued. Notwithstanding any other
provisions hereof, if a conversion of any Preferred Stock is to be made in connection with any
transaction affecting the Company, the conversion of any shares of Preferred Stock, may, at the
election of the holder thereof, be conditioned upon the consummation of such transaction, in
which case such conversion shall not be deemed to be effective until such transaction has been
consummated, subject in all events to the terms hereof applicable to such transaction.

4B. ' Issuance _of Certificates; Time Conversion Effected. Promptly after the
receipt of the written notice referred to in Paragraph 4A and surrender of the certificate or
9

\6382266.4
€200823900084

certificates for the share or shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, the Company shall issue
and deliver, or cause to be issued and delivered, to the holder, registered in such name or names
as such holder may direct, a certificate or certificates for the number of whole shares of Common
Stock issuable upon the conversion of such share or shares of Preferred Stock. To the extent
permitted by law, such conversion shall be deemed to have been effected and the Conversion
Price of the applicable series shall be determined as of the close of business on the date on which
such written notice shall have been received by the Company and the certificate or certificates
for such share or shares shall have been surrendered as aforesaid, and at such time the rights of
the holder of such share or shares of Preferred Stock shall cease, and the person or persons in
whose name or names any certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock shall be
issuable upon such conversion shall be deemed to have become the holder or holders of record of
the shares represented thereby. °

4C, Fractional Shares; Partial Conversion. No fractional shares shall be issued
upon conversion of Preferred Stock into the Common Stock and no payment or adjustment shall
be made upon any such conversion with respect to any cash dividends previously payable on the
Common Stock issued upon such conversion. In case the number of shares of Preferred Stock
represented by the certificate or certificates surrendered pursuant to Paragraph 4A exceeds the
number of shares converted, the Company shall, upon such conversion, execute and deliver to
the holder, at the expense of the Company, a new certificate or certificates for the number of
shares of Preferred Stock represented by the certificate or certificates surrendered which are not
to be converted. If any fractional share of Common Stock would, except for the provisions of
the first sentence of this Paragraph 4C, be delivered upon such conversion, the Company, in lieu
of delivering such fractional share, shall pay to the holder surrendering Preferred Stock for
conversion an amount in cash equal to the current market price of such fractional share as
determined in good faith by the Board, and based upon the aggregate number of shares of
Preferred Stock surrendered by any one holder of such series.

4D. Adjustment of Series B Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price, Series D

Conversion Price or Series E Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Common Stock Below the
Series B Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price, Series D Conversion Price or Series E

Conversion Price. Except as provided in Paragraphs 4E and 4F, if and whenever the Company
shall issue or sell, or is, in accordance with subparagraphs 4D(1) through 4D(7), deemed to have
issued or sold, any shares of Common Stock for a consideration per share Jess than the Series B
Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price, Series D Conversion Price or Series E Conversion
Price, as applicable, in effect immediately prior to the time of such issue or sale (such Series B
Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price, Series D Conversion Price or Series E Conversion
Price, as applicable, the “Applicable Conversion Price”) (such number being appropriately
adjusted to reflect the occurrence of any event described in Paragraph 4F), then, forthwith upon
such issue or sale, the Applicable Conversion Price shall be reduced to the price (calculated to
the nearest cent) determined by multiplying such Applicable Conversion Price by a fraction, (i)
the numerator of which shall be an amount equal to the sum of (a) the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale (including, for this purpose,
shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of outstanding Preferred Stock and the
exercise of outstanding Options) and (b) the number of shares of Common Stock which the
aggregate consideration received by the Company for the total number of shares of Common
Stock so issued (or deemed issued pursuant to this Paragraph 4) would purchase at such

10

\6382266.4
€200823900084

Applicable Conversion Price, and (ii) the denominator of which shall be an amount equal to the

sum of

(a) the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such

issue or sale (including, for this purpose, shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of
outstanding Preferred Stock and the exercise of outstanding Options) and (b) the total number of
shares of Common Stock issued (or deemed issued pursuant to this Paragraph 4) in such issue or

sale.

\6382266.4

4D(1) Issuance of Rights or Options. In case at any time the Company shall in
any manner grant (whether directly or by assumption in a merger or otherwise) any
warrants or other rights to subscribe for or to purchase, or any options for the purchase of,
Common Stock or any stock or security convertible into or exchangeable for Common
Stock (such warrants, rights or options being called “Options” and such convertible or
exchangeable stock or securities being called “Convertible Securities”) whether or not
such Options or the right to convert or exchange any such Convertible Securities are
immediately exercisable, and the price per share for which Common Stock is issuable
upon the exercise of such Options or upon the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities (determined by dividing (i) the total amount, if any, received or
receivable by the Company as consideration for the granting of such Options, plus the
minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration payable to the Company upon the
exercise of all such Options, plus, in the case of such Options which relate to Convertible
Securities, the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable
upon the issue or sale of such Convertible Securities and upon the conversion or
exchange thereof, by (ii) the total maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable
upon the exercise of such Options or upon the conversion or exchange of all such
Convertible Securities issuable upon the exercise of such Options) shall be less than the
Applicable Conversion Price for a particular series of Preferred Stock in effect
immediately prior to the time of the granting of such Options, then the total maximum
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Options or upon
conversion or exchange of the total maximum amount of such Convertible Securities
issuable upon the exercise of such Options shall be deemed to have been issued for such
price per share as of the date of granting of such Options or the issuance of such
Convertible Securities and thereafter shall be deemed to be outstanding. Except as
otherwise provided in subparagraph 4D(3), no adjustment of the Applicable Conversion
Price for the particular series of Preferred Stock shall be made upon the actual issue of
such Common Stock or of such Convertible Securities upon exercise of such Options or
upon the actual issue of such Common Stock upon conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities.

4D(2) Issuance of Convertible Securities. In case the Company shall in any
manner issue (whether directly or by assumption in a merger or otherwise) or sell any
Convertible Securities, whether or not the rights to exchange or convert any such
Convertible Securities are immediately exercisable, and the price per share for which
Common Stock is issuable upon such conversion or exchange (determined by dividing (i)
the total amount received or receivable by the Company as consideration for the issue or

11
\6382266.4

€200823900084

sale of such Convertible Securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional
consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon the conversion or exchange thereof,
by (ii) the total maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the
conversion or exchange of all such Convertible Securities) shall be less than the
Applicable Conversion Price with respect to a particular series of Preferred Stock in
effect immediately prior to the time of such issue or sale, then the total maximum number
of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exchange of all such
Convertible Securities shall be deemed to have been issued for such price per share as of
the date of the issue or sale of such Convertible Securities and thereafter shall be deemed
to be outstanding, provided that (a) except as otherwise provided in subparagraph 4D(3),
no adjustment of the Applicable Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock shall
be made upon the actual issue of such Common Stock upon conversion or exchange of
such Convertible Securities and (b) if any such issue or sale of such Convertible
Securities is made upon exercise of any Options to purchase any such Convertible
Securities for which adjustments of the Applicable Conversion Price of such series of
Preferred Stock have been or are to be made pursuant to other provisions of this
Paragraph 4D, no further adjustment of such Applicable Conversion Price shall be made
by reason of such issue or sale.

4D(3) Change in Option Price or Conversion Rate. Upon the happening of any
of the following events, namely, if the purchase price provided for in any Option referred
to in subparagraph 4D(1), the additional consideration, if any, payable upon the
conversion or exchange of any Convertible Securities referred to in subparagraph 4D(1)
or 4D(2), or the rate at which Convertible Securities referred to in subparagraph 4D(1) or
4D(2) are convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock shall change at any time
(including, but not limited to, changes under or by reason of provisions designed to
protect against dilution), the Applicable Conversion Price with respect to a particular
series of Preferred Stock in effect at the time of such event shall forthwith be readjusted
(in each case by an amount equal to not less than one cent ($0.01)) to the Applicable
Conversion Price which would have been in effect at such time had such Options or
Convertible Securities still outstanding provided for such changed purchase price,
additional consideration or conversion rate, as the case may be, at the time initially
granted, issued or sold; and on the expiration of any such Option or the termination of
any such right to convert or exchange such Convertible Securities, the Applicable
Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock then in effect hereunder shall
forthwith be increased to the Applicable Conversion Price which would have been in
effect at the time of such expiration or termination had such Option or Convertible
Securities, to the extent outstanding immediately prior to such expiration or termination,
never been issued.

4D(4) Stock Dividends. In case the Company shall declare a dividend or make
any other distribution upon any stock of the Company payable in Common Stock (except
for the issue of stock dividends or distributions upon the outstanding Common Stock for
which adjustment is made pursuant to Paragraph 4F), Options or Convertible Securities,
any Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities, as the case may be, issuable in
payment of such dividend or distribution shall be deemed to have been issued or sold

12
€200823900084

4D(5) Consideration for Stock. In case any shares of Common Stock, Options or
Convertible Securities shall be issued or sold for cash, the consideration received therefor
shall be deemed to be the amount received by the Company therefor, without deduction
therefrom of any expenses incurred or any underwriting commissions or concessions paid
or allowed by the Company in connection therewith. In case any shares of Common
Stock, Options or Convertible Securities shall be issued or sold for a consideration other
than cash, the amount of the consideration other than cash received by the Company shall
be deemed to be the fair value of such consideration as determined in good faith by the
Board, without deduction of any expenses incurred or any underwriting commissions or
concessions paid or allowed by the Company in connection therewith. In case any
Options shall be issued in connection with the issue and sale of other securities of the
Company, together comprising one integral transaction in which no _ specific
consideration is allocated to such Options by the parties thereto, such Options shall be
deemed to have been issued for such consideration as determined in good faith by the
Board.

4D(6) Record Date. In case the Company shall take a record of the holders of its
Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them (i) to receive a dividend or other
distribution payable in Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities or (ii) to
subscribe for or purchase Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities, then such
record date shall be deemed to be the date of the issue or sale of the shares of Common
Stock deemed to have been issued or sold upon the declaration of such dividend or the
making of such other distribution or the date of the granting of such right of subscription
or purchase, as the case may be.

4D(7) Treasury Shares. The number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at
any given time shall not include shares owned or held by or for the account of the
Company, and the disposition of any such shares shall be considered an issue or sale of
Common Stock for the purpose of this Paragraph 4D.

4E. Certain Issues of Common Stock Excepted. Anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Company shall not be required to make any adjustment of any Applicable
Conversion Price in the case of the:

into after the Original Issue Date that have been approved by the affirmative vote of the holders
of at least a majority of the shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a class;

split, stock dividend or any subdivision of shares of Common Stock; and

13
\6382266.4
€200823900084

(v) grant (whether directly or by assumption in a merger or
otherwise) of any warrants or other rights to subscribe for or to purchase, or any options for the
purchase of, Reserved Incentive Shares (as defined in Paragraph 5 hereof), or the actual issuance
of Reserved Incentive Shares.

4F. Subdivision or Combination of Common Stock. In case the Company shall at
any time subdivide (by any stock split, stock dividend or otherwise) its outstanding shares of
Common Stock into a greater number of shares, each Applicable Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such subdivision shall be proportionately reduced, and, conversely, in case
the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined into a smaller number of shares,
each Applicable Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such combination shall be
proportionately increased.

4G. Reorganization or Reclassification. If any capital reorganization,
reclassification, recapitalization, consolidation, merger, sale of all or substantially all of the

Company’s assets or other similar transaction (any such transaction being referred to herein as an
“Organic Change”) shall be effected in such a way that holders of Common Stock shal] be
entitled to receive (either directly or upon subsequent liquidation) stock, securities or assets with
respect to or in exchange for Common Stock, then, as a condition of such Organic Change,
lawful and adequate provisions shall be made whereby each holder of a share or shares of
Preferred Stock shall thereupon have the right to receive, upon the basis and upon the terms and
conditions specified herein and in lieu of or in addition to, as the case may be, the shares of
Common Stock immediately theretofore receivable upon the conversion of such share or shares
of Preferred Stock such shares of stock, securities or assets as may be issued or payable with
respect to or in exchange for a number of outstanding shares of such Common Stock equal to the
number of shares of such Common Stock immediately theretofore receivable upon such
conversion had such Organic Change not taken place, and in any case of a reorganization or
reclassification only appropriate provisions shall be made with respect to the rights and interests
of such holder to the end that the provisions hereof (including without limitation provisions for
adjustments of each Applicable Conversion Price) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as may
be, in relation to any shares of stock, securities or assets thereafter deliverable upon the exercise
of such conversion rights.

4H. Notice of Adjustment. Upon any adjustment of any Applicable Conversion
Price, then and in each such case the Company shall give written notice thereof, by first class
mail, postage prepaid, or by facsimile transmission to non-U.S. residents, addressed to each
holder of shares of any affected series of Preferred Stock at the address of such holder as shown
on the books of the Company, which notice shall state the Applicable Conversion Price for each

winding up of the Company;

then, in any one or more of said cases, the Company shall give, by first class mail, postage

available out of its authorized Common Stock, solely for the purpose of issuance upon the
conversion of Preferred Stock as herein provided, such number of shares of Common Stock as

Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock which shall be so issued shall be duly and
validly issued and fully paid and nonassessable and free from all taxes, liens and charges with

covenants that it will from time to time take all such action as may be requisite to assure that the
par value per share of Common Stock is at all times equal to or less than the Applicable
Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock in effect at the time, The Company will take
all such action as may be necessary to assure that all such shares of Common Stock may be so
issued without violation of any applicable law or regulation, or of any requirement of any
national securities exchange upon which the Common Stock may be listed.

4K, No_ Reissuance of Preferred Stock. Shares of Preferred Stock which are
converted into shares of Common Stock as provided herein shall not be reissued.

4L. Issue Tax. The issuance of certificates for shares of Common Stock upon
conversion of Preferred Stock shall be made without charge to the holders thereof for any

€200823900084

certificate in a name other than that of the holder of the Preferred Stock which is being
converted.

4M. Closing of Books. The Company will at no time close its transfer books
against the transfer of any shares of Preferred Stock or of any shares of Common Stock issued or
issuable upon the conversion of any shares of Preferred Stock, in any manner which interferes
with the timely conversion of such Preferred Stock except as may otherwise be required to
comply with applicable securities laws.
