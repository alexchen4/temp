means of any transaction or series of related transactions (including, without limitation, any stock
acquisition, reorganization, merger or consolidation but excluding any sale of stock for capital raising
purposes) other than a transaction or series of transactions in which the holders of the voting securities of the
Corporation outstanding immediately prior to such transaction continue to retain (either by such voting
securities remaining outstanding or by such voting securities being converted into voting securities of the
surviving entity), as a result of shares in the Corporation held by such holders prior to such transaction, at
least a majority of the total voting power represented by the voting securities of the Corporation or such
surviving entity outstanding immediately after such transaction or series of transactions; (b) a sale, lease or
other conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation; or (c) any liquidation, dissolution
or winding up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary. -

(f) Valuation of Non-Cash Consideration. If any assets of the Corporation distributed to
stockholders in connection with any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation are other than
cash, then the value of such assets shall be their fair market value as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors, except that unless otherwise valued in a merger or acquisition agreement approved by the
Corporation's stockholders any publicly-traded securities to be distributed to stockholders in a liquidation,
dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation shall be valued as follows:

(i) If the securities are then traded on a national securities exchange or the
Nasdaq Stock Market (or a similar national quotation system), then the value of the securities shall be
deemed to be to the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange or system over the ten
(10) trading day period ending five (5) trading days prior to the Distribution;

PALIB2 2882027_3 ~4-
(ii) if the securities are actively traded over-the-counter, then the value of the
securities shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid prices of the securities over the ten
(10) trading day period ending five (5) trading days prior to the Distribution.

In the event of a merger or other acquisition of the Corporation by another entity, the Distribution
date shall be deemed to be the date such transaction closes.

For the purposes of this Section 3(f), “trading day” shall mean any day which the exchange or
system on which the securities to be distributed are traded is open and “closing prices” or “closing bid
prices” shall be deemed to be: (i) for securities traded primarily on the New York Stock Exchange, the
American Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, the last reported trade price or sale price, as the case may be, at 4:00
p.m., New York time, on that day and (ii) for securities listed or traded on other exchanges, markets and
systems, the market price as of the end of the regular hours trading period thal is generally accepted as such
_ for such exchange, market or system. If, after the date hereof, the benchmark times generally accepted in the
securities industry for determining the market price of a stock as of a given trading day shall change from
thosc set forth above, the fair market value shall be determined as of such other generally accepted
benchmark times.

4, Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as follows (the
“Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of
the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share at the office of the Corporation or any
transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, into that number of fully-paid, nonassessable shares of Common Stock
detcrmined by dividing the Original Issue Price for the relevant series by the Conversion Price for such
series. (The number of shares of Common Stock into which each share of Preferred Stock of a series may be
converted is hereinafter referred to as the “Conversion Rate” for each such series.) Upon any decrease or
increase in the Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock, as described in this Section 4, the
Conversion Rate for such series shall be appropriately increased or decreased.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be
converted into fully-paid, non-assessable shares of Common Stock at the then effective Conversion Rate for
such share (i) immediately prior to the closing of a firm commitment underwritten public offering pursuant
to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act’),
covering the offer and sale of the Corporation’s Common Stock, provided that the offering price per share
(prior to underwriting commissions and offering expenses) is not less than $4.14 (as adjusted for
Recapitalizations) and the aggregate gross proceeds to the Corporation are not less than $15,000,000 or
(ii) upon the receipt by the Corporation of a written request for such conversion from the holders of a
majority of the Preferred Stock then outstanding (calculated on an as-converted basis), or, if later, the
effective date for conversion specified in such requests (each of the events referred to in (i) and (ii) are
referred to herein as an “Automatic Conversion Event”).

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of Common.Stock shall be issued
upon conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would otherwise be
entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the then fair market value of a
share of Common Stock as determined by the Board of Directors. For such purpose, all shares of Preferred
Stock held by each holder of Preferred Stock shall be aggregated, and any resulting fractional share of
Common Stock shall be paid in cash. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the

PALIB2 2883027 3 -3-
same into full shares of Common Stock, and to receive certificates therefor, they shall either (A) surrender
the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent
for the Preferred Stock or (B) notify the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost,
stolen or destroyed and execute an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation
from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates, and shall give written notice to the
Corporation at such office that they elect to convert the same; provided, however, that on the date of an
Automatic Conversion Event, the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically
without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates representing such
shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent; provided further, however, that the
Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon
such Automatic Conversion Event unless either the certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are
delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent as provided above, or the holder notifies the Corporation or
its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement
satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with
such certificates. On the date of the occurrence of an Automatic Conversion Event, each holder of record of
shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the Common Stock issuable upon
such conversion, notwithstanding that the certificates representing such shares of Preferred Stock shalt not
have heen surrendered at the office of the Corporation, that notice from the Corporation shall not have been
received by any holder of record of shares of Preferred Stock, or that the certificates evidencing such shares
of Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered to such holder.

The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after such delivery, or after such agreement and
indemnification, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, a certificate or certificates
for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid and a check
payable to the holder in the amount of any cash amounts payable as the result of a conversion into fractional
shares of Common Stock, plus any declared and unpaid dividends on the converted Preferred Stock. Such
conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such
surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder
or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date; provided, however, that if the conversion is in
connection with an underwritten offer of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act or a merger, sale
or liquidation of the Corporation, the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering Preferred Stock
for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing of such transaction, in which event the person(s) entitled to
receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have
converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such transaction.

(d) Adjustments to Conversion Price for Diluting Issues.

(i) Special Definition. For purposes of this Section 4(d), “Additional Shares
of Common” shall mean all shares of Common Stock issued (or, pursuant to Section 4(d)(iii), deemed to be
issued) by the Corporation after the date of filing of this Third Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation (the “Filing Date”), other than:

the Securities Act;

(6) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable pursuant to the

lessors or other financial institutions pursuant to a debt financing or commercial leasing transaction approved

(9) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable to suppliers or third
party service providers in connection with the provision of goods or services pursuant to transactions
approved by the Board of Directors;

(ii) No Adjustment of Conversion Price. No adjustment in the Conversion Price
of a particular series of Preferred Stock shall be made in respect of the issuance of Additional Shares of
Common unless the consideration per share (as determined pursuant to Section 4(d)(v)) for an Additional
Share of Common issued or deemed to be issued by the Corporation is less than the Conversion Price in
effect on the date of, and immediately prior to such issue, for such series of Preferred Stock. .

(iii) Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Filing Date shall issue any Options or Convertible
Securities or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to
receive any such Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of shares (as set forth in the
instrument relating thereto without regard to any provisions contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of
such number) of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case of Convertible
Securities, the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities or, in the case of Options for
Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options and the conversion or exchange of the underlying
securities, shall be deemed to have been issued as of the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shall
have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, provided that in any such case in which
shares are deemed to be issued:

PALIB2_2883027_3 -7-
(1) no further adjustment in the Conversion Price of any series of
Preferred Stock shall be made upon the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities or shares of Common
Stock in connection with the exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities;

(2) if such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms provide,
with the passage of time or otherwise, for any change in the consideration payable to the Corporation or in
the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange thereof (other
than a change pursuant to the anti-dilution provisions of such Options or Convertible Securities such as this
Section 4(d) or pursuant to Recapitalization provisions of such Options or Convertible Securities such as
Sections 4(e), 4(f), 4(g) and 4(h) hereof), then upon such change the Conversion Price of each series of
Preferred Stock and any subsequent adjustments based thcreon shall be recomputed to reflect such change as
if such change had been in effect as of the original issuc thereof (or upon the occurrence of the record date
with respect thereto);

(3) no readjustment pursuant to clause (2) above shall have the effect of
increasing the Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock to an amount above the Conversion Price that
would have resulted from any other issuances of Additional Shares of Common and any other adjustments
provided for herein between the original adjustment date and such readjustment date;

(4) upon the expiration of any such Options or any rights of conversion
or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have been exercised, the Conversion Price of
each series of Preferred Stock computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record
date with respect thereto) and any subsequent adjustments based thereon shall, upon such expiration, be
recomputed as if:

(a) in the case of Convertible Securities or Options for Common
Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common issued were the shares of Common Stock, if any, actually
issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities and
the consideration received therefor was the consideration actually received by the Corporation for the issue
of such exercised Options plus the consideration actually received by the Corporation upon such exercise or
for the issue of all such Convertible Securities which were actually converted or exchanged, plus the
additional consideration, if any, actually received by the Corporation upon such conversion or exchange, and

(b) in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, only the ©
Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the cxercise thereof were issued at the time of issue of
such Options, and the consideration received by the Corporation for the Additional Shares of Common
deemed to have been then issucd was the consideration actually received by the Corporation for the issue of
such exercised Options, plus the consideration deemed to have been received by the Corporation (determined
pursuant to Section 4(d)(v)) upon the issue of the Convertible Securities with respect to which such Options
were actually exercised; and

(5) if such record date shall have been fixed and such Options or
Convertible Securities are not issued on the date fixed therefor, the adjustment previously made in the
Conversion Pricc which became effective on such record date shall be canceled as of the close of business on
such record date, and thereafter the Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this Section 4(d)(iii) as of
the actual date of their issuance.

PALIB2_2883027_3 -8-
(iv) Adjustment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional Shares of
Common. In the event this Corporation shall issue Additional Shares of Common (including Additional
Shares of Common deemed to be issued pursuant to Section 4(d)(iii)) without consideration or for a
consideration per share less than the applicable Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock in effect on
the date of and immediately prior to such issue, then, the Conversion Price of the affected series of Preferred
Stock shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest cent) determined by
' multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of shares which the aggregate
consideration received by the Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of Common so issued
would purchase at such Conversion Price, and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of such Additional Shares of
Common so issued. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Conversion Price shal] not be reduced at such time if
the amount of such reduction would be less than $0.01. For the purposes of this Subsection 4(d)(iv), all
shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock and the
exercise and/or conversion of any other outstanding Convertible Securities and all outstanding Options shall
be deemed to be outstanding. ,

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this subsection 4(d), the
consideration received by the Corporation for the issue (or deemed issue) of any Additional Shares of
Common shall be computed as follows:

Q) Cash and Property. Such consideration shall:

(a) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the aggregate’
amount of cash received by the Corporation after deducting any reasonable discounts, commissions or other
expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the Corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with
such issuance;

(b) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair market value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith by the Board
of Directors; and

{c) in the event Additional Shares of Common are issued
together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for consideration which covers
both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in clauses (a) and (b) above,
as reasonably determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(2) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per share
received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common deemed to have been issued pursuant to
Section 4(d)(iii) shall be determined by dividing

(x) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the
Corporation as consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the minimum
aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard
to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration) payable to the
Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securitics,
or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities
and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities by

PALJB2_2883027_3 -9.
(y) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set
forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent
adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of
such Convertible Securities.

(e) Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of Common Stock. In the event the
outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided (by stock split, by payment of a stock dividend or
otherwise), into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price of each series of
Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of

- such subdivision, be proportionately decreased. In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall

be combined (by reclassification or otherwise) into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, the
Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such combination shall,
concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination, be proportionately increased.

(f) Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of Preferred Stock. In the event the
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock or a series of Preferred Stock shall be subdivided (by stock split, by
payment of a stock dividend or otherwise); into a greater number of shares of Preferred Stock, the Dividend
Rate, Original Issue Price, Conversion Price and Liquidation Preference of the affected series of Preferred
Stock in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such
subdivision, be proportionately decreased. In the event the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock or a series
of Preferred Stock shall be combined (by reclassification or otherwise) into a lesser number of shares of
Preferred Stock, the Dividend Rate, Original Issue Price, Conversion Price and Liquidation Preference of the
affected series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such combination shall, concurrently with
the effectiveness of such combination, be proportionately increased.

(2) Adjustment for Other Distributions. In the event the Corporation at any time or from

_ time to time after the Filing Date makes or fixes a record date for the determination of holders ot Common

Stock entitled to receive any Distribution payable in securities of the Company or any other property, then
and in each such event provision shall be made so that the holders of Preferred Stock shall receive upon such
Distribution the amount of securities of the Corporation or other property which they would have received
had their Preferred Stock converted into Common Stock on the date of such event and had they thereafter,
during the period from the date of such event to and including the date of conversion, retained such securities
or other property receivable by them as aforesaid during such period, subject to all other adjustments called
