8

SV 2141603 +2

conversion may, at the option of the holder tendering shares of Preferred Stock for conversion, be
conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of the Corporation's securities
pursuant to such offering, in which event the holders making such elections who are entitled to
receive Common Stock upon conversion of their Preferred Stock shal] not be deemed to have
converted such shares of Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of the
Corporation’s securtties in the offering.

written consent of the holders of at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the then outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock (voting as a single class on an as converted to Common Stock basis) to

automatically without the need for any further action by the holders of such shares and whether
or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer
agent; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates
evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion unless the certificates
evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are either delivered to the Corporation or its transfer
agent as provided below, or the holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such
certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the
Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such
certificates. Upon the occurrence of such automatic conversion of the Preferred Stock, the
holders of Preferred Stock shal] surrender the certificates representing such shares at the office of
the Corporation or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock or Common Stock. As soon as
practicable thereafter, there shall be issued and delivered to such holder at such office and in its
name as shown on such surrendered certificate or certificates, a certificate or certificates for the
number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Preferred Stock surrendered were
convertible on the date on which such automatic conversion occurred.

5.3. Conversion Price. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible in
accordance with subsection 5.1 or subsection 5.2 above into the number of shares of Common
Stock which results from dividing the Original Issue Price for such serics of Preferred Stock by
the conversion price for such series of Preferred Stock that is in effect at the time of conversion
(the “Conversion Price”). The initial Conversion Price for cach such series of Preferred Stock
shall be the Original Issue Price for such series of Preferred Stock. The Conversion Price of cach
series of the Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided below.

9
SV 2141603 v2
Following each adjustment of the Conversion Price, such adjusted Conversion Price shall remain
in effect until a further adjustment of such Conversion Price hereunder.

5.4 Adjustment Upon Common Stock Event. Upon the happening of a
Common Stock Event (as hereinafter defined), the Conversion Price of each such series of

Preferred Stock shall, simultaneously with the happening of such Common Stock Event, be
adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock in effect
immediately prior to such Common Stock Event by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which shall be
the number of shares of Common Stack issued and outstanding immediately prior to such
Common Stock Event, and (ii) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately after such Common Stock Event, and the
product so obtained shall thereafter be the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock.

the happening of cach subsequent Common Stock Event. As used herein, the term the “Common
Stock Event’ shall mean at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date, (i) the
issue by the Corporation of additional shares of Common Stock as a dividend or other
distribution on outstanding Common Stock, (ii) a subdivision of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, or (iii) a combination of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock.

time to time after the Original Issue Date the Corporation pays a dividend or makes another

distribution to the holders of the Common Stock payable in securities of the Corporation, other
than an event constituting a Common Stock Event, then in each such event provision shall be
made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock shall receive upon conversion thereof, in addition
to the number of shares of Common Stock receivable upon conversion thereof, the amount of
securities of the Corporation which they would have been entitled to receive had their Preferred
Stock been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event (or such record date, as
applicable) and had they thereafter, during the period from the date of such event (or such record
date, as applicable) to and including the conversion date, retained such securities receivable by
them as aforesaid during such period, subject to all other adjustments called for during such
period under this Section 5 with respect to the nghts of the holders of the Preferred Stock or with
respect to such other securities by their terms; provided, however, that no such adjustment shall
be made if the holders of Preferred Stock simultaneously reccive a dividend or other distribution
of such securities. cash or other property in an amount equal to the amount of such securities as
they would have received if all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock had been converted into
Common Stock on the date of such event.

5.6 Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. If at any time
or from time to time after the Original Issue Date the Common Stock issuable upon the
conversion of the Preferred Stock is changed into the same or a different number of shares of any
class or classes of stock, whether by recapitalization, reclassification or otherwise (other than by
a Common Stock Event or a stock dividend, reorganization, merger, or consolidation provided
for elsewhere in this Section 5), then in any such event each holder of Preferred Stock shall have
the night thereafter to convert such stock into the kind and amount of stock and other securities
and property receivable upon such recapitalization, reclassification or other change by holders of
the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Preferred Stock could have

SV 2141603 v2 10
been converted immediately prior to such recapitalization, reclassification or change, all subject

terms thereof.

corporation (except an event which is governed under subsection 3.3), then, as a part of such
reorganization, merger or consolidation, provision shall be made so that the holders of the
Preferred Stock thereafter shall be entitled to receive, upon conversion of the Preferred Stock, the
number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the Corporation, or of such successor
corporation resulting from such reorganization, merger or consolidation, to which a holder of
Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock immediately prior to such
reorganization, merger or consolidation would have been entitled to receive on such
reorganization, merger or consolidation. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made
in the application of the provisions of this Section 5 with respect to the rights of the holders of
the Preferred Stock after the reorganization, merger or consolidation to the end that the
provisions of this Section 5 (including adjustment of the Conversion Price then in effect and
number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that
event and be as nearly equivalent to the provisions hereof as may be practicable. This subsection
5.7 shall similarly apply to successive reorganizations, mergers and consolidations.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5, if any reorganization,
merger or consolidation is approved by the vote of stockholders required by Section 6 hereof,
then such transaction and the rights of the holders of Preferred Stock and Common Stock
pursuant to such reorganization, merger or consolidation will be governed by the documents
entered into in connection with such transaction and not by the provisions of this Section 5.7.

5.8 Sale of Shares Below Conversion Price.

(a) Adjustment Formula. If at any time or from time to time after the
Original Issue Date the Corporation issues or sells, or is deemed by the provisions of this
subsection 5.8 to have issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock (as hereinafter
defined), otherwisc than in connection with a Common Stock Event as provided in subsection
5.4, a dividend or distribution as provided in subsection 5.5 or a recapitalization, reclassification
or other change as provided in subsection 5.6, or a reorganization, merger or consolidation as
provided in subsection 5.7, for an Effective Price (as hereinafter defined) that is less than the
Conversion Price for the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series A-2 Prefcrred Stock or Series A-3
Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such issue or sale (or deemed issue or sale), then,
and in each such case, the Conversion Price for such Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series A-2
Preferred Stock or Series A-3 Preferred Stock shall be reduced, as of the close of business on the
date of such issue or sale, to the price obtained by multiplying such Conversion Price by a
fraction:

(i) The numerator of which shall be the sum of (A) the number
of Common Stock Equivalents Outstanding (as hereinafter defined) immediately prior to
such issue or sale of Additional Shares of Common Stock plus (B) the quotient obtained

SV 2141603 v2 1
by dividing the Aggregate Consideration Received (as hereinafter defined) by the
Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued or
sold (or deemed so issued and sold) by the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred
Stock in effect immediately prior to such issue or sale; and

(ii) The denominator of which shali be the sum of (A) the
number of Common Stock Equivalents Outstanding immediately prior to such issue or
sale of Additional Shares of Common Stock plus (B) the number of Additional Shares of
Common Stock so issued or sold (or deemed so issued and sold),

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment to the Conversion Price of the Series A-3
Preferred Stock shall be made pursuant to this Section 5.8 with respect to any issuance or deemed
issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock that takes place prior to the date on which the
Corporation first issues any shares of Series A-3 Preferred Stock.

(b) Certain Definitions. For the purpose of making any adjustment
required under this subsection 5.8:

“Additional Shares of Common Stock” under this subparagraph 5.8(b).

(ii) The “Aggregate Consideration Received’ by the
Corporation for any issuc or sale (or deemed issue or sale) of securities shall (A) to the extent it
consists of cash, be computed at the gross amount of cash received by the Corporation before
deduction of any underwniting or similar commissions, compensation or concessions paid or

expenses payable by the Corporation, but excluding any amounts paid or payable for accrued
interest or accrued dividends: (B) to the extent it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair value of that property as determined in good faith by the Board; and (C) if
Additional Shares of Common Stock, Convertible Securities or Rights or Options to purchase

mean the number of shares of Common Stock that is equal to the sum of (A) all shares of

Stock: and

(vi) The “Rights or Options” shall mean warrants, options or

(c) Deemed Issuances. For the purpose of making any adjustment to
the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock required under this subsection 5.8, if the
Corporation issues or sells any Rights or Options or Convertible Securities and if the Effective
Price of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Rights or Options and/or the
conversion or exchange of Convertible Securities (computed without reference to any additional
or similar protective or antidilution clauses) is less than the Conversion Price then in effect for a
series of Preferred Stock, then the Corporation shall be deemed to have issued, at the time of the
issuance of such Rights, Options or Convertible Securities, that number of Additional Shares of

Options, the minimum amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Corporation upon the
exercise in full of such Rights or Options, plus, in the case of Convertible Securities, the
minimum amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Corporation (other than by
cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities) upon the
conversion or exchange thereof: provided that:

(i) if the minimum amounts of such consideration cannot be

shall be deemed to have received the minimum amounts of consideration without reference to
such clauses;

(ii) if the minimum amount of consideration payable to the
Corporation upon the exercise of Rights or Options or the conversion or exchange of Convertible

other than by reason of antidilution adjustments, then the Effective Price shall be recalculated
using the figure to which such minimum amount of consideration is reduced; and

(iii) if the minimum amount of consideration payable to the
Corporation upon the exercise of such Rights or Options or the conversion or exchange of
Convertible Securities is subsequently increased, then the Effective Price shall again be
recalculated using the increased minimum amount of consideration payable to the Corporation
upon the exercise of such Rights or Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities.

No further adjustment of the Conversion Price, adjusted upon the issuance of such Rights or
Options or Convertible Securities, shall be made as a result of the actual issuance of shares of
Common Stock on the exercise of any such Rights or Options or the conversion or exchange of
any such Convertible Securities. If any such Rights or Options or the conversion rights
tepresented by any such Convertible Sccurities shall expire without having been fully exercised,

SV 2141603 v2 14
then the Conversion Price as adjusted upon the issuance of such Rights or Options or Convertible
Securities shall be readjusted to the Conversion Price which would have been in effect had an
adjustment been made on the basis thal the only shares of Common Stock so issued were thc
shares of Common Stock, if any, that were actually issued or sold on the exercise of such Rights

Common Stock, if any, were issued or sold for the consideration actually received by the
Corporation upon such exercise, plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the
Corporation for the granting of all such Rights or Options, whether or not exerciscd, plus the
consideration received for issuing or selling all such Convertible Securities actually converted or

mail, postage prepaid, to each registered holder of the Preferred Stock at the holder’s address as
shown in the Corporation's books.

5.10 Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued
upon any conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional share to which the holder

such fraction multiplied by the Common Stock’s fair market value as determined in good faith by
the Board as of the date of conversion.

5.11 Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at
all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock,

solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock, such
number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to cffect the
conversion of all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion

shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.

7. Redemption

7A Mandatory Redemption of Preferred Stock. On-or after the date that is five
years after the date on which the first share of Series A-3 Preferred Stock is issucd by the

(collectively, the “Redeemable Preferred’), voting together as a single class, the Redeemable
Preferred may require the Corporation to redeem, on the terms and conditions stated herein, out
of funds legally available therefor, all of the Redeemable Preferred in three equal annual
installments, commencing sixty (GO) days after receipt by the Corporation of written notice of
such elcction of the Redeemable Preferred(the date of each installment shall be referred to herein
as a “Redemption Date,” the first of which is referred to herein as the “Initial Redemption
Date’). On each Redemption Date, the Corporation shall redeem thirty-three and one third
percent (33 1/3%) of the total Preferred Stock being redeemed, rounded downward to the nearest
whole share for the first two such Redemption Dates, and for the balance of the Preferred Stock
in the third Redemption Date. The second and third Redemption Dates will be twelve (12)
months and twenty-four (24) months, respectively, after the Initial Redemption Date. The
Corporation will effect such redemptions by paying in cash in exchange for each series of
Preferred Stock the Original Issue Price of each such relevant series. All declarcd but unpaid
dividends shall be paid concurrently with any redemption. The Corporation shall effect such
redemption out of funds that are, or through the reasonable cfforts of the Corporation can be
made, legally available for such purposes, in priority to any other scheduled or pending
redemption or distribution.

days prior to cach Redemption Date, written notice shall be mailed, first class postage paid, to
each holder of record (at the close of business on the business day preceding the day on which

records of the Corporation for such holder, notifying such holder of the redemption to be
effected, specifying the number of shares to be redeemed from such holder, the Redemption
Date, the Original Issue Prices, the place at which payment may bc obtained and calling upon
such holder to surrender to the Corporation, in the manner and at the place designated, the
certificate or certificates representing the shares to be redeemed (the “Redemption Notice”).
Except as provided in Section 7.3, on or after the Redemption Date, each holder of Redeemable
Preferred to be redcemed shall surrender to this Corporation the certificate or certificates
representing such shares, in the manner and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice,
and thereupon the Redemption Prices of such shares shall be payable to the order of the person
whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof and each surrendered
certificate shall be canceled. In the event less than all the shares represented by any such
certificate are redecmed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares as

interest upon surrender of their certificate or certificates) shall ceasc with respect to such shares,
and such shares shall not thereafter be transferred on the books of the Corporation or be deemed

to be outstanding for any purpose whatsoever. If the funds of the Corporation legally available
for the redemption of shares of Redeemable Preferred on any Redemption Date are insufficient to
redeem the total number of shares of Redeemable Preferred to be redeemed on such date, those
funds which are legally available will be used to redeem the maximum possible number of shares
ratably among the holders of such shares to be redeemed based on thcir holdings of Redeemable
Preferred. The sharcs of Redeemable Preferred not redecmed shall remain outstanding and
entitled to all the rights and preferences provided herein. At any time thereafter when additional

Corporation has become obliged to redecm on any Redemption Date, but which it has not
redeemed.

capital and surplus in excess of $100,000,000 as a trust fund for the benefit of the respective
holders of the. shares designated for redemption and not yet redeemed, with irrevocable
instructions and authority to the bank or trust corporation to pay the Redemption Prices for such
shares to their respective holders on or after the Redemption Date upon receipt of notification
from the Corporation that such holder has surrendered his share certificate to the Corporation
pursuant to Section 7.3 above. As of the date of such deposit (even if prior to the Redemption
Date), the deposit shall constitute full payment of the shares to their holders, and from and after
the date of the deposit the shares do called for redemption shall be redeemed and shal] be deemed
to be no longer outstanding, and the holders thereof shall cease to be stockholders with respect to
such shares and shall have no rights with respect thereto except the right to receive from the bank
or trust corporation payment of the Original Issue Price of the shares, without interest, upon
surrender of their certificates therefor and the right to convert such shares as provided in Section
5. Such instructions shal! also provide that any moneys deposited by the Corporation pursuant to
this section for the redemption of shares thereafter converted into shares of thc Corporations’
Common Stock pursuant to Section 5 hereof prior to the Redemption Date shall be returned to
the Corporation forthwith upon such conversion. The balance of any moneys deposited by the
Corporation pursuant to this section remaining unclaimed at the expiration of two (2) vears
following the Redemption Date shall thereafter be returned to the Corporation upon its request
expressed in a resolution of its Board of Directors.

issue and deliver to such holder, at the place designated by such holder, a certificate or
certificates for the number of full shares of the Series A-1-A or Series A-2-A Preferred Stock to
