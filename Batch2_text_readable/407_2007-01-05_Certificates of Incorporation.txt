(other than a stock dividend payable solely in Common Stock) payable upon the then outstanding
shares of the Common Stock, the Board of Directors shall declare at the same time (i) a dividend
upon each outstanding share of the Series A Preferred, payable at the same time as the dividend paid
on the Common Stock, in an amount per share of the Series A Preferred equal to the amount
payable on the shares of the Common Stock into which each share of the Series A Preferred could
then be converted, (ii) a dividend upon each outstanding share of the Series A-1 Preferred, payable
at the same time as the dividend paid on the Common Stock, in an amount per share of the Series A-

dividend upon each outstanding share of the Series C Preferred, payable at the same time as the

amount payable on the shares of the Common Stock into which each share of the Series C Preferred
would then be converted. No dividend shall be payable on the shares of Series A Preferred, Series
A-1 Preferred, Series B Preferred or Common Stock unless an equivalent per share dividend is
payable on the shares of Series C Preferred on the same date fixed for payment of any such dividend
on the Series A Preferred, Series A-1 Preferred, Scries B Preferred or Common Stock. No dividend
shall be payable on the shares of Series A Preferred, Series A-1 Preferred or Common Stock unless
an equivalent per share dividend is payable on the shares of Series B Preferred on the same date
fixed for payment of any such dividend on the Series A Preferred, Series A-1 Preferred or Common
Stock. No dividend shall be payable on the shares of Series A Preferred unless an equivalent per
share dividend is payable on the shares of Series A-1 Preferred on the same date fixed for payment
of the corresponding dividend on the Series A Preferred. No dividend shall be payable on the
shares of Series A-1 Preferred unless an equivalent per share dividend is payable on the shares

Series A Preferred on the same date fixed for payment of the corresponding dividend on the Series
A-1 Preferred.

2. Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding-Up.

(a) In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation (a
“Liquidation Event’), whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of shares of the Series C
Preferred then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Corporation available
for distribution to its stockholders (after payment or provision for payment of all debts and liabilities
of the Corporation), before any payment shall be made to the holders of the Series A-1 Preferred,
Series A Preferred, Senes B Preferred or Common Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, an
amount equal to the Series C Original Issue Price (subject to equitable adjustment in the event of
any stock dividend, stock split, combination, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, or
other similar event affecting the shares of Series C Preferred effected subsequent to the filing of this
Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Effective Time”’)) plus any declared but unpaid
dividends. For all purposes of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the “Series C Original
Issue Price” shall mean $1.8293 per share of Series C Preferred; provided, however, that if any
shares of Series C Preferred are issued and sold after the date hereof in one or more issuances at a

-3-
price per share less than $1.8293, then the Original Series C Issue Price shall be reduced to equal the
lowest price per share of Series C Preferred sold in all issuances of Series C Preferred subsequent to
the date on which the Series C Preferred are first issued.

(b) Lf upon such Liquidation Event, the assets to be distributed to the Corporation’s
stockholders are insufficient to permit the payment in full to the holders of the Series C Preferred of
all] amounts distributable to them under Section B2(a) hereof, then the entire assets of the
Corporation available for such distribution shall be distributed ratably among the holders of the
Series C Preferred in proportion to the amount of such stock owned by each such holder.

(c) After the payment to the holders of the Series C Preferred of the full preferential
amount distributable to such holders under Section B2(a) hereof, if the assets available for
distribution to the Corporation’s stockholders (after payment or provision for payment of all debts
and liabilities of the Corporation) exceed the amount distributable to the holders of the Series C
Preferred under Section B2(a) hereof, the holders of shares of the Series B Preferred then
outstanding shall be entitled to be paid out of such excess amount (such excess amount, the “Series
B Excess Amount”), if any, before any payment shall be made to the holders of the Series A-1
Preferred, Series A Preferred or Common Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount
equal to the Series B Orginal Issue Price (subject to equitable adjustment in the event of any stock
dividend, stock split, combination, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, or other similar
event affecting the shares of Series B Preferred effected subsequent to the Effective Time) plus any
declared but unpaid dividends. For all purposes of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the
“Series B Original Issue Price” shall mean $1.4124 per share of Series B Preferred; provided,
however, that if any Series B Preferred are issued and sold after the date on which the Series B
Preferred are first issued in one or more issuances at a price per share less than $1.4124, then the
Original Series B Issue Price shall be reduced to equal the lowest price per share of Series B
Preferred sold in all issuances of Series B Preferred subsequent to the date on which the Series B
Preferred are first issued.

(d) If upon such Liquidation Event, the Series B Excess Amount is insufficient to permit
the payment in full to the holders of the Series B Preferred of all amounts distributable to them
under Section B2(c) hereof, then the entire Series B Excess Amount shall be distributed ratably

among the holders of the Series B Preferred in proportion to the amount of such stock owned by
each such holder.

(e) After the payment to the holders of the Series C Preferred and Series B Preferred of
the full preferential amount distributable to such holders under Sections B2(a) hereof and B2(c)
hereof, if the assets available for distribution to the Corporation’s stockholders (after payment or
provision for payment of all debts and liabilities of the Corporation) exceed the amount distributable
to the holders of the Series C Preferred under Section B2(a) hereof and the amount distributable to
the holders of the Series B Preferred under Section B2(c) hereof, the holders of shares of the Series
A-1 Preferred then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid out of such excess amount (such excess
amount, the “Series A-1 Excess Amount”), if any, before any payment shall be made to the holders
of the Series A Preferred or Common Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount equal
to $6.8057 per share (subject to equitable adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split,
combination, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, or other similar event affecting the

shares of Series A-1 Preferred effected subsequent to the Effective Time) plus any declared but
unpaid dividends.
(f) If upon such Liquidation Event, the Series A-1 Excess Amount is insufficient to
permit the payment in full to the holders of the Series A-1 Preferred of all amounts distributable to
them under Section B2(e) hereof, then the entire Series A-1 Excess Amount shall be distributed
ratably among the holders of the Series A-1 Preferred in proportion to the amount of such stock
owned by each such holder.

(g) After the payment to the holders of the Series C Preferred, Series B Preferred and
Series A-1 Preferred of their full respective preferential amounts distributable to such holders under
Sections B2(a), (c) and (e) hereof, if the assets available for distribution to the Corporation’s
stockholders (after payment or provision for payment of all debts and liabilities of the Corporation)
exceed the amount distributable to the holders of the Series C Preferred under Section B2(a) hereof,
the amount distributable to the holders of the Series B Preferred under Section B2(c) hereof and the
amount distributable to the holders of the Series A-1 Preferred under Section B2(e) hereof, the
holders of shares of the Series A Preferred then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid out of such
excess amount (such excess amount, the “Series A Excess Amount’), if any, before any payment
shall be made to the holders of the Common Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount
equal to $26.8161 per share (subject to equitable adjustment in the event of any stock dividend,
stock split, combination, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, or other similar event
affecting the shares of Series A Preferred effected subsequent to the Effective Time) plus any
declared but unpaid dividends.

(h) If upon such Liquidation Event, the Series A Excess Amount is insufficient to permit
the payment in full to the holders of the Series A Preferred of all amounts distributable to them
under Section B2(g) hereof, then the entire remaining Series A Excess Amount shall be distributed
ratably among the holders of the Series A Preferred in proportion to the amount of such stock
owned by each such holder.

(a) After payment has been made in full pursuant to Sections B2(a), B2(c), B2(e) and
B2(g) above, the remaining assets available for distribution (after payment or provision for payment
of all debts and liabilities of the Corporation) shall be distributed pro rata (on an as-if converted
basis) to the holders of Common Stock, Series C Preferred, Series B Preferred, Series A-1 Preferred
and Series A Preferred, based on the number of shares of Common Stock held by each such holder
and the number of shares of Common Stock into which such holder’s shares of Series C Preferred,
Series B Preferred, Series A-1 Preferred or Series A Preferred are then convertible.

(j) A “Liquidation Event” shall be deemed to be occasioned by, or to include, (i) the
acquisition of the Corporation by means of any transaction or series of related transactions
(including, without limitation, any reorganization, merger or consolidation with or into any other
entity) that results in the holders of the outstanding voting securities of the Corporation as
constituted immediately prior to such transaction, holding less than fifty percent (50%) of the
outstanding voting securities of the Corporation or the surviving or acquiring entity immediately
following such transaction; or (ii) the sale, license, lease, assignment, transfer or other conveyance
of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation in a single transaction or a series of related
transactions, and in the case of either (i) or (ii) shall entitle the holders of Preferred Stock to receive
at the closing (or such later date as the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding Series C
Preferred, Series B Preferred, Series A-1 Preferred and Series A Preferred, voting together as a
single class on an as converted basis, shall determine) in cash, securities or other property (valued as
provided in Section B2(k) below) amounts as specified in Sections B2(a) through B2(i), inclusive,
above. The provisions of this Section B2(j) shall not apply to any reorganization, merger or

-5-
consolidation involving (1) only a change in the state of incorporation of the Corporation or (2) a
merger of the Corporation with or into a wholly owned subsidiary of the Corporation that is
incorporated in the United States of America.

(k) Distributions Other than Cash. Whenever the distribution provided for in this
Section B2 shall be payable in property other than cash, the value of such distribution shall be the
fair market value as follows:

(i) If traded on a securities exchange or quoted on the Nasdaq Global Market,
the Nasdaq National Market or the Nasdaq SmallCap Market, the value shall be deemed
to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange or system over
the thirty (30) calendar day period ending three (3) calendar days prior to, but not
including, the closing;

(ii) ‘If actively (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) traded
over-the-counter but not on the Nasdaq Global Market, the Nasdaq National Market or
the Nasdaq SmallCap Market, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing
bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the thirty (30) calendar day period
ending three (3) calendar days prior to, but not including, the closing;

(ii) If Subsections B2(k){i) and B2(k)(ii) do not apply, the value shall be the
fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors with the
concurrence of the member of the Board of Directors elected by the Series C Preferred,
Series B Preferred, Series A-1 Preferred and Series A Preferred; and

(iv) The value of any securities that are subject to restrictions on free
marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of a stockholder’s status as
an affiliate or former affiliate) shall include an appropriate discount from the market
value determined pursuant to Subsections B(2)(k)(i) or B(2)(k)(ii) above to reflect the
approximate fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors with the concurrence of the member of the Board of Directors elected by the
Series C Preferred, Series B Preferred, Series A-1 Preferred, and Series A Preferred.

3. Voting.

(a) Voting Rights. Except as otherwise required by law, or as provided in Section B8
hereof, each holder of shares of the Series C Preferred, the Series B Preferred, the Series A-1
Preferred and the Series A Preferred shall be entitled to notice of any stockholders’ meeting, to vote
on all matters on which the Common Stock may be voted and shall be entitled to a number of votes
equal to the number of whole shares of Common Stock into which such holder’s shares of Preferred
Stock are then convertible (as adjusted from time to time in the manner set forth herein). Fractional
votes shall not, however, be permitted and any fractional votes resulting from the above formula
(after aggregating all shares into which shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder could be
converted), shall be disregarded. Except as otherwise required by law or as expressly provided in
this Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of shares of the Series C Preferred, the Series
B Preferred, the Series A-1 Preferred and the Series A Preferred shall vote together with the
Common Stock as a single class on all matters submitted to stockholders for a vote.
(b) Election of Directors. The holders of at least a majority of the Series C Preferred,
the Series B Preferred, the Series A-1 Preferred and the Series A Preferred outstanding, voting
together as a single class, shall be entitled to elect one (1) director. The holders of at least a majority
of the Common Stock outstanding, voting separately as a single class, shall be entitled to elect two
(2) directors. The remaining members of the Board of Directors shall be elected by the holders of at
least a majority of the Common Stock and the Preferred Stock outstanding, voting together as a
single class on an as-converted basis. There shall be no cumulative voting.

4. Conversion of Preferred Stock. The holders of Series C Preferred, Series B
Preferred, Series A-1 Preferred and Series A Preferred shall have conversion rights as follows (the
“Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert; Conversion Price. Each share of Series C Preferred shall be
convertible, without the payment of any additional consideration by the holder thereof and at the
option of the holder thereof, at any time and from time to time after the date of issuance of such
share, at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, into such
number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of the Common Stock as is determined by dividing
the Series C Original Issue Price (as subject to further adjustment pursuant to Section B2(a)) by the
Series C Conversion Price determined as hereinafter provided, in effect at the time of conversion.
The Series C Conversion Price, for purposes of calculating the number of shares of Common Stock
deliverable upon conversion of the Series C Preferred, shall initially be equal to the Series C
Original Issue Price, as subject to further adjustment pursuant to both Section B2(a) and the
provisions of Section B4(e), as applicable. Each share of Series B Preferred, Series A-1 Preferred
and Series A Preferred shall be convertible, without the payment of any additional consideration by
the holder thereof and at the option of the holder thereof, at any time and from time to time after the
date of issuance of such share, at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for the Preferred
Stock, into such number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of the Common Stock as is
determined by dividing the Series B Original Issue Price (as subject to further adjustment pursuant
to Section B2(c)) by the Series B Conversion Price, the Series A-1 Conversion Price and the Series
A Conversion Price, as applicable, determined as hereinafter provided, in effect at the time of
conversion. The Series B Conversion Price, for purposes of calculating the number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of the Series B Preferred, shall initially be equal to the
Series B Onginal Issue Price, as subject to further adjustment pursuant to both Section B2(c) and
the provisions of Section B4(e), as applicable. The Series A-1 Conversion Price, for purposes of
calculating the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of the Series A-1
Preferred, shall initially be equal to the Series B Original Issue Price, as subject to further
adjustment pursuant to both Section B2(c) and the provisions of Section B4(e), as applicable. The
Series A Conversion Price, for purposes of calculating the number of shares of Common Stock
deliverable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred, shall initially be equal to the Series B
Original Issue Price, as subject to further adjustment pursuant to both Section B2(c) and the
provisions of Section B4(e), as applicable. The Series C Conversion Price, the Series B Conversion
Price, the Series A-1 Conversion Price and the Series A Conversion Price are hereinafter sometimes
collectively referred to as the “Series C, B, A-1 and A Conversion Prices”. In the case of a
Liquidation Event, the conversion rights shall terminate at the close of business on the first full day

preceding the date fixed for the payment of any amounts distributable on liquidation to the holders
of the Preferred Stock.
(b) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of shares of any series of Preferred
Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into shares of the Common Stock, such holder shall
surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed or with stock powers attached, at the
office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for such series, and shall give written notice to the
Corporation at such office that such holder elects to convert the same and shall state therein the
name of such holder or the name or names of the nominees of such holder in which such holder
wishes the certificate or certificates for whole shares of the Common Stock to be issued.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if, upon conversion of the aggregate number of
shares of Preferred Stock to be converted by any holder, such holder would receive a fractional
share of the Common Stock, in lieu of any fractional share of the Common Stock to which the
holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied
by the then fair market value per share of the Common Stock as determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors of the Corporation. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter,
issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to such holder's nominee or
nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of whole shares of the Common Stock to
which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid, together with cash in lieu of any fraction of a share.
Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on
the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or
persons entitled to receive the whole shares of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion shall be
treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such whole number of shares of the
Common Stock on such date. The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and transfer taxes that
may be payable in respect of the issuance and delivery to any holder of Preferred Stock of whole
shares of the Common Stock upon conversion of one or more shares of such holder’s Preferred
Stock. If the conversion is in connection with an underwritten offering of securities registered
pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering
shares of Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters
of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering, in which event the persons entitled to receive
the Common Stock upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have

converted such shares of Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of
securities.

(c) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Series C Preferred shall automatically be
converted into shares of Common Stock at the then effective Series C Conversion Price, each share
of Series B Preferred shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the then
effective Series B Conversion Price, each share of Series A-1 Preferred shall automatically be
converted into shares of Common Stock at the then effective Series A-1 Conversion Price and each
share of Series A Preferred shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the

then effective Series A Conversion Price, upon the first to occur of the following (each, an
“Automatic Conversion Event”):

(A) _ the closing of a firm commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to
an effective registration statement on Form S-1 (as defined in the Securities Act) or any
successor form under the Secuntties Act of 1933, as amended, covering the offer and sale
of Common Stock for the account of the Corporation to the public at an initial public
offering price per share (before deducting underwriters’ commissions, discounts and
expenses) that is not less than seven times (7x) the Series C Original Issue Price (as
subject to further adjustment pursuant to Section B2(a) and subject to equitable
adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination, reorganization,

-8-
recapitalization, reclassification, or other similar event affecting the shares of Series C
Preferred) and with gross proceeds to the Corporation of not less than $30,000,000
(before deducting underwriters’ commissions, discounts and expenses) (a ‘Qualified
Public Offering”); or

(B) _ the approval of holders of not less than a majority of the outstanding
shares of Series C Preferred, Series B Preferred, Series A-1 Preferred and Series A
Preferred (voting together as a single class and not as separate series, and on an as-
converted to Common Stock basis) that all shares of Series C Preferred, Series B
Preferred, Series A-1 Preferred and Series A Preferred be automatically converted.

Upon the occurrence of an Automatic Conversion Event, all shares of Preferred Stock shall
be converted automatically without any further action by any holder of such shares and whether or
not the certificate or certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or the
applicable transfer agent, provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue a
certificate or certificates evidencing the whole number of shares of Common Stock into which such
shares of Preferred Stock were converted unless the certificate or certificates previously
representing such shares of Preferred Stock are either delivered to the Corporation or the applicable
transfer agent, or the holder notifies the Corporation or such transfer agent that such certificate or
certificates have been lost, stolen, or destroyed and executes and delivers an agreement satisfactory
to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection
therewith. The Corporation shall give each holder of shares of Preferred Stock written notice of the
automatic conversion date and the place designated for such conversion. Upon the automatic
conversion of the Preferred Stock, each holder of Preferred Stock shall surrender the certificate or
certificates representing such holder's shares of Preferred Stock at the office of the Corporation or of
the applicable transfer agent. Thereupon, there shall be issued and delivered to such holder,
promptly at such office and in such holder’s name as shown on such surrendered certificate or
certificates, a certificate or certificates for the whole number of shares of Common Stock into which
the shares of Preferred Stock surrendered were converted on the date on which such automatic
conversion occurred. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon the automatic
conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares of Common Stock to which the
holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied
by the fair market value per share of the Common Stock (determined as set forth in Section B4(b)
above). Each stock certificate that, immediately prior to the Automatic Conversion Event,
represented shares of Preferred Stock shall, from and after the Automatic Conversion Event,
automatically and without necessity of presenting the same for exchange, represent that whole
number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Preferred Stock represented by such

certificate shall have been converted (as well as the right to receive cash in lieu of any fractional
share of Common Stock).

(d) Termination of Rights upon Conversion. All shares of Preferred Stock converted as
herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights with respect to such
shares under this Section B, including the rights, if any, to receive notices, to vote and to accrual of
dividends as holders of Preferred Stock shall immediately cease and terminate upon such
conversion (except only the right of the holders thereof to receive shares of the Common Stock and

cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Preferred Stock in exchange therefor pursuant to the terms
hereof).
(e) Adjustments to Conversion Prices for Dilutive Issuances.

Incorporation, the following definitions shall apply:

the passage of time or otherwise, for any increase or decrease in the consideration
payable to the Corporation, or any increase or decrease in the number of shares of
the Common Stock issuable, upon the exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, the
Series C, B, A-1 and A Conversion Prices computed upon the original issue thereof
(or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent
adjustments based thereon, shall, upon any such increase or decrease becoming
effective, be recomputed to reflect such increase or decrease insofar as it affects such

exercise, or for the issue of all such Convertible Securities which were
actually converted or exchanged, plus the additional consideration, if any,

event is dealt with in Subsection B4(e)(vii), without consideration or for a consideration
per share less than the Series C Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such
issue, then and in such event, the Series C Conversion Price shall be reduced,
concurrently with such issue in order to increase the number of shares of Common Stock
into which a share of Series C Preferred is convertible, to a price (calculated to the
nearest one hundred thousandth of a cent) determined by multiplying the Series C
Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issue or sale by a fraction (x) the
numerator of which shall be (A) the number of shares of Common Stock Deemed
Outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale plus (B) the number of shares of the
Common Stock which the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for the
total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued would purchase at the
Series C Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issue or sale and (y) the
denominator of which shall be (A) the number of shares of the Common Stock Deemed

Shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to Subsection B4(e)(iv), which event is dealt
with in Subsection B4(e)(vii), without consideration or for a consideration per share less
than the Series B Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issue, then and in

-15-
such event, the Series B Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue
in order to increase the number of shares of Common Stock into which a share of Series
B Preferred is convertible, to a price (calculated to the nearest one hundred thousandth of
a cent) determined by multiplying the Series B Conversion Price in effect immediately
prior to such issue or sale by a fraction (x) the numerator of which shall be (A) the
number of shares of Common Stock Deemed Outstanding immediately prior to such issue
or sale plus (B) the number of shares of the Common Stock which the aggregate
consideration received by the Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of
Common Stock so issued would purchase at the Series B Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such issue or sale and (y) the denominator of which shall be (A) the
number of shares of the Common Stock Deemed Outstanding immediately prior to such
issue or sale plus (B) the number of such Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued
or sold or deemed to be issued or sold, provided that the Series B Conversion Price shall
not be so reduced at such time if the amount of such reduction would be an amount less
than one hundred thousandth of a cent, but any such amount shall be carried forward and
reduction with respect thereto shall be made at the time of and together with any

Additional Shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to Subsection B4(e)(iv), which
event is dealt with in Subsection B4(e)(vii), without consideration or for a consideration
per share less than the Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such
issue, then and in such event, the Series A Conversion Price shall be reduced,
concurrently with such issue in order to increase the number of shares of Common Stock
into which a share of Series A Preferred is convertible, to a price (calculated to the
nearest one hundred thousandth of a cent) determined by multiplying the Series A
Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issue or sale by a fraction (x) the
numerator of which shall be (A) the number of shares of Common Stock Deemed
Outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale plus (B) the number of shares of the
Common Stock which the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for the
total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued would purchase at the
Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issue or sale and (y) the

issue, then and in such event, the Series A-1 Conversion Price shall be reduced,
concurrently with such issue in order to increase the number of shares of Common Stock
into which a share of Series A Preferred is convertible, to a price (calculated to the
nearest one hundred thousandth of a cent) determined by multiplying the Series A-1
Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issue or sale by a fraction (x) the
numerator of which shall be (A) the number of shares of Common Stock Deemed
Outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale plus (B) the number of shares of the
Common Stock which the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for the
total number of Additional Shares of Common stock so issued would purchase at the
Series A-1 Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issue or sale and (y) the

(A) _ Insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the aggregate of
cash received by the Corporation, excluding amounts paid or payable for
accrued interest or accrued dividends;

(B) Insofar as it consists of property (other than cash) or services,
be computed at the fair market value thereof at the time of such issue, as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors with the concurrence of
the member of the Board of Directors elected by the Series C Preferred,
Series B Preferred, Series A-1 Preferred and Series A Preferred; and

(C) _ In the event Additional Shares of Common Stock are issued

together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for
consideration which covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so

-17-
received, computed as provided in Subsections B4(e)(vi)(1)(A) and
B4(e)(vi)(1)(B) above, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors
with the concurrence of the member of the Board of Directors elected by the
Series B C Preferred, Series B Preferred, Series A-1 Preferred and Series A
Preferred.

(2) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per share
received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to
have been issued pursuant to Subsection B4(eYili), relating to Options and
Convertible Securities, shall be determined by dividing (A) the total amount, if any,
received or receivable by the Corporation as consideration for the issue of such
Options or Convertible Securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional
consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any
provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration)
payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible
Securities, the exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities and the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, by (B) the maximum number
of shares of the Common Stock (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto,

such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities.

(vii) Adjustment for Stock Splits, Stock Dividends, Subdivisions,
Combinations or Consolidation of Common Stock. In the event that at any time or from
time to time after the Series C Original Issue Date, (1) the outstanding shares of the
Common Stock shall be split, subdivided, combined or consolidated, by reclassification
or otherwise, into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, or (2) the
Corporation shall issue shares of the Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities
by way of a stock dividend or other distribution to the holders of the Common Stock, the
Series C, B, A-1 and A Conversion Prices in effect immediately prior to such split,
subdivision, stock dividend, distribution, combination or consolidation shall, concurrently
with the effectiveness of such split, subdivision, combination or consolidation or, as
applicable, the record date of such stock dividend or distribution, be increased or
decreased proportionately so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on
conversion of each share of such series shall be increased or decreased in proportion to
such increase or decrease in the Common Stock Deemed Outstanding upon effectuation
of such split, subdivision, stock dividend, distribution, combination or consolidation
(with the number of shares issuable with respect to Options or Convertible Securities

determined from time to time in the manner provided for deemed issuances in
Subsection B4(e)(iii). _

(viii) Capital Reorganization or Merger. If at any time or from time to time
after the Series C Original Issue Date there shall be a capital reorganization of the
Common Stock (other than a stock dividend, distribution, split, subdivision, combination,
consolidation or reclassification of shares provided for in Subsections B4(e)(vii)) or a
consolidation or merger of the Corporation in which the holders of the outstanding voting

-18-
securities of the Corporation as constituted immediately prior to such transaction,
continue to hold at least fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding voting securities of the
Corporation or the surviving or acquiring entity immediately following such transaction
(any such reorganization, consolidation or merger, a “Reorganization”), then, as a part of
and as a condition to such Reorganization, provision shall be made so that the holders of
the outstanding shares of any series of Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to
receive upon conversion of the shares of such series the same kind and amount of stock
or other securities or property (including cash) of the Corporation, or of the successor
corporation resulting from such Reorganization, to which such holder would have been
entitled if such holder had converted its shares of such series of Preferred Stock
immediately prior to the effective time of such Reorganization. In any such case,
appropriate adjustment shal] be made in the application of the provisions of this Section
B4 to the end that the provisions of this Section B4 (including adjustment of the Series C,
B, A-1 and A Conversion Prices then in effect and the number of shares of Common
Stock or other securities issuable upon conversion of the shares of such series of
Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after such Reorganization in as nearly equivalent
manner as may be reasonably practicable.

(f) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Series C Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series A-1 Conversion
Price or Series A Conversion Price pursuant to this Section B4, the Corporation at its expense shall
compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to each
affected holder of Preferred Stock a certificate executed by the Corporation’s Chief Executive
Officer or Chief Financial Officer setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in
detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon
the written request at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished
to such holder a like certificate setting forth (A) such adjustment and readjustment, (B) the
Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock at the time in effect, and (C) the number of
shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property that at the time would be
received upon the conversion of a share of Preferred Stock.

(g) | No Impairment. The Corporation will not, by amendment of this Restated
Certificate of Incorporation or through any reorganization, recapitalization, transfer of assets,
consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or
seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed
hereunder by the Corporation but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the
provisions of this Section B4 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate

in order to protect the conversion rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock against impairment to
the extent provided in this Section B4.

(h) Other Distributions. In the event that the Corporation shall declare a distribution on
its Common Stock payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by the
Corporation or other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred to in
subsection B(e)vii), then, in each such case, for the purpose of this subsection B4(h), the holders of
the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any such distribution as though they
were the holders of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation into which their
shares of Preferred Stock are convertible as of the record date fixed for the determination of the
holders of Common Stock of the Corporation entitled to receive such distribution.

them to receive any dividend or other distribution, or to receive any right to subscribe for or
purchase any shares of stock of any class or any other securities, or to receive any other right;

(b) Of any capital reorganization of the Corporation, any reclassification of the

property), or any transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation;

(c) Of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the
Corporation; or

(d) Of any other act or transaction requiring the approval of holders of the Series C

the Preferred Stock a notice specifying, as the case may be, (1) the record date for such dividend,
distribution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right, or (2) the
effective date on which such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer,
dissolution, liquidation, winding-up, act or transaction is to take place, and the time, if any is to be
fixed, as of which the holders of record of Common Stock (or such other stock or securities at the
time issuable upon the conversion of the Series C Preferred, the Series B Preferred, the Series A-1
Preferred or the Series A Preferred) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock (or
such other stock or securities) for securities or other property deliverable upon such reorganization,

its authorized but unissued Common Stock such number of shares of Common Stock as shall from
time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock and if
at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient
to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take
such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized
but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such
purpose, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder
approval of any necessary amendment to this Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

7. Reacquired Shares. Any shares of Preferred Stock converted, redeemed, purchased,
or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever shall, automatically and
without further action, be retired and canceled promptly after the acquisition thereof, and shall not
be reissued and the Corporation from time to time shall take such action as may be necessary to

reduce the number of authorized shares of the Series C Preferred, the Series B Preferred, the Series
A-1 Preferred and the Series A Preferred accordingly.

FIFTH: The Corporation is to have perpetual existence.
SIXTH: For the management of the business and for the conduct of the affairs of the

Corporation, and in further definition and not in limitation of the powers of the Corporation and of
its directors and of its stockholders or any class thereof, as the case may be, conferred by the State
of Delaware, it is further provided that:

(a) The management of the business and the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation
shall be vested in its Board of Directors. The number of directors which shall constitute the whole
Board of Directors shall be fixed by, or in the manner provided in, the By-Laws. The phrase
“whole Board” and the phrase “total number of directors” shall be deemed to have the same
meaning, to wit, the total number of directors which the Corporation would have if there were no
vacancies or unfilled newly created directorships. No election of directors need be by written ballot.

(b) The power to adopt, amend or repeal the By-Laws of the Corporation may be
exercised by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

(c) The books of the Corporation may be kept at such place within or without the State
of Delaware as the By-Laws of the Corporation may provide or as may be designated from time to
time by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

SEVENTH: The Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Section 145 of the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as the same may be amended and supplemented
from time to time, indemnify and advance expenses to (i) its directors and officers and (ii) any
person who, while a director or officer of the Corporation, at the request of the Corporation is or
was serving as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise, from and against any and all of the expenses, liabilities, or other
matters referred to in or covered by said section as amended or supplemented (or any successor),
provided, however, that except with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification or
advancement of expenses, the Corporation shall not be required to indemnify or advance expenses

-22-
to any director or officer in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such director
or officer unless such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation. The Corporation, by action of its Board of Directors, may provide indemnification or
advance expenses to employees and agents of the Corporation or other persons (if such employees,
agents or other persons are not entitled to indemnification and/or advancement of expenses pursuant
to clauses (i) and (ii) above of this Article) only on such terms and conditions and to the extent
determined by the Board of Directors in its sole and absolute discretion. The indemnification
provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those indemnified
may be entitled under any By-Law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or
otherwise, both as to action in their official capacity and as to action in another capacity while
holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer,

employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a
person.

EIGHTH: No director of this Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation
or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director except to the
extent that exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware as in effect at the time such liability or limitation thereof
is determined. No amendment, modification or repeal of this Article shall apply to or have any
effect on the liability or alleged liability of any director of the Corporation for or with respect to any
acts or omissions of such director occurring prior to such amendment, modification or repeal.

NINTH: From time to time any of the provisions of this Restated Certificate of
Incorporation may be amended, altered or repealed, and other provisions authorized by the laws of
the State of Delaware at the time in force may be added or inserted in the manner and at the time
prescribed by said laws, and all rights at any time conferred upon the stockholders of the
Corporation by this Restated Certificate of Incorporation are granted subject to the provisions of this
Article.
