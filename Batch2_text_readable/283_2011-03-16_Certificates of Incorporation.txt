the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is

the value shall be the fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board

thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(iii) The Corporation shall give each holder of record of
Preferred Stock written notice of such impending transaction not later than twenty (20)
days prior to the stockholders’ meeting called to approve such transaction, or twenty (20)
days prior to the closing of such transaction, whichever is earlier, and shall also notify
such holders in writing of the final approval of such transaction. The first of such notices
shall describe the material terms and conditions of the impending transaction and the

convert the same and shall state therein the name or names in which the certificate or
certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued. The Corporation shall, as soon
as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred
Stock, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the
number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid.
Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of
business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted,
and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon
such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such
shares of Common Stock as of such date. If the conversion is in connection with (x) an
underwritten public offering of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, or (y) a public offering on a foreign stock exchange pursuant to the
rules and regulations of the applicable foreign jurisdiction, the conversion may, at the
option of any holder tendering any shares of Preferred Stock for conversion, be
conditioned upon the closing of the sale of securities pursuant to either such offering, in
which event the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such
conversion of the applicable Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such
shares of Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities.

(d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Junior Series of Preferred
Stock. The respective Conversion Prices of the Junior Series of Preferred Stock shall be

subject to adjustment from time to time as set forth below in this Section (B)3(d);
provided, however, that, unlike the Series H Preferred Stock, Series H-1 Preferred Stock
Series I Preferred Stock, Series J Preferred Stock and Series K Preferred Stock, the
respective Conversion Prices of the Junior Series of Preferred Stock shall not be subject
to adjustment based on the Corporation’s issuance of Additional Stock (as defined
below).

(i) In the event the Corporation should at any time or from
time to time after the Purchase Date fix a record date for the effectuation of a split or
subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or for the determination of
holders of Common Stock entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in
additional shares of Common Stock or other securities or rights convertible into, or
entitling the holder thereof to receive directly or indirectly, additional shares of Common
Stock (hereinafter referred to as “Common Stock Equivalents”) without payment of any
consideration by such holder for the additional shares of Common Stock or the Common
Stock Equivalents (including the additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion or exercise thereof), then, as of such record date (or the date of such dividend
distribution, split or subdivision if no record date is fixed), the respective Conversion
Price of each Junior Series of Preferred Stock shall be appropriately decreased so that the
number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series
shall be increased in proportion to such increase of the aggregate of shares of Common
Stock outstanding and those issuable with respect to such Common Stock Equivalents.

(ii) If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
at any time after the Purchase Date is decreased by a combination of the outstanding
shares of Common Stock, then, following the record date of such combination, the

1]
respective Conversion Price of each Junior Series of Preferred Stock shall be
appropriately increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on
conversion of each share of such series shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease
in outstanding shares.

(e) Conversion Price Adjustments of Series H Preferred Stock,
Series H-1 Preferred Stock, Series I Preferred Stock, Series J Preferred Stock and Series

K Preferred Stock for Certain Dilutive Issuances, Splits and Combinations.

(i) The respective Conversion Prices of the Series H
Preferred Stock, Series H-1 Preferred Stock, Series I Preferred Stock, Series J Preferred
Stock and Series K Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as
follows:

(A) Ifthe Corporation shall issue, after the
Purchase Date, any Additional Stock (as defined below) without consideration or for a
consideration per share less than the respective Conversion Price of either the Series H
Preferred Stock, Series H-1 Preferred Stock, Series I Preferred Stock, Series J Preferred
Stock or Series K Preferred Stock, as applicable, in effect immediately prior to the
issuance of such Additional Stock, the respective Conversion Price of the Series H
Preferred Stock, Series H-1! Preferred Stock, Series I Preferred Stock, Series J Preferred
Stock or Series K Preferred Stock, as applicable, in effect immediately prior to each such
issuance shall forthwith (except as otherwise provided below in this Section (B)3(e)) be
adjusted: (x) in the case of the Series J Preferred Stock or Series K Preferred Stock, as
applicable, to a price equal to the consideration per share received by the Corporation for
such issuance or deemed issuance of the Additional Stock; and (y) in the case of the
Series H Preferred Stock, Series H-1 Preferred Stock or Series I Preferred Stock, as
applicable, to a price determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the
numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the
aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for such issuance would purchase at
such Conversion Price, and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares
of such Additional Stock. For the purpose of the above calculation with respect to the
respective Conversion Price of the Series H Preferred Stock, Series H-1 Preferred Stock
or Series I Preferred Stock, as applicable, the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such issuance: (I) shall include the number of shares
issuable upon conversion of then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock; but (II) shall not
include any outstanding warrants, options or other rights for the purchase of shares of
Common Stock or other convertible securities, which have not been exercised or
converted prior to such issuance.

(B) No adjustment of the respective Conversion
Price for any shares of Series H Preferred Stock, Series H-1 Preferred Stock or Series I
Preferred Stock, as applicable, shall be made in an amount less than five-hundredths of
one cent ($0.0005) per share, provided that any adjustments which are not required to be
made by reason of this sentence shall be carried forward and shall be either taken into

12
account in any subsequent adjustment made prior to three (3) years from the date of the
event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward, or shall be made at the end of
three (3) years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried
forward. Except to the limited extent provided for in Sections (B)3(e)(ii)(C)(3) and (4),
no adjustment of such Conversion Price pursuant to Sections (B)3(e)(i) or (ii) shall have
the effect of increasing the Conversion Price above the Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such adjustment.

(ii) The following provisions shall apply to any adjustment
to the respective Conversion Price of the Series H Preferred Stock, Series H-1 Preferred
Stock, Series I Preferred Stock, Series J Preferred Stock or Series K Preferred Stock, as
applicable, pursuant to Section (B)3(e)(i) above:

(A) In the case of the issuance of Common Stock
for cash, the consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before
deducting any reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or
incurred by the Corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the
issuance and sale thereof.

(B) In the case of the issuance of Common Stock
for a consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash
shall be deemed to be the fair value thereof as determined by the Board of Directors
irrespective of any accounting treatment.

(C) In the case of the issuance (whether before, on
or after the Purchase Date) of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common
Stock, securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock or
options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or exchangeable securities,
the following provisions shall apply for all purposes of Sections (B)3(e)(i), (B)3(e)(ii)
and (B)3(e)(iii):

(1) The aggregate maximum number of
shares of Common Stock deliverable upon exercise of such options to purchase or rights
to subscribe for Common Stock shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such
options or rights were issued (and not at the time of exercise of such options or rights),
for a consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in
Sections (B)3(e)(ii)(A) and (B)), if any, received by the Corporation upon the issuance of
such options or rights plus the minimum exercise price provided in such options or rights
for the Common Stock covered thereby.

(2) The aggregate maximum number of
shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of or in exchange for any such
convertible or exchangeable securities or upon the exercise of options to purchase or
rights to subscribe for such convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent
conversion or exchange thereof shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such
securities were issued or such options or rights were issued and for a consideration equal
to the consideration, if any, received by the Corporation for any such securities and

13
related options or rights (excluding any cash received on account of accrued interest or
accrued dividends), plus the minimum additional consideration, if any, to be received by
the Corporation (other than consideration consisting of the cancellation of liabilities or
obligations evidenced by convertible or exchangeable securities) upon the conversion or
exchange of such securities or the exercise of any related options or rights (the
consideration in each case to be determined in the manner provided in Sections

(B)3(€)(ii)(A) and (B)).

(3) In the event of any change in the
number of shares of Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to the
Corporation upon exercise of such options or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange
for such convertible or exchangeable securities, including, but not limited to, a change
resulting from the antidilution provisions thereof, the respective Conversion Price of the
Series H Preferred Stock, Series H-1 Preferred Stock, Series I Preferred Stock, Series J
Preferred Stock or Series K Preferred Stock, as applicable, to the extent in any way
affected by or computed using such options, rights or securities, shall be recomputed to
reflect such change, but no further adjustment shall be made for the actual issuance of
Common Stock or any payment of such consideration upon the exercise of any such
options or rights or the conversion or exchange of such securities.

(4) | Upon the expiration of any, or in the
case of the Series J Preferred Stock or Series K Preferred Stock all of, such options or
rights, the termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any
options or rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the respective
Conversion Price of the Series H Preferred Stock, Series H-1 Preferred Stock, Series I
Preferred Stock, Series J Preferred Stock or Series K Preferred Stock, as applicable, to
the extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, rights, or securities or
options or rights related to such securities, shall be recomputed to reflect the issuance of
only the number of shares of Common Stock (and convertible or exchangeable securities
which remain in effect) actually issued upon the exercise of such options or rights, upon
the conversion or exchange of such securities or upon the exercise of the options or rights
related to such securities.

(5) The number of shares of Common
Stock deemed issued and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to Sections
(B)3(e)(iii)(C)(1) and (2) shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect any change,
termination or expiration of the type described in either Sections (B)3(e)(iii)(C)(3) or (4).

(D) If Additional Stock, securities convertible into
Additional Stock or rights or options to purchase either Additional Stock or such
convertible securities are issued or sold together with other stock or securities or other
assets of the Corporation for a consideration which covers both, the consideration
allocable to such Additional Stock, convertible securities or rights or options shall be
computed as the portion of the consideration so received that the Board of Directors
reasonably determines in good faith to be allocable to such Additional Stock, convertible
securities or rights or options.

14
(iii) In the event the Corporation should at any time or
from time to time after the Purchase Date fix a record date for the effectuation of a split
or subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or for the determination of
holders of Common Stock entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in
additional shares of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents without payment of
any consideration by such holder for the additional shares of Common Stock or the
Common Stock Equivalents (including the additional shares of Common Stock issuable
upon conversion or exercise thereof), then, as of such record date (or the date of such
dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no record date is fixed), the respective
Conversion Price of the Series H Preferred Stock, Series H-1 Preferred Stock, Series I
Preferred Stock, Series J Preferred Stock or Series K Preferred Stock, as applicable, shall
be appropriately decreased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on
conversion of each share of such series shall be increased in proportion to such increase
of the aggregate of shares of Common Stock outstanding and those issuable with respect
to such Common Stock Equivalents.

(iv) If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
at any time after the Purchase Date is decreased by a combination of the outstanding
shares of Common Stock, then, following the record date of such combination, the
respective Conversion Price of the Series H Preferred Stock, Series H-1 Preferred Stock,
Series I Preferred Stock, Series J Preferred Stock or Series K Preferred Stock, as
applicable, shall be appropriately increased so that the number of shares of Common
Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be decreased in proportion
to such decrease in outstanding shares.

(v) “Additional Stock” shall mean any shares of Common
Stock issued (or deemed to have been issued pursuant to Section (B)3(e)(ii)(C)) by the
Corporation after the Purchase Date, other than:

(A) shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to a
transaction described in Section (B)3(e)(iii) hereof;

(B) shares of Common Stock issuable or issued:
(1) to directors, consultants, distributors or vendors (if in transactions with primarily non-
financing purposes) of the Corporation directly or pursuant to a stock option plan or
restricted stock plan approved by the Board of Directors at any time when the total
number of shares of Common Stock so issuable or issued after the Purchase Date does
not exceed two percent (2%) of the Fully-Diluted Capital Stock (as defined below)
immediately after the Purchase Date (appropriately adjusted to reflect subsequent
Recapitalizations), and such two percent (2%) limit shall be exclusive of any shares
issued or issuable upon the exercise of options and warrants outstanding on or before the
Purchase Date; (2) upon the grant or exercise of options under the Corporation’s 2005
Series H Preferred Stock Incentive Plan (as amended or replaced with a similar stock
incentive plan, the “Series H Preferred Stock Incentive Plan”), or upon the conversion of
shares of Series H Preferred Stock issued or issuable (outright or upon exercise of
options) under the Series H Preferred Stock Incentive Plan; (3) upon the grant or exercise
of options under the Corporation’s 2008 Common Stock Incentive Plan, as amended from

15
time to time; (4) in connection with a joint venture, strategic alliance, or other licensing
transactions with primarily non-financing purposes approved by the Board of Directors;
(5) in connection with a merger, acquisition or purchase of assets of a third party in a
transaction with primarily non-financing purposes approved by the Board of Directors;
and (6) to lenders, their affiliates or third party guarantors or other parties in connection
with commercial loan or debt financing transactions entered into by the Corporation, in
each case as approved by the Board of Directors. For purposes of this Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, the term “Fully-Diluted Capital Stock” shall include all
shares of Common Stock then outstanding and all shares of Common Stock issuable
upon: (A) conversion of all shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding; (B) conversion of
all other convertible securities then outstanding; and (C) exercise of all then outstanding
options, warrants and other securities and rights exercisable for or convertible into, or
entitling the holder thereof to receive directly or indirectly, any shares of Common Stock;

(C) shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock
issued or issuable pursuant to the conversion or exercise of securities (including, without
limitation, options, warrants and other rights) convertible or exercisable into shares of
Common Stock or Preferred Stock, if such convertible or exercisable securities are
outstanding on or before the Purchase Date;

(D) shares of Series K Preferred Stock issued
pursuant to the Series K Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of the Purchase
Date (the “Series K Purchase Agreement”), by and between the Corporation and the other
party signatory thereto, and shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof;
and

(E) shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock
issued or issuable in connection with any transaction where such securities are excepted
from the definition of “Additional Stock” by the affirmative vote of: (I) for so long as not
less than an aggregate of 196,500,000 shares of Series H Preferred Stock, Series H-1
Preferred Stock, Series I Preferred Stock, Series J Preferred Stock and Series K Preferred
Stock is issued and outstanding (as adjusted for subsequent Recapitalizations), the
holders of at least 66.67% of the then total outstanding shares of Series H Preferred
Stock, Series H-1 Preferred Stock, Series 1 Preferred Stock, Series J Preferred Stock and
Series K Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class (on an as-converted basis in
accordance with Section (B)4 below); (II) for so long as not less than an aggregate of
61,800,000 shares of Series J Preferred Stock and Series K Preferred Stock is issued and
outstanding (as adjusted for subsequent Recapitalizations), the holders of at least a
majority of the then total outstanding shares of Series J Preferred Stock and Series K
Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class (on an as-converted basis in accordance

of 196,500,000 shares of Series H Preferred Stock, Series H-1 Preferred Stock, Series I
Preferred Stock, Series J Preferred Stock and Series K Preferred Stock is issued and
outstanding (as adjusted for subsequent Recapitalizations), the holders of at least a
majority of the then total outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a
single class (on an as-converted basis in accordance with Section (B)4 below).

16
(f) Other Distributions. In the event the Corporation shall
declare a distribution payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness
issued by the Corporation or other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options
or rights not referred to in Section (B)3(d)(i) or Section (B)3(e)(iii), then, in each such
case for the purpose of this Section (B)3(f), the holders of Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to a proportionate share of any such distribution as though they were the holders
of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation into which their shares of
Preferred Stock are convertible as of the record date fixed for the determination of the
holders of Common Stock of the Corporation entitled to receive such distribution.

(g) Recapitalizations. If at any time or from time to time there
shall be a Recapitalization of the Common Stock or a reorganization, merger or
consolidation of the Corporation (other than a subdivision, combination or Liquidation
provided for elsewhere in Section (B)2 or this Section (B)3), provision shall be made so
that the holders of Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion
of such holder’s shares of Preferred Stock, the number of shares of stock or other
securities or property of the Corporation or otherwise, to which a holder of Common
Stock deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled on such Recapitalization or
reorganization, merger or consolidation. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall
be made in the application of the provisions of this Section (B)3 with respect to the rights
of the holders of Preferred Stock after the Recapitalization or reorganization, merger or
consolidation to the end that the provisions of this Section (B)3 (including adjustment of
the Conversion Price then in effect and the number of shares purchasable upon
conversion of such holder’s shares of Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event
as nearly equivalent as may be practicable. This Section (B)3(g) shall apply similarly to
successive Recapitalizations and reorganizations, mergers and consolidations.

(h) No Fractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments.

(i) No fractional shares shall be issued upon conversion of
Preferred Stock, and the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued shall be
rounded to the nearest whole share.

(ii) Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock pursuant to this
Section (B)3, the Corporation, at its expense, shall promptly compute such adjustment or
readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and prepare and furnish to each holder
of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing
in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation
shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock, furnish or
cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (A) such adjustment
and readjustment, (B) the applicable Conversion Price at the time in effect, and (C) the
number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at
the time would be received upon the conversion of a share of Preferred Stock.

(i) Notices of Record Date. In the event of any taking by the
Corporation of a record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of
determining the holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a
cash dividend) or other distribution, any right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise
acquire any shares of stock of any class or any other securities or property, or to receive
any other right, the Corporation shall send by first class mail return receipt requested,
overnight courier, facsimile or e-mail to each holder of Preferred Stock, at least twenty
(20) days prior to the date specified therein, a notice specifying the date on which any
such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or right, and the
amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right; provided, however, that such
notice period may be shortened, to the extent allowable by applicable law (but to not less
than ten (10) days), upon the written consent of: (A) the holders of Preferred Stock that
are entitled to such notice rights and that represent at least a majority of the voting power
of all then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class (on an
as-converted basis in accordance with Section (B)4 below); (B) for so long as not less
than an aggregate of 196,500,000 shares of Series H Preferred Stock, Series H-1
Preferred Stock, Series I Preferred Stock, Series J Preferred Stock and Series K Preferred
Stock is issued and outstanding (as adjusted for subsequent Recapitalizations), the
holders of at least 66.67% of the then total outstanding shares of Series H Preferred
Stock, Series H-1 Preferred Stock, Series I Preferred Stock, Series J Preferred Stock and
Series K Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class (on an as-converted basis in
accordance with Section (B)4 below); and (C) for so long as not less than an aggregate of
61,800,000 shares of Series J Preferred Stock and Series K Preferred Stock is issued and
outstanding (as adjusted for subsequent Recapitalizations), the holders of at least a
majority of the then total outstanding shares of Series J Preferred Stock and Series K
Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class (on an as-converted basis in accordance
with Section (B)4 below).

(j) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The
Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued

shares of Common Stock solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of any shares
of Preferred Stock such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time
be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock; and if
at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be
sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, in
addition to such other remedies as shall be available to the holders of such Preferred
Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its
counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to
such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including, without
limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any
necessary amendment to this Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

(k) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this
Section (B)3 to be given to the holders of shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed
given if sent by first class mail return receipt requested, overnight courier, facsimile or e-
mail and addressed to each holder of record at his address, facsimile number or e-mail
address appearing on the books of the Corporation.

18
4, Voting Rights. The holder of each share of Preferred Stock shall
have the right to one vote for each share of Common Stock into which such share of
Preferred Stock could then be converted. Such holder shall have full voting rights and
powers equal to the voting rights and powers of the holders of Common Stock, and shall
be entitled, notwithstanding any provision hereof, to notice of any stockholders’ meeting
in accordance with the bylaws of the Corporation, and shall be entitled to vote, together
with holders of Common Stock (except to the extent that voting as a separate class or
series is required by law, this Restated Certificate of Incorporation or otherwise), with
respect to any question upon which holders of Common Stock have the right to vote.
Fractional votes shall not, however, be permitted and any fractional voting rights
available on an as-converted basis (after separately aggregating all shares into which
shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder could be converted) shall be rounded to the
nearest whole number (with one-half being rounded upward).

ARTICLE V

The Corporation is to have perpetual existence.

ARTICLE VI

Whenever a compromise is proposed between the Corporation and its creditors or
any class of them and/or between the Corporation and its stockholders or any class of
them, any court of equitable jurisdiction within the State of Delaware may, on the
application in a summary way of the Corporation or of any creditor or stockholder thereof
or on the application of any receiver or receivers appointed for the Corporation under the
provisions of Section 291 of the General Corporation Law or on the application of
trustees in dissolution or of any receiver or receivers appointed for the Corporation under
the provisions of Section 279 of the General Corporation Law order a meeting of the
creditors, or class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of the
Corporation, as the case may be, to be summoned in such manner as the said court
directs. If a majority in number representing three-fourths in value of the creditors or
class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of the Corporation,
as the case may be, agree to any compromise or arrangement and to any reorganization of
the Corporation as a consequence of such compromise or arrangement, the same
compromise or arrangement and said reorganization shall, if sanctioned by the court to
which said application has been made, be binding on all the creditors or class of creditors,
and/or on all the stockholders or class of stockholders, of the Corporation, as the case
may be, and also on the Corporation.

ARTICLE VII

For the management of the business and for the conduct of the affairs of the
Corporation, and in further definition, limitation, and regulation of the powers of the
Corporation and of its directors and of its stockholders or any class thereof, as the case
may be, it is further provided:

(A) The management of the business and the conduct of the affairs of the
Corporation shall be vested in the Board of Directors. Subject to Section (B)5(a)(viii) of
Article IV, the total number of directors which shall constitute the whole Board of
Directors shall be fixed by, or in the manner provided in, the Bylaws. The phrase “whole
Board” and the phrase “total number of directors” shall be deemed to have the same
meaning, to wit, the total number of directors which the Corporation would have if there
were no vacancies. No election of directors need be by written ballot.

23
(B) After the original or other Bylaws of the Corporation have been adopted,
amended, or repealed, as the case may be, in accordance with the provisions of Section
109 of the General Corporation Law, and, after the Corporation has received any
payment for any of its stock, subject to Section (B)5(a)(vii) of Article IV, the power to
adopt, amend, or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation may be exercised by the Board of
Directors; provided, however, that any provision for the classification of directors of the
Corporation for staggered terms pursuant to the provisions of subsection (d) of Section
141 of the General Corporation Law shall be set forth in an initial Bylaw or in a Bylaw
adopted by the stockholders of the Corporation entitled to vote, unless provisions for such
classification shall be set forth in this Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

(C) | Whenever the Corporation shall be authorized to issue only one class of
stock, each outstanding share shall entitle the holder thereof to notice of, and the right to
vote at, any meeting of stockholders. Whenever the Corporation shall be authorized to
issue more than one class of stock, no outstanding share of any class of stock which is
denied voting power under the provisions of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation
shall entitle the holder thereof to the right to vote at any meeting of stockholders except
as the provisions of paragraph (2) of subsection (b) of Section 242 of the General
Corporation Law shall otherwise require; provided, that no share of any such class which
is otherwise denied voting power shall entitle the holder thereof to vote upon the increase
or decrease in the number of authorized shares of said class.

ARTICLE VIII

The personal liability of the directors of the Corporation is hereby eliminated to
the fullest extent permitted by the provisions of paragraph (7) of subsection (b) of Section
102 of the General Corporation Law, as the same may be amended and supplemented.
Neither any amendment or repeal of this Article VIII nor the adoption of any provision of
this Restated Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this Article VIII shall
eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article VIII in respect of any matters occurring, or
any cause of action, suit or claim accruing or arising, or that, but for this Article VIII,
would accrue or arise, prior to such amendment, repeal or adoption of such inconsistent
provision.

ARTICLE IX

The Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by the provisions of
Section 145 of the General Corporation Law, as the same may be amended and
supplemented, have the power to indemnify any and all persons from and against any and
all of the expenses, liabilities, or other matters referred to in or covered by said section.

ARTICLE X

From time to time any of the provisions of this Restated Certificate of
Incorporation may be amended, altered, or repealed, and other provisions authorized by
the laws of the State of Delaware at the time in force may be added or inserted in the
manner and at the time prescribed by said laws, and all rights at any time conferred upon

24
the stockholders of the Corporation by this Restated Certificate of Incorporation are
granted subject to the provisions of this Article X and the protective provisions of Section
(B)5 of Article IV herein.
