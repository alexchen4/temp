OF
ADKNOWLEDGE, INC.

The undersigned, Scott Lynn, hereby certifies that:

1. He is the duly elected and acting Chief Executive Officer of Adknowledge, Inc., a
Delaware corporation.

2. The Certificate of Incorporation of this corporation was originally filed with the
Secretary of State of Delaware on April 3, 2002, under the name of Virtumundo, Inc.

3. The Certificate of Incorporation of this corporation shall be amended and restated
to read in full as follows:

“ARTICLE I

“The name of this corporation is Adknowledge, Inc. (the “Corporation”).
| ARTICLE I

The address of the Corporation’s registered office in the State of Delaware is 1209
Orange Street in the City of Wilmington, Delaware 19801, County of New Castle. The name of
its registered agent at such address is The Corporation Trust Company.

ARTICLE ITI

The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which
corporations may be organized under the Delaware General Corporation Law.

ARTICLE IV

Upon the effective filing hereof, a reclassification of the Corporation’s outstanding
Common Stock, $0.0001 par value per share (the “Old Common Stock”), shall become effective
such that each share of Old Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the filing of this
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Restated Certificate”) shall be
automatically reclassified into one (1) share of Series A Common Stock (as defined below)
without any further action by the holder thereof (the “Reclassification”) and whether or not the
certificates representing the shares of Old Common Stock are surrendered to the Corporation.

Upon the occurrence of the Reclassification, the holders of the Old Common Stock shall
surrender the certificates representing such shares at the office of the Corporation. Thereupon,
there shall be issued and delivered to such holder, promptly at such office and in the name shown
on such surrendered certificate or certificates, a certificate of certificates for the number of shares

45708709.10
of Series A Common Stock into which the surrendered shares of Old Common Stock are
reclassified, dated as of the date on which the Reclassification occurs. The Corporation shall not
be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Series A Common Stock issuable upon
such reclassification unless certificates evidencing such shares of such Old Common Stock are
either delivered to the Corporation, as hereinafter provided, or the holder notifies the Corporation
that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory
to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection
therewith.

Upon the effectiveness hereof, the authorized capital stock of the Corporation shall be as follows:

(A) Classes of Stock. The Corporation is authorized to issue two classes of stock to
be designated, respectively, “Common Stock” and “Preferred Stock.” The total number of shares
which the Corporation is authorized to issue is forty million (40,000,000) shares, each with a par
value of $0.0001 per share. Thirty-five million four-hundred thousand (35,400,000) shares shall
be Common Stock, thirty million four hundred thousand (30,400,000) shares of which are
designated as “Series A Common Stock” and five million (5,000,000) shares of which are
designated as “Series B Common Stock”. Four million six-hundred thousand (4,600,000) shares
shall be Preferred Stock.

(B) Rights, Preferences and Restrictions of Preferred Stock. The Preferred Stock
authorized by this Restated Certificate may be issued from time to time in one or more series.

Four million six-hundred thousand (4,600,000) shares of Preferred Stock shall be designated
“Series A Preferred Stock”. The rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions granted to and
imposed on the Series A Preferred Stock are as set forth below in this Article IV(B).

Subject to compliance with applicable protective voting rights which have been or may be
granted to the Preferred Stock or series thereof in Certificates of Designations or the
Corporation’s Certificate of Incorporation, including, without limitation, Section 6 hereof,
(“Protective Provisions”), but notwithstanding any other rights of the Preferred Stock or any
series thereof, the rights, privileges, preferences and restrictions of any such additional series may
be subordinated to, pari passu with (including, without limitation, inclusion in provisions with
respect to liquidation and acquisition preferences, redemption and/or approval of matters by vote
or written consent), or senior to any of those of any present or future class or series of Preferred
or Common Stock. Subject to compliance with applicable Protective Provisions, the Board of
Directors is also authorized to increase or decrease the number of shares of any series (other than
the Series A Preferred Stock), prior or subsequent to the issue of that series, but not below the
number of shares of such series then outstanding. In case the number of shares of any series shall
be so decreased, the shares constituting such decrease shall resume the status which they had
prior to the adoption of the resolution originally fixing the number of shares of such series.

1. Dividend Provisions. Dividends of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be
payable only when, as, and if declared by the Board of Directors out of assets legally available
therefor. Subject to the rights of series of Preferred Stock which may from time-to-time come
into existence, any dividends declared by the Board of Directors or paid by the Corporation shall
be distributed among the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and Common Stock pro rata based

45708709.10 -2-
on the number of shares of Common Stock then held by each holder (assuming conversion of all
such Preferred Stock into Series A Common Stock). No right shall accrue to holders of shares of
Series A Preferred Stock by reason of the fact that dividends on said shares are not declared in
any prior year, nor shal] any undeclared or unpaid dividend bear or accrue any interest.

2. Liquidation.

(a) Preference. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding
up of the Corporation, either voluntary or involuntary, subject to the rights of series of Preferred
Stock that may from time-to-time come into existence, the holders of the Series A Preferred
Stock shall be entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any distribution of any of the assets
of the Corporation to the holders of Common Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, an
amount per share equal to $10.4553 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends,
reclassification and the like) for each share of Series A Preferred Stock then held by them, plus
declared but unpaid dividends (the “Liquidation Preference”). If, upon the occurrence of such
event, the assets and funds thus distributed among the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock
shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full aforesaid preferential
amounts, then, subject to the rights of series of Preferred Stock that may from time-to-time come
into existence, the entire assets and funds of the Corporation legally available for distribution
shall be distributed ratably among the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock in proportion to the
preferential amount each such holder is otherwise entitled to receive.

(b) Remaining Assets. Upon the completion of the distribution
required by Section 2(a) above and any other distribution that may be required with respect to
series of Preferred Stock that may from time-to-time come into existence, the remaining assets of
the Corporation available for distribution to stockholders shall be distributed among the holders
of the Series A Preferred Stock and the Common Stock pro rata based on the number of shares of
Common Stock held by each (assuming conversion of all such Preferred Stock into Series A
Common Stock). The total amount payable to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant
to Section 2(a) and (b) is the “Series A Aggregate Amount.”

(c) Certain Acquisitions.

(1) Deemed Liquidation. For purposes of this Section 2 and
Section 4, and not by way of limitation, a liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the
Corporation shall be deemed to occur (A) if the Corporation shall sell, convey, or otherwise
dispose of all or substantially all of its assets, property or business or merge with or into or
consolidate with any other corporation, limited liability company or other entity (other than a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation) or (B) upon the closing of the transfer (whether by
merger, consolidation or otherwise), in one transaction or series of related transactions, to a
person or group of affiliated persons (other than an underwriter of the Corporation’s securities),
of the Corporation’s securities if, after such closing, such person or group of affiliated persons
would hold 50% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the Corporation (or the surviving or
acquiring entity) (any such transaction, a “Liquidation Transaction”), provided that none of the
following shall be considered a Liquidation Transaction: (i) a merger effected exclusively for the
purpose of changing the domicile of the Corporation, or (ii) a transaction in which the

45708709.10 ~3-
stockholders of the Corporation immediately prior to the transaction own 50% or more of the
voting power of the surviving corporation following the transaction. The treatment of any
particular transaction or series of transactions as a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation may be waived by the vote or written consent of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding Series A Preferred Stock (voting as a separate class).

(it) Valuation of Consideration. In the event of a deemed
liquidation as described in Section 2(c)(i) above, if the consideration received by the Corporation
is other than cash, its value will be deemed its fair market value. Any securities shall be valued
as follows:

(A) Securities not subject to investment letter or other
similar restrictions on free marketability:

(1) If traded on a securities exchange or The
Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”), the per share value shall be deemed to be the average closing
price of a share of such securities on such exchange or Nasdaq over the twenty (20) trading day
period ending three (3) trading days prior to the closing of the deemed liquidation;

(2)  Ifactively traded over-the-counter, the per
share value shall deemed to be the average closing bid or sales price (whichever is applicable) of
a share of such securities over the twenty (20) trading day period ending three (3) trading days
prior to the closing of the deemed liquidation; and

(3) If there is no active public market, the value
shall be the fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors
(including one of the directors elected solely by the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock).

(B) The method of valuation of securities subject to
investment letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely
by virtue of a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an
appropriate discount from the market value determined as specified above in Section 2(c)(ii)(A)
to reflect the approximate fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors (including one of the directors elected solely by the holders of the Series A Preferred
Stock).

(iii) | The Corporation shall give each holder of record of
Preferred Stock written notice of such impending Liquidation Transaction not later than twenty
(20) days prior to the stockholders’ meeting called to approve such transaction, or twenty (20)
days prior to the closing of such transaction, whichever is earlier, and shall also notify such
holders in writing of the final approval of such transaction. The first of such notices shall
describe the material terms and conditions of the impending transaction and the provisions of this
Section 2, and the Corporation shall thereafter give such holders prompt notice of any material
changes to such terms and conditions. If the Corporation gives notice of material changes to
such terms and conditions pursuant to the preceding sentence, the transaction shall in no event be
consummated sooner than ten (10) days after the Corporation has given such notice; provided,

45708709.10 ~4-
however, that subject to compliance with the Delaware General Corporation Law such periods
may be shortened or waived upon the written consent of the holders of a majority of the Series A
Preferred Stock (voting as a separate class).

3. Redemption.

(a) Redemption at Option of Holders, At any time after February
16, 2012, the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock,
acting together as a separate class (collectively, the “Majority Holders”), may require the
Corporation to redeem all, but not less than all, of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred
Stock out of funds legally available therefor, in accordance with the provisions contained in this
Section 3(a). If the funds of the Corporation legally available for redemption of such shares are
insufficient to redeem the total number of shares to be redeemed, then such shares shall be
redeemed on a pro rata basis, based on the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock
outstanding. The shares of Series A Preferred Stock not redeemed shall remain outstanding and
entitled to all the rights and preferences provided herein. Any time thereafter when additional
funds of the Corporation are legally available for the redemption of shares of Series A Preferred
Stock, such funds will immediately be used to redeem the balance of the shares that the
Corporation has become obliged to redeem but that it has not redeemed.

(b) Redemption Price. The price at which each share of Series A
Preferred Stock will be redeemed will be an amount equal to (i) $10.4553 (as adjusted for stock
splits, stock dividends, reclassification and the like) plus all declared and unpaid dividends, plus
(ii) such additional amount as is necessary to provide the holder of such share an IRR (as defined
below) of fifteen percent (15%) (the “Series A Redemption Price”). For the purposes of
calculating the Series A Redemption Price, the term “IRR” shall be calculated using the
following formula: ;

IRR = (FV/PV)"-1, where
“FY” equals the cash amount of the Series A Redemption Price;

“PV” equals $10.4553 (as adjusted for stock splits, stock
dividends, reclassification and the like); and

“ny” equals the quotient of (A) the number of days from the Purchase Date
(as defined below) to the applicable Preferred Stock Redemption Date (as defined below) at
which such share is actually redeemed divided by (B) three hundred sixty-five (365).

(c) Exercise of Option to Redeem. If the Majority Holders elect to

' exercise their option to cause the Corporation to redeem all of the outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 3, such Majority Holders must deliver written notice
thereof of such election to the Corporation (a “Redemption Notice”). Following receipt of the
Redemption Notice, the Corporation shall mail, first class postage prepaid, at least fifteen (15)
but no more than thirty (30) days prior to each Preferred Stock Redemption Date, written notice
(the “Redemption Date Notice”) to each holder of record (at the close of business on the business

45708709.10 -5-
day next preceding the day on which notice is given) of Series A Preferred Stock, at the address
last shown on the records.of the Corporation for such holder, notifying such holder of the
redemption to be effected on the applicable Preferred Stock Redemption Date, specifying the
number of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed from such holder, the Series A
Redemption Price and the place at which payment may be obtained and calling upon such holder
to surrender to the Corporation, in the manner and at the place designated, his, her or its
certificate or certificates representing the shares to be redeemed. The redemption election, once
made, is irrevocable. The Corporation may, at its election, effect the redemption of shares of
Series A Preferred Stock in three equal installments (pro rata as among the Series A Preferred
Stock based on the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding) on the following
dates: (1) one-hundred eighty (180) days after the date upon which the Corporation receives such
Redemption Notice (or the first business day thereafter); (2) three hundred sixty (360) days after
the date upon which the Corporation receives such Redemption Notice (or the first business day
thereafter); and (3) five-hundred forty (540) days after the date upon which the Corporation
receives such Redemption Notice (or the first business day thereafter). Each such date of
redemption shall be referred to as a “Preferred Stock Redemption Date.” Holders of shares of
Series A Preferred Stock will be required to present and surrender the certificate or certificates
representing shares to be redeemed on each Preferred Redemption Date (duly endorsed for
transfer) to the Corporation at the principal executive offices of the Corporation no later than
three (3) business days prior to the applicable Preferred Stock Redemption Date. The
Corporation shall pay the Series A Redemption Price to, or to the order of, the person whose
name appears on such certificate or certificates so surrendered. If the number of shares
represented by the certificate or certificates surrendered shall exceed the number of shares to be
redeemed, the Corporation shall issue and deliver on the Preferred Stock Redemption Date to the
person entitled thereto a certificate or certificates representing the unredeemed balance of such
shares.

(d) Effect of Redemption. From and after each Preferred Stock
Redemption Date, unless the Corporation shall default in providing for the payment of the Series
A Redemption Price, all dividends (if any) shall cease to accrue with respect to the shares to be
redeemed on such Preferred Stock Redemption Date pursuant to this Section 3, and all rights of
the holders of any shares subject to redemption on such Preferred Redemption Date as
shareholders of the Corporation, except the right to receive the Series A Redemption Price shall
cease and terminate. Any shares of Series A Preferred Stock that are redeemed by the
Corporation shall be retired and shall not be reissued.

4. Conversion. The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall have
conversion rights as follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Subject to Section 4(c), each share of Series A
Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date
of issuance of such share and in any event on or prior to the fifth day prior to the Preferred Stock
Redemption Date, if any, as may have been fixed in any Redemption Date Notice with respect to
such share of Series A Preferred Stock, at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for
such stock, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Series A Common Stock
as is determined by dividing $10.4553 by the Conversion Price applicable to such share,

45708709.10 -6-
determined as hereafter provided, in effect on the date the certificate is surrendered for
conversion. The initial Conversion Price per share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be
$10.4553. Such initial Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in Section
4(d).

(b) Automatic Conversion.

(i) Subject to subsection (b)(ii) below, each share of Series A Preferred
Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of Series A Common Stock at the Conversion
Price at the time in effect for such share immediately upon the earlier of (i) except as provided
below in Section 4(c), the Corporation’s sale of its Series A Common Stock in a firm
commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to a registration statement under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), the public offering price of which is
not less than $20.9106 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reclassification and
the like) and which results in aggregate gross cash proceeds to the Corporation of not less than
$50,000,000 ( “Qualifying IPO”), or (ii) the date specified by written consent or agreement of the
holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, acting together
as a separate class.

(ii) In the event that (A) the Series A Preferred Stock is automatically
converted to Series A Common Stock pursuant to section 4(b)(i) hereof or (B) the holders of the
Series A Preferred Stock convert all of such Series A Preferred Stock to Series A Common Stock
in connection with and prior to or concurrently with the closing of the initial public offering of
the Corporation’s Series A Common Stock pursuant to a registration statement under the
Securities Act (an “IPO”), the number of shares of Series A Common Stock issuable to the
holders of Series A Preferred Stock, in the aggregate, upon such conversion shall be the number
of shares of Series A Common Stock into which the Series A Preferred Stock is convertible at
the Conversion Price at the time in effect for such share plus the Adjustment Amount. For
purposes hereof, the “Adjustment Amount” shall be a number of shares of Series A Common
Stock equal to (A) (x) an amount equal to what the Series A Aggregate Amount would have
been upon the consummation of a Liquidation Transaction in which the consideration available
for distribution to the stockholders in such Liquidation Transaction had a value equal to the
valuation of the Corporation in the IPO (such valuation based on the price per share on the cover
page of the final prospectus (the “IPO Share Price”) multiplied by the number of fully diluted
shares (the "Fully Diluted Shares") included by the underwriters in determining the pre-offering
valuation of the Corporation (the "IPO Valuation") minus (y) an amount equal to the IPO Share
Price multiplied by the number of shares into which the Series A Preferred Stock is convertible at
the Conversion Price at the time in effect for such share divided by (B) the IPO Share Price. The
portion of the Adjustment Amount that each holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled
to under this paragraph shall equal the Adjustment Amount multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock held such holder and the
denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the conversion contemplated in this paragraph. Any fractional share
resulting from such calculation shall be rounded to the nearest whole share.

45708709.10 -7-
In formulaic form,
(CLP + P) —(A x PS))/PS = Adjustment Amount, where

"LP " equals the aggregate Liquidation Preference of the Series A Preferred Stock as
determined under Section 2(a)

"P” equals the amount which would be distributed to the holders of the Series A
Preferred Stock under Section 2(b) if the assets and funds available for distribution under Section
2 equaled the IPO Valuation

"PS" equals the IPO Share Price

"A" equals the number of shares of Series A Common Stock into with the Series A
Preferred Stock is convertible at the IPO, without regard to the Adjustment Amount.

By way of illustration, if the Corporation had 25,000,000 Fully Diluted Shares, including
5,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, there were no dividends declared on the Series A
Preferred Stock that remained unpaid at the time of the IPO, the Conversion Price per share of
Series A Preferred Stock at the time of the IPO was $10 and the IPO Share Price was $20 per
share, then:

LP = $50M
P= $90M
PS = $20

A=5M
The Adjustment Amount would be: (($50M+$90M) — (5M x $20))/$20 =
2M additional shares.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Series A
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert such Preferred Stock into shares of Series A Common
Stock, the holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the
office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for such series of Preferred Stock, and shall
give written notice to the Corporation at its principal corporate office, of the election to convert
the same and shall state therein the name or names in which the certificate or certificates for
shares of Series A Common Stock are to be issued. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable
thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or
nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Series A
Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid. Such conversion shall be
deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such
surrender of the shares of such series of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or
persons entitled to receive the shares of Series A Common Stock issuable upon such conversion
shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Series A
Common Stock as of such date. If the conversion is in connection with an underwritten public

45708709.10 -8-
offering of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act the conversion may, at the option
of any holder tendering such Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing
with the underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering, in which event any
persons entitled to receive Series A Common Stock upon conversion of such Preferred Stock
shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing
of such sale of securities.

(d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock for Certain
Dilutive Issuances, Splits and Combinations. The Conversion Price of the Series A Preferred

Stock shail be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

(i) Issuance of Additional Stock below Purchase Price. If
the Corporation should issue, at any time after the date upon which any shares of Series A
Preferred Stock were first issued (the “Purchase Date” with respect to such series), any
Additional Stock (as defined below) without consideration or for a consideration per share less
than the Conversion Price for such series in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such
Additional Stock, the Conversion Price for such series in effect immediately prior to each such
issuance shall automatically be adjusted as set forth in this Section 4(d)(i), unless otherwise
provided in this Section 4(d)(i).

(A) Adjustment Formula. Whenever the Conversion
Price is adjusted pursuant to this Section (4)(d)(i), the new Conversion Price shall be determined
by multiplying the Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction, (x) the numerator of which shall
be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance (the
“Outstanding Common’) plus the number of shares of Series A Common Stock that the
aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for such issuance would purchase at such
Conversion Price; and (y) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Outstanding
Common plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock. For purposes of the foregoing
calculation, the term “Outstanding Common” shall include shares of Common Stock deemed
issued pursuant to Section 4(d)(i)(E) below.

(B) Definition of “Additional Stock”. For purposes of
this Section 4(d)(i), “Additional Stock” shall mean any shares of Common Stock issued (or
deemed to have been issued pursuant to Section 4(d)(i)(E)) by the Corporation after the Purchase
Date) other than:

(1) Common Stock issued pursuant to stock
dividends, stock splits or similar transactions, as described in Section 4(d)(ii) hereof;

(2) Shares of Common Stock issued or issuable
to employees, consultants or directors of the Corporation directly or pursuant to a stock option
plan or restricted stock plan approved by the Board of Directors of the Corporation;

(3) Capital stock, or options or warrants to

purchase capital stock, issued to financial institutions or lessors in connection with commercial
credit arrangements, equipment financings, commercial property lease transactions or similar

45708709.10 -9-
transactions, provided that such issuances are for other than primarily equity financing purposes
and are approved by the Board of Directors of the Corporation;

(4) | Shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock
issuable upon exercise of warrants outstanding as of the Purchase Date;

(5) Capital stock, or warrants or options to
purchase capital stock, issued in connection with bona fide acquisitions, mergers or similar
transactions of commercial operating entities or assets by the Corporation, the terms of which are
approved by the Board of Directors of the Corporation;

(6) Shares of Series A Common Stock issued or
issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock;

(7) Shares of Common Stock issued or issuable
in an underwritten public offering;

(8) Capital stock issued or issuable to an entity
as a component of any business relationship with such entity for the purpose of (A) joint venture,
technology licensing or development activities, (B) distribution, supply or manufacture of the
Corporation’s products or services or (C) any other arrangements involving corporate partners
that are primarily for purposes other than raising capital, the terms of which business relationship
with such entity are approved by the Board of Directors;

(9) Shares of Common Stock issued or issuable
with the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class; and

(10) Shares of Series A Common Stock issued
pursuant to the conversion of Series B Common Stock.

(C) No Fractional Adjustments. No adjustment of the
Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred Stock shall be made in an amount less than one-tenth
of one cent per share, provided that any adjustments that are not required to be made by reason of
this sentence shall be carried forward and shall be either taken into account in any subsequent
adjustment made prior to three (3) years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment
being carried forward, or shall be made at the end of three (3) years from the date of the event
giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward..

(D) Determination of Consideration. In the case of
the issuance of Common Stock for cash, the consideration shal! be deemed to be the amount of
cash paid therefor before deducting any reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses
allowed, paid or incurred by the Corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection
with the issuance and sale thereof. In the case of the issuance of the Common Stock for a
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be
deemed to be the fair value thereof as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors
irrespective of any accounting treatment.

45708709.10 -10-
(E) Deemed Issuances of Common Stock. In the case
of the issuance (whether before, on or after the applicable Purchase Date) of securities or nghts
convertible into or exercisable for, or entitling the holder thereof to receive directly or indirectly,
additional shares of Common Stock (the “Common Stock Equivalents”), the following
provisions shall apply for all purposes of this Section 4(d)(i):

(1) The aggregate maximum number of shares
of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion, exchange or exercise (assuming the satisfaction
of any conditions to convertibility, exchangeability or exercisability, including, without
limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account potential antidilution
adjustments) of any Common Stock Equivalents and subsequent conversion, exchange or
exercise thereof shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or
such Common Stock Equivalents were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration,
if any, received by the Corporation for any such securities and related Common Stock
Equivalents (excluding any cash received on account of accrmed interest or accrued dividends),
plus the minimum additional consideration, if any, to be received by the Corporation (without
taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) upon the conversion, exchange or exercise
of any Common Stock Equivalents (the consideration in each case to be determined in the
manner provided in Section 4(d)()(D).

(2) ‘In the event of any change in the number of
shares of Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon
conversion, exchange or exercise of any Common Stock Equivalents including, but not limited
to, a change resulting from the antidilution provisions thereof, the Conversion Price of any series
of Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such Common Stock
Equivalents, shall be recomputed to reflect such change, but no further adjustment shall be made
for the actual issuance of Common Stock or any payment of such consideration upon the
conversion, exchange or exercise of such Common Stock Equivalents.

(3) | Upon the termination or expiration of the
convertibility, exchangeability or exercisability of any Common Stock Equivalents, the
Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or
computed using such Common Stock Equivalents, shall be recomputed to reflect the issuance of
only the number of shares of Common Stock (and Common Stock Equivalents that remain
convertible, exchangeable or exercisable) actually issued upon the conversion, exchange or
exercise of such Common Stock Equivalents.

(4) The number of shares of Common Stock
deemed issued and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to Section 4(d){i)(E)(1) shall
be appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or expiration of the type described in
either Section 4(d)(i)(E)(2) or 4(d)(D (EB).

(F) No Increased Conversion Price. Notwithstanding
any other provisions of this Section (4)(d){i), except to the limited extent provided for in Sections
4(d)(i)(EX(2) and 4(d)(i)(E)(3), no adjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section

45708709.10 -I1-
4(d)(i) shall have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price above the Conversion Price in
effect immediately prior to such adjustment.

(ii) | Stock Splits and Dividends. In the event the Corporation
should at any time after the Purchase Date fix a record date for the effectuation of a split or
subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or the determination of holders of
Common Stock entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of
Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents without payment of any consideration by such
holder for the additional shares of Common Stock or the Common Stock Equivalents (including
the additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof), then, as of
such record date (or the date of such dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no record date
is fixed), the Conversion Price of each of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be appropriately
decreased so that the number of shares of Series A Common Stock issuable on conversion of
each share of such series shall be increased in proportion to such increase of the aggregate of
shares of Common Stock outstanding and those issuable with respect to such Common Stock
Equivalents with the number of shares issuable with respect to Common Stock Equivalents
determined from time to time in the manner provided for deemed issuances in Section 4(d)G)().

(iii) Reverse Stock Splits. If the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding at any time after the Purchase Date is decreased by a combination of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock, then, following the record date of such combination, the
Conversion Price for each of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be appropriately increased so that
the number of shares of Series A Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such
series shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares.

(e) Other Distributions. In the event the Corporation shall declare a
distribution payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by the
Corporation or other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred
to in Section 4(d)(ii), then, in each such case for the purpose of this Section 4(e), the holders of
Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any such distribution as
though they were the holders of the number of shares of Series A Common Stock of the
Corporation into which their shares of Preferred Stock are convertible as of the record date fixed
for the determination of the holders of Common Stock of the Corporation entitled to receive such
distribution.

(f) Recapitalizations. If at any time or from time to time there shall
be a recapitalization of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision, combination or merger or
sale of assets transaction provided for elsewhere in this Section 4 or Section 2) provision shall be
made so that the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive
upon conversion of such Preferred Stock the number of shares of stock or other securities or
property of the Corporation or otherwise, to which a holder of Series A Common Stock
deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled on such recapitalization. In any such case,
appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 4 with
respect to the rights of the holders of such Preferred Stock after the recapitalization to the end
that the provisions of this Section 4 (including adjustment of the Conversion Price then in effect

45708709.10 -12-
and the number of shares purchasable upon conversion of such Preferred Stock) shall be
applicable after that event and be as nearly equivalent as practicable.

(g) | NoImpairment. The Corporation will not, by amendment of its
Certificate of Incorporation (except in accordance with Section 6 hereof and applicable law) or
through any reorganization, recapitalization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution,
issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or
performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Corporation, but
will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Section 4 and
in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the
Conversion Rights of the holders of Preferred Stock against impairment.

(bh) No Fractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments.

(i) No fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of
any share or shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, and the number of shares of Series A
Common Stock to be issued shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share. The number of
shares issuable upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of
shares of Series A Preferred Stock the holder is at the time converting into Series A Common
Stock and the number of shares of Series A Common Stock issuable upon such aggregate
conversion.

(ii) | Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of
the Conversion Price of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation, at
its expense, shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the
terms hereof and prepare and furnish to each holder of such Preferred Stock a certificate setting
forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such
adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon the written request at any time
of any holder of Series A Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like
certificate setting forth (A) such adjustment and readjustment, (B) the Conversion Price for such
series of Preferred Stock at the time in effect, and (C) the number of shares of Series A Common
Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon the
conversion of a share of such series of Preferred Stock.

(i) Notices of Record Date. In the event of any taking by the
Corporation of a record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining
the holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend) or other
distribution, any right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of stock of any
class or any other securities or property, or to receive any other right, the Corporation shall mail
to each holder of Series A Preferred Stock, at least ten (10) days prior to the date specified
therein, a notice specifying the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of
such dividend, distribution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution

Series A Preferred Stock, such number of its shares of Series A Common Stock as shall from
time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of such series of
Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Series A
Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of
such series of Preferred Stock, in addition to such other remedies as shall be available to the
holder of such Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the
opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Series A
Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including,
without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any
necessary amendment to this Restated Certificate.

(k) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Section 4 to
