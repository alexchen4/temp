shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing $1.55 by the Series B Conversion Price
(as defined below) in effect at the time of conversion. The ‘Series B Conversion Price” is

Preferred Stock may be converted into shares of Common Stock, shall be subject to adjustment

(iii) | Each share of Series C Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the
option of the holder thereof, at any time and from time to time, and without the payment of

USIDOCS 5486063 v2
shares of Series C Preferred Stock may be converted into shares of Common Stock, shall be
subject to adjustment as provided below.

(iv) In the event of a notice of redemption of any shares of Series A
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 6
hereof, the Conversion Rights of the shares designated for redemption shall terminate at the close
of business on the full day preceding the date fixed for redemption, unless the redemption price
is not paid when due, in which case the Conversion Rights for such shares shal! continue until
such price is paid in full. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation, the Conversion Rights shall terminate at the close of business on the second full day
preceding the date fixed for the payment of any amounts distributable on such event to the
holders of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock, as the
case may be. In the event of such a redemption or liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the

dissolution or winding up, which notice shall (i) be sent at least 15 days prior to the termination
of the Conversion Rights and (ii) state the amount per share of Series A Preferred, Series B
Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock, as the case may be, that will be paid or distributed

upon conversion of the Series Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the
holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction
multiplied by the then effective Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series
C Conversion Price, as the case may be.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion.

{i) In order for a holder of Series Preferred Stock to convert shares of
Series Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the certificate
or certificates for such shares of Series Preferred Stock, at the office of the transfer agent for the
applicable series of Series Preferred Stock (or at the principal office of the Corporation if the
Corporation serves as its own transfer agent), together with written notice that such holder elects
to convert all or any number of the shares of Series Preferred Stock represented by such
certificate or certificates. Such notice shall state such holder's name or the names of the
nominees in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock
to be issued. If required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be
endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory
to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or his or its attomey duly authorized in
writing. The date of receipt of such certificates and notice by the transfer agent (or by the
Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent) shall be the conversion date
(“Conversion Date”), The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after the Conversion Date,
issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Series Preferred Stock, or to his or its nominees,
a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall
be entitled, together with cash in lieu of any fraction of a share.

USI DOCS 54860632
(ii) | The Corporation shall at all times when any Series Preferred Stock
shall be outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued stock, for the
purpose of effecting the conversion of the Series Preferred Stock, such number of its duly
authorized shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding Series Preferred Stock. Before taking any action which would
cause an adjustment reducing the Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series
C Conversion Price below the then par value of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of the applicable series of Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take any corporate
action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Corporation may
validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock at such adjusted
Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series C Conversion Price, as the case
may be.

(iii) | Upon any such conversion, no adjustment to the Series A
Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series C Conversion Price shall be made for any
declared but unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Conversion Price or
Series C Conversion Price, as the case may be, surrendered for conversion or on the Common
Stock delivered upon conversion.

(iv) All shares of Series Preferred Stock which shall have been
surrendered for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and
all rights with respect to such shares, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and to vote,
shall immediately cease and terminate on the Conversion Date, except only the right of the
holders thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor and payment of any
dividends declared but unpaid thereon. Any shares of Series Preferred Stock so converted shall
be retired and cancelled and shal! not be reissued, and the Corporation (without the need for
stockholder action) may from time to time take such appropriate action as may be necessary to
reduce the authorized number of shares of such series of Preferred Stock accordingly.

(v) The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and other taxes that
may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon
conversion of shares of Series Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4. The Corporation shall
not, however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer
involved in the issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in
which the shares of Series Preferred Stock so converted were registered, and no such issuance or
delivery shall be made unless and until the person or entity requesting such issuance has paid to
the Corporation the amount of any such tax or hes established, to the satisfaction of the
Corporation, that such tax has been paid.

Common Stock (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto without regard to any provision
contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of
such Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities and Options therefor, the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to be Additional Shares of Common
Stock issued as of the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shal] have been fixed, as
of the close of business on such record date.

(B) If the terms of any Option or Convertible Security, the
issuance of which resulted in an adjustment to the Series A Conversion Price, Series B
Conversion Price or Series C Conversion Price pursuant to the terms of Subsection 4(d)(iv)
below, are revised (either automatically pursuant the provisions contained therein or as a result
of an amendment to such terms) to provide for either (1) any increase or decrease in the number
of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any such
Option or Convertible Security or (2) any increase or decrease in the consideration payable to the
Corporation upon such exercise, conversion or exchange, then, effective upon such increase or
decrease becoming effective, the Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series
C Conversion Price, as the case may be, computed upon the original issue of such Option or
Convertible Security (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto) shall be
readjusted to such Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series C Conversion
Price, as the case may be, as would have obtained had such revised terms been in effect upon the
original date of issuance of such Option or Convertible Security. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
no adjustment pursuant to this clause (B) shall have the effect of increasing the Series A
Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series C Conversion Price, as the case may be,
to an amount which exceeds the lower of (i) such Conversion Price on the original adjustment
date, or (ii) such Conversion Price that would have resulted from any issuances of Additional
Shares of Common Stock between the original adjustment date and such readjustment date.

(C) Ifthe terms of any Option or Convertible Security
(excluding Options or Convertible Securities which, upon exercise, conversion or exchange
thereof, would entitle the holder thereof to receive shares of Common Stock which are
specifically excepted from the definition of Additional Shares of Common Stock by Subsection
4(d)((D) above), the issuance of which did not result in an adjustment to the Series A
Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series C Conversion Price, as the case may be,
pursuant to the terms of Subsection 4(d){iv) below (either because the consideration per share
(determined pursuant to Subsection 4(d)(v) hereof) of the Additional Shares of Common Stock
subject thereto was equal to or greater than the Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion
Price or Series C Conversion Price, as the case may be, then in effect, or because such Option or
Convertible Security was issued before the Original Issue Date), are revised on or after the
Original Issue Date, as the case may be (either automatically pursuant the provisions contained
therein or as a result of an amendment to such terms), to provide for either (1) any increase or
decrease in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or
exchange of any such Option or Convertible Security or (2) any increase or decrease in the
consideration payable to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion or exchange, then such
Option or Convertible Security, as so amended, and the Additional Shares of Common Stock

-12-
USIDOCS $486063v2
subject thereto (determined in the manner provided in Subsection 4(d)(iii)(A) above) shall be
deemed to have been issued effective upon such increase or decrease becoming effective.

(D) Upon the expiration or termination of any unexercised
Option or unconverted or unexchanged Convertible Security which resulted (either upon its
original issuance or upon a revision of its terms) in an adjustment to the Series A Conversion
Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series C Conversion Price pursuant to the terms of
Subsection 4(d)(iv) below, the Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series C
Conversion Price, as the case may be, shall be readjusted to such Series A Conversion Price,
Series B Conversion Price or Series C Conversion Price, as the case may be, as would have
obtained had such Option or Convertible Security never been issued,

(E) No adjustment in the Series A Conversion Price, Series B
Conversion Price or Series C Conversion Price shall be made upon the issue of shares of
Common Stock or Convertible Securities upon the exercise of Options or the issue of shares of
Common Stock upon the conversion or exchange of Convertible Securities.

(iv) Adjustment of Conversion Prices Upon Issuance of Additional

Shares of Common Stock,

(A) In the event the Corporation shall at any time on or after the
Original Issue Date issue Additional Shares of Common Stock (including Additional Shares of
Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to Subsection 4(d)(iii), but excluding shares issued
as a stock split or combination as provided in Subsection 4(e) or upon a dividend or distribution
as provided in Subsection 4(f)),.without consideration or for a consideration per share less than
the Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issue, then and in such event,
such Series A Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price
(calculated to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying such Series A Conversion Price by a
fraction, (A) the numerator of which shall be (1) the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such issue (calculated assuming conversion of all issued and
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock and the exercise, exchange or conversion of all then
outstanding options, warrants or subscription rights) plus (2) the number of shares of Common
Stock which the aggregate consideration received or to be received by the Corporation for the
total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued would purchase at such Series A
Conversion Price; and {B) the denominator of which shal! be the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of such Additional Shares of
Common Stock so issued; provided that, for the purpose of this Subsection 4(d)(iv), all shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series Preferred Stock outstanding immediately
prior to such issue shall be deemed to be outstanding.

(B) In the event the Corporation shall at any time on or after the
Original Issue Date issue Additional Shares of Common Stock (including Additional Shares of
Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to Subsection 4(d)iii), but excluding shares issued
as a stock split or combination as provided in Subsection 4(e) or upon a dividend or distribution
as provided in Subsection 4(f)), without consideration or for a consideration per share less than
the Series B Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issue, then and in such event,
such Series B Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price

-]3-

USIDOCS 5486063¥2
(calculated to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying such Series B Conversion Price by a
fraction, (A) the numerator of which shall be (1) the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such issue (calculated assuming conversion of all issued and
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock and the exercise, exchange or conversion of all then
outstanding options, warrants or subscription rights) plus (2) the number of shares of Common
Stock which the aggregate consideration received or to be received by the Corporation for the
total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued would purchase at such Series B
Conversion Price; and (B) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of such Additional Shares of
Common Stock so issued; provided that, for the purpose of this Subsection 4(d)(iv), all shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series Preferred Stock outstanding immediately
prior to such issue shall be deemed to be outstanding.

(C) Inthe event the Corporation shall at any time on or after the
Original Issue Date issue Additional Shares of Common Stock (including Additional Shares of
Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to Subsection 4(d)(iii), but excluding shares issued
as a stock split or combination as provided in Subsection 4(e) or upon a dividend or distribution
as provided in Subsection 4(f)), without consideration or for a consideration per share less than
the Series C Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issue, then and in such event,
such Series C Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price
(calculated to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying such Series C Conversion Price by a
fraction, (A) the numerator of which shall be (1) the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such issue (calculated assuming conversion of all issued and
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock and the exercise, exchange or conversion of all then
outstanding options, warrants or subscription rights) plus (2) the number of shares of Common
Stock which the aggregate consideration received or to be received by the Corporation for the
total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued would purchase at such Series C
Conversion Price; and (B) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of such Additional Shares of
Common Stock so issued; provided that, for the purpose of this Subsection 4(d)(iv), all shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series Preferred Stock outstanding immediately
prior to such issue shall be deemed to be outstanding.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this
Subsection 4(d), the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional

Shares of Common Stock shall be computed as follows:
(A) Cash and Property: Such consideration shall:

() insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
aggregate amount of cash received by the
Corporation, excluding amounts paid or payable for
accrued interest;

(If) —_ insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair market value thereof at the

-14-

USIDOCS 3486063v2
time of such issue, as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors of the Corporation; and

(II) in the event Additional] Shares of Common Stock
are issued together with other shares or securities or
other assets of the Corporation for consideration
which covers both, be the proportion of such
consideration so received, computed as provided in
clauses (I) and (II) above, as determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors.

(B) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per
share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been

issued pursuant to Subsection 4(d)(iii), relating to Options and Convertible Securities, shall be
determined by dividing:

(1) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by
the Corporation as consideration for the issue of
such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the
minimum aggregate amount of additional
consideration (as set forth in the instruments
relating thereto, without regard to any provision
contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of
such consideration) payable to the Corporation upon
the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the
case of Options for Convertible Securities, the
exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities
and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, by

(iD the maximum number of shares of Common Stock
(as set forth in the instruments relating thereto,
without regard to any provision contained therein
for a subsequent adjustment of such number)
issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities.

(vi) Multiple Closing Dates. In the event the Corporation shall issue on
more than one date Additional Shares of Common Stock which are comprised of shares of the
same series or class of Preferred Stock, and such issuance dates occur within a period of no more
than 120 days, then, upon the final such issuance, the Series A Conversion Price, Series B
Conversion Price and/or the Scrics C Conversion Price, as the case may be, shall be readjusted to
give effect to all such issuances as if they occurred on the date of the final such issuance (and
without giving effect to any adjustments as a result of such prior issuances within such period).

-15-

USIDOCS 5486063¥2
(vii) Pay to Play Provisions.

(A)  If(1) the Corporation issues Additional Shares of Common
Stock (including Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to
Subsection 4(d)(iii), but excluding shares issued as a stock split or combination as provided in
Subsection 4(¢) or upon a dividend or distribution as provided in Subsection 4(f)), without
consideration or for a consideration per share less than the applicable Series C Conversion Price
in effect immediately prior to such issuance (such issuance being referred to herein as a “‘Dilutive
Issuance”), and (2) a holder of Series Preferred Stock (a “Scries Holder”) either (a) has the right,
pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Investor Rights Agreement, dated near or as of
the date of the filing of this Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, among the
Corporation, holders of Series Preferred Stock as of that date and certain other parties thereto
(together with any successor or substitute agreement, and any modifications or amendments
thereto or waivers thereof, the “Investor Agreement”), or is nonetheless given the opportunity,
upon substantially the terms set forth in the Investor Agreement, to purchase its Pro Rata Share
(as defined below) of such Dilutive Issuance or (b) in an offering in which the Board of Directors
of the Corporation (including at least one Series Designee) determines that it is in the best
interests of the Corporation for the Series Holders to purchase a number of Additional Shares of
Common Stock as determined by the Board of Directors of the Corporation, which may
constitute all of the Additional Shares of Common Stock in such offering (a “Mandatory
Offering”), is given the right to purchase its Pro Rata Share of such Mandatory Offering, and
(C) such Series Holder does not purchase its Pro Rata Share of such Dilutive Issuance (other than
as a result of the failure of the Corporation to comply with the terms of Section 3.1 of the
Investor Agreement or otherwise to permit such Series Holder to make such purchase) (such
holder being referred to herein as a “Non-Participating Holder”), then, no later than 15 days
following the closing of such Dilutive Issuance, all shares of Series Preferred Stock held by such
Non-Participating Holder shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock, at the
then effective conversion rate (such conversion shall be referred to herein as a “Special
Mandatory Conversion”).

For purposes of the foregoing, “Pro Rata Share” shall mean the proportionate part of the
Dilutive Issuance that the Scries Holder has the right to purchase pursuant to the Investor
Agreement, taking into account any waiver or modification thereto (including one providing that
the investors’ preemptive rights thereunder apply to only a portion of the Dilutive Issuance)
effected with the requisite consent of the parties, but without taking into account any right to
purchase the proportionate share of other holders who do not elect to purchase their full
proportionate shares as shall be determined based upon the Series Holder’s percentage ownership
of all shares of Series Preferred Stock outstanding.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the terms of this Subsection 4(d)(vii)(B) shall not apply
to a Dilutive Issuance if (i) such Dilutive Issuance involves the same class and series of securities
as a previous Dilutive Issuance that occurred within the prior three months and is effected
pursuant to the same purchase agreement as was such previous Dilutive Issuance or (ii) all rights
of the Series Holders to purchase any portion of the Dilutive Issuance under the Investor
Agreement are waived. In determining whether a Series Holder has purchased its Pro Rata Share
of a Dilutive Issuance for purposes of this Subsection 4(d){vii)(A), any portion of a Dilutive
Issuance purchased by a person or entity that is affiliated with a Series Holder or otherwise

-16-

USIDOCS 3486063+2
approved by the Corporation as a substitute investor for such Series Holder (provided such
person or entity is not also a Series Holder) shall be deemed to have been purchased by such
Series Holder.

(B) All Non-Participating Holders shall be given written notice
of a Special Mandatory Conversion and the place designated for mandatory conversion of all
their shares of Series Preferred Stock pursuant to this Subsection 4(d){vii). Such notice need not
be given in advance of the occurrence of such Special Mandatory Conversion. Such notice shall
be sent by first class or registered mail, postage prepaid, to each Non-Participating Holder, at
such holder's address last shown on the records of the transfer agent for the Series Preferred
Stock (or the records of the Corporation, if it serves as its own transfer agent). Upon receipt of
such notice, each Non-Participating Holder shall surrender his or its certificate or certificates for
all such shares of Series Preferred Stock to the Corporation at the place designated in such
notice, and shall thereafter receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Subsection 4(d)(vii). On the effective date of such
Special] Mandatory Conversion, all rights with respect to the Series Preferred Stock so converted
will terminate, except only the rights of the holders thereof, upon surrender of their certificate or
certificates therefor, to receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which
such Series Preferred Stock has been converted; provided that the right of any Non-Participating
Holder to receive any declared but unpaid dividends on their shares of Series Preferred Stock
shal] accrue to the benefit of the shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of such shares
of Series Preferred Stock. If so required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for
conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by written instrument or instruments of transfer, in
form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or by his or its
attorney duly authorized in writing. As soon as practicable after the effective date of a Special
Mandatory Conversion and the surrender of the certificate or certificates for Series Preferred
Stock the Corporation shall cause to be issued and delivered to such holder, or on his or its
written order, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable
on such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof. All certificates evidencing shares
of Series Preferred Stock which are required to be surrendered for conversion in accordance with
the provisions hereof shall, from and after the effective date of the Special Mandatory
Conversion, be deemed to have been retired and cancelled and the shares of Series Preferred
Stock represented thereby converted into Common Stock notwithstanding the failure of the
holder or holders thereof to surrender such certificates on or prior to such date. Such converted
Series Preferred Stock may not be reissued, and the Corporation may thereafter take such
appropriate action (without the need for stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the
authorized number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stack or Series C
Preferred Stock, as the case may be, accordingly.

(C) If, after the occurrence of a Special Mandatory Conversion,
the Corporation effects an additional Dilutive Issuance and there are Non-Participating Holders
with respect to such Dilutive Issuance, then the provisions of Subsections 4(d)(vii)(A) and
4(d)(vii)(B) above shall apply to such Dilutive Issuance.

(e) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If the Corporation shall at

any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date effect a subdivision of the outstanding
Common Stock, the Series A Conversion Price, Serics B Conversion Price or Series C

-17-

USIOOCS 3486063 v2
Conversion Price, as the case may be, then in effect immediatcly before that subdivision shall be
proportionately decreased. If the Corporation shall at any time or from time to time after the
Original Issue Date combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Series A Conversion
Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series C Conversion Price, as the case may be, then in effect
immediately before the combination shall be proportionately increased. Any adjustment under
this paragraph shall become effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or
combination becomes effective.

(f) Adjustment for Certain Dividends and Distributions. In the event the

Corporation at any time, or from time to time on or after the Original Issue Date, shall make or
issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive,
a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock, then and in each
such event the Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price and Series C Conversion
Price in effect immediately before such event shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance
or, in the event such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such
record date, by multiplying the Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series C
Conversion Price, as the case may be, then in effect by a fraction:

(i) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the
close of business on such record date (calculated assuming conversion of issued and outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock and the exercise, exchange or conversion of all then outstanding
options, warrants or subscription rights), and

(ii) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the
close of business on such record date (calculated assuming conversion of issued and outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock and the exercise, exchange or conversion of all then outstanding
options, warrants or subscription rights) plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in
payment of such dividend or distribution; provided, however, if such record date shall have been
fixed and such dividend is not fully paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed
therefor, the Scries A Conversion Price, the Series B Conversion Price and the Series C
Conversion Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record date
and thereafter the Series A Conversion Price, the Series B Conversion Price and the Series C
Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this paragraph as of the time of actual payment of
such dividends or distributions; and provided further, however, that no such adjustment shall be
made with respect to the Series A Conversion Price, the Series B Conversion Price or the Series
C Conversion Price if the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock or the
Series C Preferred Stock, as the case may be, simultaneously receive (i) a dividend or other
distribution of shares of Common Stock in a number equal to the number of shares of Common
Stock as they would have received if all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, the
Series B Preferred Stock or the Series C Preferred Stock, as the case may be, had been converted
into Common Stock on the date of such event or (ii) a dividend or other distribution of shares of
Series A Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock or the Series C Preferred Stock, as the
case may be, which are convertible, as of the date of such event, into such number of shares of
Common Stock as is equal to the number of additional shares of Common Stock being issued
with respect to each share of Common Stock in such dividend or distribution.

-18-

USIDOCS $486063v2
(g) Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time on or after the Original Issue Date shal] make or

issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive,
a dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the Corporation other than shares of
Common Stock, then and in each such event provision shall be made so that the holders of Series
Preferred Stock shall receive upon conversion thereof in addition to the number of shares of
Common Stock receivable thereupon, the amount of securities of the Corporation that they
would have received if all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Scries B Preferred
Stock or Series C Preferred Stock, as the case may be, had been converted into Common Stock
on the date of such event and had they thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to
and including the conversion date, retained such securities receivable by them as aforesaid
during such period, giving application to all adjustments called for during such period under this
paragraph with respect to the rights of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock, as the case may be; and provided further, however,
that no such adjustment shall be made if the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock, as the case may be, simultaneously receive a
dividend or other distribution of such securities in an amount equal to the amount of such
securities as they would have received if all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock,
Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock, as the case may be, had been converted
into Common Stock on the date of such event.

(h) Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange, or Substitution. If the

Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred
Stock or Series C Preferred Stock, as the case may be, shall be changed into the same or a
different number of shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization,
reclassification, or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares or stock
dividend provided for above, or a reorganization, merger, consolidation, or sale of assets
provided for below), then and in each such event the holder of each such share of Series A
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock, as the case may be, shall
have the right thereafter to convert such share into the kind and amount of shares of stock and
other securities and property receivable, upon such reorganization, reclassification, or other
change, by holders of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series A
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock, as the case may be, might
have been converted immediately prior to such reorganization, reclassification, or change, all
subject to further adjustment as provided herein.

(i) Adjustment for Merger or Reorganization, etc. Subject to the provisions

of Subsection 2(c), if there shall occur any reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
consolidation or merger involving the Corporation in which the Common Stock (but not the
Series A Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock or the Series C Preferred Stock) is
converted into or exchanged for securities, cash or other property (other than a transaction
covered by paragraphs (c), (f) (g) or (h) of this Section 4), then, following any such
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger, each share of Series A
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock, as the case may be, shall
be convertible into the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property which a holder of
the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation issuable upon conversion of one
share of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock, as the

-19.
USIDOCS $486063v2
case may be, immediately prior to such reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
consolidation or merger would have been entitled to receive pursuant to such transaction; and, in
such case, appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation) shall be made in the application of the provisions in this Section 4 with respect to
the rights and interests thereafter of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series B
Preferred Stock or the Series C Preferred Stock, as the case may be, to the end that the provisions
set forth in this Section 4 (including provisions with respect to changes in and other adjustments
of the Series A Conversion Price, the Series B Conversion Price or the Series C Conversion
Price) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any securities
or other property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock,
Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock, as the case may be.

6) No Impairment. The Corporation will not, by amendment of its
Certificate of Incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation,
merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to
avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder
by the Corporation without the written consent of the holders of at least a majority of the then
outstanding shares of the series of Preferred Stock affected, but will at all times in good faith
assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Section 4 and in the taking of all such action
as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the Conversion Rights of the holders of the
Series Preferred Stock against impairment.

(xk) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Series A Conversion Price, the Series B Conversion Price or the Series C
Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation at its expense shall promptly
compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to
each holder of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock, as
the case may be, a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail
the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon the
written request at any time of any holder of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or
Series C Preferred Stock, as the case may be, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a
similar certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and readjustments, (ii) the Series A
Conversion Price, the Series B Conversion Price and/or the Series C Conversion Price then in
effect, and (iii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property
which then would be received upon the conversion of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock and/or Series C Preferred Stock.

() Notice of Record Date. In the event:

(i) that the Corporation declares a dividend (or any other distribution)
on its Common Stock payable in Common Stock or other securities of the Corporation:

(ii) that the Corporation subdivides or combines its outstanding shares
of Common Stock;

(ui) of any reclassification of the Common Stock of the Corporation

or with another corporation, or of the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Corporation; or

(iv) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding
up of the Corporation; then the Corporation shall use reasonable efforts to cause to be filed at its
principal office or at the office of the transfer agent of the Series Preferred Stock, and shall cause

records of the Corporation or such transfer agent, at least ten days prior to the date specified in
(A) below or twenty days before the date specified in (B) below, a notice stating

(A) _ the record date of such dividend, distribution, subdivision
or combination, or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of Common

determined, or

(B) _ the date on which such reclassification, consolidation,
merger, Sale, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to become effective, and the date
as of which it is expected that holders of Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange
their shares of Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such
reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, dissolution or winding up; provided, however, that
the Corporation's failure to provide any notice required under this Section 4(1) after using
reasonable efforts shall not be deemed a default, breach or violation of this Section 4(I).

5. Mandatory Conversion.

(a) Upon the earlier of (i) the closing of the sale of shares of Common Stock,
at a price to the public of at least $3.70 per share (subject to appropriate adjustment for stock

under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, resulting in at least $20,000,000 of proceeds (after
deducting underwriter discounts and commissions) to the Corporation or (ii) a date agreed to in
writing by vote or written consent of the holders of more than 60% of the then outstanding shares

Date”), (i) all outstanding shares of Series Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into
shares of Common Stock, at the then effective conversion rate and (ii) the number of authorized
shares of Series Preferred Stock shall be automatically reduced by the number of shares of Series
Preferred Stock that had been designated as Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock
or Series C Preferred Stock, as the case may be, and all provisions for the Series A Preferred

conversion of all such shares of Series Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 5. Such notice
need not be given in advance of the occurrence of the Mandatory Conversion Date. Such notice
shall be sent by first class or registered mail, postage prepaid, or given by electronic

pursuant to this Section 5. On the Mandatory Conversion Date, all outstanding shares of Series
Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have been converted into shares of Common Stock, which
shall be deemed to be outstanding of record, and all rights with respect to the Series Preferred
Stock so converted, including the rights, if any, tc receive notices and vote (other than as a
holder of Common Stock) will terminate, except only the rights of the holders thereof, upon
surrender of their certificate or certificates therefor, to receive certificates for the number of
shares of Common Stock into which such Series Preferred Stock has been converted, and
payment of any declared but unpaid dividends thereon. Ifso required by the Corporation,
certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by written instrument
or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the
registered holder or by his or its attomey duly authorized in writing. As soon as practicable afier
the Mandatory Conversion Date and the surrender of the certificate or certificates for Series
Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall cause to be issued and delivered to such holder, or on his
or its written order, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock
issuable on such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof and cash as provided in
Subsection 4(b) in respect of any fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon
such conversion.

(c) All certificates evidencing shares of Series Preferred Stock which are
required to be surrendered for conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof shall, from
and after the Mandatory Conversion Date, be deemed to have been retired and cancelled and the
shares of Series Preferred Stock represented thereby converted into Common Stock for all
purposes, notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender such
certificates on or prior to such date. Such converted Series Preferred Stock may not be reissued,
and the Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate action (without the need for
stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Series
Preferred Stock accordingly.

6. Redemption.

(a) Mandatory Redemption; Three Installments. Shares of (i) Series A
Preferred Stock shalt be redeemed by the Corporation at a price equal to $1.00 per share (subject
to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other
recapitalization affecting such Series A Preferred Stock), plus all declared but unpaid dividends
thereon (ii) Series B Preferred Stock shall be redeemed by the Corporation at a price equal to
$1.55 per share (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split,
combination or other recapitalization affecting such Series B Preferred Stock), plus all declared
but unpaid dividends thereon and (iii) Series C Preferred Stock shall be redecmed by the
Corporation at a price equal to $1.8511942 per share (subject to appropriate adjustment in the
event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other recapitalization affecting such
Series C Preferred Stock), plus all declared but unpaid dividends thereon, (with each such
redemption price referred to herein as the “Redemption Price”), in three annual installments
commencing 60 days after receipt by the Corporation at any time on or after the fourth
anniversary of the Original Issue Date, from the holders of more than 60% of the then
outstanding shares of Series Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class, of written notice
requesting redemption of all shares of Series Preferred Stock (the date of each such installment
being referred to as a “Redemption Date”). On each Redemption Date, the Corporation shall
redeem, on a pro rata basis in accordance with the number of shares of Series Preferred Stock
owned by each holder, that number of outstanding shares of Series Preferred Stock determined
by dividing (i) the total number of shares of Series Preferred Stock outstanding immediately
prior to such Redemption Date by (ii) the number of remaining Redemption Dates (including the
Redemption Date to which such calculation applies). If the Corporation does not have sufficient
funds legally available to redeem the Series Preferred Stock on any Redemption Date, the
Corporation shall redeem a pro rata portion of each holder’s shares of Series Preferred Stock out
of funds legally available therefor and shall redeem the remaining shares to have been redeemed
as soon as practicable after the Corporation has funds legally available therefor.

(b) Redemption Notice. Written notice of the mandatory redemption (the
“Redemption Notice”) shall be mailed, postage prepaid, to each holder of record of Series
Preferred Stock at its post office address last shown on the records of the Corporation, or given
by electronic communication in compliance with the provisions of the Delaware General
Corporation Law, not less than 30 days prior to each Redemption Date. Each Redemption
Notice shall state:

(I) the number of shares of Series Preferred Stock held
by the holder that the Corporation shall redeem on
the Redemption Date specified in the Redemption
Notice;

(iI) the Redemption Date and the applicable
Redemption Price;

(III) _ the date upon which the holder’s right to convert
such shares terminates (as determined in accordance
with Section 4(a)); and

-23-

USIDOCS 3486063v2
(iV) that the holder is to surrender to the Corporation, in
the manner and at the place designated, his
certificate or certificates representing the shares of
Series Preferred Stock, as the case may be, to be
redeemed.

(c) Surrender of Certificates; Payment. On or before the applicable
Redemption Date, each holder of shares of Series Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such
Redemption Date, unless such holder has exercised his or its right to convert such shares as
provided in Section 4 hereof, shall surrender the certificate or certificates representing such
shares to the Corporation, in the manner and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice,
and thereupon the applicable Redemption Price for such shares shall be payable to the order of
the person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof, and each
surrendered certificate shall be canceled and retired. In the event less than all of the shares of
Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock, as the case may
be, represented by a certificate are redeemed, a new certificate representing the unredeemed
shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock, as the
case may be, shall promptly be issued to such holder.

(d) Rights Subsequent to Redemption. If the Redemption Notice shall have
been duly given, and if on the applicable Redemption Date the applicable Redemption Price

payable upon redemption of the shares of Series Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such
Redemption Date is paid or tendered for payment, then notwithstanding that the certificates
evidencing any of the shares of Series Preferred Stock so called for redemption shall not have
been surrendered, dividends with respect to such shares of Series Preferred Stock shal] cease to
accrue after such Redemption Date and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith after
the Redemption Date terminate, except only the right of the holders to receive the applicable
Redemption Price without interest upon surrender of their certificate or certificates therefor.

(e) Redeemed or Otherwise Acquired Shares. Any shares of Series Preferred

Stock redeemed pursuant to this Section 6 will be cancelled and will not under any
circumstances be reissued, sold or transferred, and the Corporation may from time to time take
such appropriate action as may be necessary to reduce the authorized Series A Preferred Stock,
Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock, as the case may be, accordingly.

7. Waiver. Any of the rights of the holders of Series Preferred Stock set forth herein
may be waived by the affirmative consent or vote of the holders of shares of Series Preferred
Stock representing more than 60% of the votes represented by the shares of Series Preferred
Stock then outstanding, voting together as a single class, provided such waiver by its terms is
equally applicable to the holders of Series Preferred Stock. Any of the rights of the holders of
Series A Preferred Stock set forth herein may be waived (in a manner that does not apply to the
holders of Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock) by the affirmative consent or
vote of the holders of more than 50% of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding.
Any of the rights of the holders of Series B Preferred Stock set forth herein may be waived (in a
manner that does not apply to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred
Stock) by the affirmative consent or vote of the holders of more than 50% of the shares of Series
B Preferred Stock then outstanding. Any of the rights of the holders of Series C Preferred Stock

-24-
USIDOCS 5486063+2
set forth herein may be waived (in a manner that does not apply to the holders of Series A
Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock) by the affirmative consent or vote of the holders of
more than 60% of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock then outstanding.

FIFTH. In furtherance of and not in limitation of powers conferred by statute, it is
further provided:

1. Election of directors need not be by written ballot.

2. The Board of Directors is expressly authorized to adopt, amend or repeal
the By-Laws of the Corporation.

SUXTH. Except to the extent that the General Corporation Law of Delaware
prohibits the elimination or limitation of liability of directors for breaches of fiduciary duty, no
director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for
monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director, notwithstanding any provision
of law imposing such liability. No amendment to or repeal of this provision shall apply to or
have any effect on the liability or alleged liability of any director of the Corporation for or with
respect to any acts or omissions of such director occurring prior to such amendment.

SEVENTH. 1. Actions, Suits and Proceedings Other than by or in the Right of the
Corporation. The Corporation shall indemnify each person who was or is a party or is threatened

to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the
Corporation), by reason of the fact that he is or was, or has agreed to become, a director or
officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving, or has agreed to serve, at the request of the
Corporation, as a director, officer or trustee of, of in a similar capacity with, another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan) (all
such persons being referred to hereafter as an “Indemnitee”), or by reason of any action alleged
to have been taken or omitted in such capacity, against all expenses (including attorneys’ fees),
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or on
his behalf in connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if he
acted in goad faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best
interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no
reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or
proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its
equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and
in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the
Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to
believe that his conduct was unlawful. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article,
except as set forth in Section 7 below, the Corporation shall not indemnify an Indemnitee
seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by the
Indemnitee unless the initiation thereof was approved by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article, the Corporation shall not
indemnify an Indemnitee to the extent such Indemnitee is reimbursed from the proceeds of
insurance, and in the event the Corporation makes any indemnification payments to an
Indemnitee and such Indemnitee is subsequently reimbursed from the proceeds of insurance,

- 25 -

USIDOCS 5486063v2
such Indemnitee shall promptly refund such indemnification payments to the Corporation to the
extent of such insurance reimbursement.

2. Actions or Suits by or in the Right of the Corporation. The Corporation shall

indemnify any Indemnitce who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any
threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a
judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was, or has agreed to become, a director
or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving, or has agreed to serve, at the request of the
Corporation, as a director, officer or trustee of, or in a similar capacity with, another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan), or by
reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in such capacity, against all expenses
(including attorneys’ fees) and, to the extent permitted by law, amounts paid in settlement
actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection with such action, suit or
proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably
believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, except that no
indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person
shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corpcration unless and only to the extent that the
Court of Chancery of Delaware shal] determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of
such liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and
reasonably entitled to indemnity for such cxpenses (including attorneys’ fees) which the Court of
Chancery of Delaware shall deem proper.

3. Indemnification for Expenses of Successful Party. Notwithstanding the other

provisions of this Article, to the extent that an Indemnitee has been successful, on the merits or
otherwise, in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Sections 1 and 2 of this
Article, or ia defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, or on appeal from any such action,
suil or proceeding, he shall be indemnified against all expenses (including attorneys’ fees)
actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection therewith. Without
limiting the foregoing, if any action, suit or proceeding is disposed of, on the merits or otherwise
(including a disposition without prejudice), without (i) the disposition being adverse to the
Indemnitee, (ti) an adjudication that the Indemnitee was liable to the Corporation, (iii) a plea of
guilty or nolo contendere by the Indemnitee, (iv) an adjudication that the Indemnitee did not act
in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests
of the Corporation, and (v) with respect to any criminal proceeding, an adjudication that the
Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful, the Indemnitee shall be
considered for the purposes hereof to have been wholly successful with respect thereto.

4. Notification and Defense of Claim. As a condition precedent to his right to be
indemnified, the Indemnitee must notify the Corporation in writing as soon as practicable of any
action, suit, proceeding or investigation involving him for which indemnity will or could be
sought. With respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation of which the Corporation is
so notified, the Corporation will be entitled to participate therein at its own expense and/or to
assume the defense thereof at its own expense, with legal counse] reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnitee. After notice from the Corporation to the Indemnitee of its election so to assume
such defense, the Corporation shall not be liable to the Indemnitee for any legal or other
expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such claim, other than as

- 26 -

USIDOCS 54860632
provided below in this Section 4. The Indemnitee shall have the right to employ his own counsel
in connection with such claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred after notice
from the Corporation of its assumption of the defense thereof shall be at the expense of the
Indemnitee unless (i) the employment of counsel by the Indemnitee has been authorized by the
Corporation, (ii) counsel to the Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a
conflict of interest or position on any significant issue between the Corporation and the
Indemnitee in the conduct of the defense of such action or (iii) the Corporation shall not in fact
have employed counsel to assume the defense of such action, in each of which cases the fees and
expenses of counsel for the Indemnitee shall be at the expense of the Corporation, except as
otherwise expressly provided by this Article. The Corporation shall not be entitled, without the
consent of the Indemnitee, to assume the defense of any claim brought by or in the right of the
Corporation or as to which counsel for the Indemnitee shall have reasonably made the conclusion
provided for in clause (ii) above.

5. Advance of Expenses. Subject to the provisions of Section 6 below, in the event
that the Corporation does not assume the defense pursuant to Section 4 of this Article of any
action, suit, proceeding or investigation of which the Corporation receives notice under this
Article, any expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by an Indemnitee in defending a civil
or criminal action, suit, proceeding or investigation or any appeal therefrom shal] be paid by the
Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such matter; provided, however, that the
payment of such expenses incurred by an Indemnitee in advance of the final disposition of such
matter shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to
repay all amounts so advanced in the event that it shall ultimately be determined that the
Indemnitec is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article.
Such undertaking shall be accepted without reference to the financial ability of the Indemnitee to
make such repayment.

6. Procedure for Indemnification. In order to obtain indemnification or
advancement of expenses pursuant to Section 1, 2, 3 or 5 of this Article, the Indemnitee shall
submit to the Corporation a written request, including in such request such documentation and
information as is reasonably available to the Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to
determine whether and to what extent the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification or
advancement of expenses. Any such indemnification or advancement of expenses shall be made
promptly, and in any event within 60 days after receipt by the Corporation of the written request
of the Indemnitee, unless with respect to requests under Section 1, 2 or 5 the Corporation
determines within such 60-day period that the Indemnitee did not meet the applicable standard of
conduct set forth in Section 1 or 2, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made in each
instance by (a) a majority vote of the directors of the Corporation consisting of persons who are
not at that time parties to the action, suit or proceeding in question (‘‘disinterested directors”),
whether or not a quorum, (b) a majority vote of a quorum of the outstanding shares of stock of all
classes entitled to vote for directors, voting as a single class, which quorum shall consist of
stockholders who are not at that time parties to the action, suit or proceeding in question, (c)
independent legal counsel (who may, to the extent permitted by law, be regular legal counsel to
the Corporation), or (d) a court of competent jurisdiction.

-27-

USIDOCS 34860632
7. Remedies. The right to indemnification or advances as granted by this Article
shall be enforceable by the Indemnitee in any court of competent jurisdiction if the Corporation
denies such request, in whole or in part, or if no disposition thereof is made within the 60-day
period referred to above in Section 6. Unless otherwise required by law, the burden of proving
that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses under this
Article shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation to have made a
determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification is proper in the
circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual
determination by the Corporation pursuant to Section 6 that the Indemnitee has not met such
applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the
Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct. The Indemnitee’s expenses
(including attorneys’ fees) incurred in connection with successfully establishing his right to
indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such proceeding shall also be indemnified by the
Corporation.

8. Subsequent Amendment. No amendment, termination or repeal of this Article or
of the relevant provisions of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or any other applicable
laws shall affect or diminish in any way the rights of any Indemnitee to indemnification under
the provisions hereof with respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of
or relating to any actions, transactions or facts occurring prior to the final adoption of such
amendment, termination or repeal.

9. Other Rights. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by this
Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnitee seeking
indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any law (common or
statutory), agreement or vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to
action in his official capacity and as to action in any other capacity while holding office for the
Corporation, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director or officer,
and shall inure to the benefit of the estate, heirs, executors and administrators of the Indemnitee.
Nothing contained in this Article shall be deemed to prohibit, and the Corporation is specifically
authorized to enter into, agreements with officers and directors providing indemnification rights
and procedures different from those set forth in this Article. In addition, the Corporation may, to
the extent authorized from time to time by its Board of Directors, grant indemnification rights to
other employees or agents of the Corporation or other persons serving the Corporation and such
rights may be equivalent to, or greater or less than, those set forth in this Article.

10. Partial Indemnification. If an Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this
Article to indemnification by the Corporation for some or a portion of the expenses (including
attomeys’ fees), judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred
by him or on his behalf in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation and any
appeal therefrom but not, however, for the total amount thereof, the Corporation shall
nevertheless indemnify the Indemnitee for the portion of such expenses (including attomeys’
fees), judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement to which the Indemnitee is entitled.

ll. Insurance. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance, at its expense,
to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another

- 28 -
USIDOCS 5486063v2
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit
plan) against any expense, liability or loss incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of
his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such
person against such expense, liability or loss under the General Corporation Law of Delaware.

12. Merger or Consolidation. If the Corporation is merged into or consolidated with
another corporation and the Corporation is not the surviving corporation, the surviving
corporation shall assume the obligations of the Corporation under this Article with respect to any
action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or relating to any actions, transactions or
facts occuring prior to the date of such merger or consolidation.

13. Savings Clause. If this Article or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any
ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify
each Indemnitee as to any expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts
paid in settlement in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal or administrative, including an action by or in the right of the Corporation, to the fullest
extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article that shall not have been invalidated and
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

14. _ Definitions. Terms used herein and defined in Section 145(h) and Section 145(i)
of the General Corporation Law of Delaware shall have the respective meanings assigned to such
terms in such Section 145(h) and Section 145(i).

15. Subsequent Legislation. If the General Corporation Law of Delaware is amended
after adoption of this Article to expand further the indemnification permitted to Indemnitees,
then the Corporation shal! indemnify such persons to the fullest extent permitted by the General
Corporation Law of Delaware, as so amended.

EIGHTH. The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any
provision contained in this Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, in the
manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute and this Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, and all rights conferred upon stockholders herein are granted subject to this
reservation.
