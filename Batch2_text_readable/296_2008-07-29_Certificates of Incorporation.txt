$2,000,000 of Proceeds reserved for distribution pursuant to paragraph (2) above) shall be
reserved for distribution pursuant to the terms of such Carve-Out Plan. If, upon any such
Liquidation Event, the Proceeds shall be insufficient to make a distribution or reservation for
distribution, as applicable, in full in accordance with the preceding sentence, then the Proceeds

allocated between the holders of Series A-2 Preferred at the time outstanding, on the one hand,
and the Carve-Out Plan, on the other hand, ratably in proportion to the aggregate Proceeds to

Transfer, then each holder of Preferred Stock, each participant in a New Management Plan (if
any) and each participant in a Carve Out Plan (if any) shall be entitled to receive, for each share
of Preferred Stock then held and, if applicable, in accordance with the New Management Plan or
Carve Out Plan, out of the proceeds of such Acquisition or Asset Transfer (inclusive of any
amounts to be paid pursuant to a New Management Plan or a Carve Out Plan), the amount of
cash, securities or other property to which such holder would be entitled to receive in a
Liquidation Event pursuant to Sections 3(a) and 3(b) above.

b. For the purposes of this Section 4: (i) “Acquisition” shal] mean
(A) any consolidation or merger of the Company with or into any other corporation or other
entity or person, or any other corporate reorganization, other than any such consolidation, merger
or reorganization in which the stockholders of the Company immediately prior to such
consolidation, merger or reorganization, continue to hold at least a majority of the voting power
of the surviving entity in substantially the same proportions (or, if the surviving entity is a wholly
owned subsidiary, its parent) immediately after such consolidation, merger or reorganization; or
(B) any transaction or series of related transactions to which the Company is a party in which in
excess of fifty percent (50%) of the Company’s voting power is transferred; provided that an

equity financing purposes in which cash is received by the Company or any successor or

Transfer” shall mean a sale, lease, exclusive license or other disposition of all or substantially all
of the (x) assets of the Company or (y) intellectual property of the Company.

C. In any Acquisition or Asset Transfer, if the consideration to be
received is securities of a corporation or other property other than cash, its value will be deemed
its fair market value as determined in good faith by the Board on the date such determination is
made.

5. CONVERSION RIGHTS.

The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have the following rights with
respect to the conversion of the Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock (the “Conversion
Rights”):

a. Optional Conversion. Subject to and in compliance with the
provisions of this Section 5, any shares of Preferred Stock may, at the option of the holder, be
converted at any time into fully-paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock. The number
of shares of Common Stock to which a holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled upon
conversion shall be the product obtained by multiplying the “Series A Preferred Conversion
Rate” (with respect to Series A Preferred) or the “Series B Preferred Conversion Rate” (with
respect to Series B Preferred) then in effect (determined as provided in Section 5(b)) by the
number of shares of the applicable series of Preferred Stock being converted.
b. Series A Preferred Conversion Rate; Series B Preferred
Conversion Rate. The conversion rate in effect at any time for conversion of the Series A
Preferred (the “Series A Preferred Conversion Rate”) shall be the quotient obtained by dividing
the Original Issue Price of the Series A Preferred by the “Series A Preferred Conversion Price”,
calculated as provided in Section S(c). The conversion rate in effect at any time for conversion
of the Series B Preferred (the “Series B Preferred Conversion Rate”) shall be the quotient
obtained by dividing the Original Issue Price of the Series B Preferred by the “Series B Preferred
Conversion Price’, calculated as provided in Section 5(c).

c. Series A Preferred Conversion Price; Series B Preferred
Conversion Price. The conversion price for the Series A Preferred shall initially be the Original
Issue Price of the Series A Preferred (the “Series A Preferred Conversion Price”). The
conversion price for the Series B Preferred shall initially be the Original Issue Price of the Series
B Preferred (the “Series B Preferred Conversion Price”). Such initial Series A Preferred
Conversion Price and Series B Preferred Conversion Price shall be adjusted from time to time in
accordance with this Section 5. All references to the Series A Preferred Conversion Price or
Series B Preferred Conversion Price herein shal! mean the Series A Preferred Conversion Price
or Series B Preferred Conversion Price as so adjusted. The Series A Preferred Conversion Price
and/or Series B Preferred Conversion Price, as in effect from time to time, shall each be referred
to herein as a “Conversion Price”.

d. Mechanics of Conversion. Each holder of Preferred Stock who
desires to convert the same into shares of Common Stock pursuant to this Section 5 shall
surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Company or
any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the Company at such
office that such holder elects to convert the same. Such notice shall state the number and type of
shares of Preferred Stock being converted. Thereupon, the Company shall promptly issue and
deliver at such office to such holder a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled and shall promptly pay (i) in cash or, to the
extent sufficient funds are not then legally available therefor, in Common Stock (at the Common
Stock’s fair market value determined by the Board as of the date of such conversion), any
declared and unpaid dividends on the shares of Preferred Stock, as applicable, being converted
and (ii) in cash (at the Common Stock’s fair market value determined by the Board as of the date
of conversion) the value of any fractional share of Common Stock otherwise issuable to any
holder of Preferred Stock. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made at the close of
business on the date of such surrender of the certificates representing the shares of Preferred
Stock to be converted, and the person entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable
upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such shares of
Common Stock on such date.

e. Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If at any time
or from time to time on or after the filing date hereof (the “Original Filing Date”) the Company
effects a subdivision of the outstanding Common Stock, each Conversion Price in effect
immediately before that subdivision shall be proportionately decreased. Conversely, if at any
time or from time to time after the Original Filing Date the Company combines the outstanding
shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, each Conversion Price in effect

10
immediately before the combination shall be proportionately increased. Any adjustment under
this Section 5(e) shall become effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or
combination becomes effective.

f. Adjustment for Common Stock Dividends and Distributions.
If at any time or from time to time on or after the Original Filing Date the Company pays to
holders of Common Stock a dividend or other distribution in additional shares of Common Stock
each Conversion Price then in effect shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance, as
provided below:

(1) Each Conversion Price shall be adjusted by multiplying
such Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction:

(a) the numerator of which is the total number of shares
of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance, and

(b) the denominator of which is the total number of
shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance
plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or
distribution;

(2) If the Company fixes a record date to determine which
holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution, each
Conversion Price shall be fixed as of the close of business on such record date and the number of
shares of Common Stock shall be calculated immediately prior to the close of business on such
record date; and

(3) If such record date is fixed and such dividend is not fully
paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, each Conversion Price
shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record date and thereafter
each Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this Section 5(f) to reflect the actual payment
of such dividend or distribution.

g. Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange, Substitution,
Reorganization, Merger or Consolidation. If at any time or from time to time on or after the
Original Filing Date the Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock is
changed into the same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by
recapitalization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or otherwise (other than an Acquisition or
Asset Transfer as defined in Section 4 or a subdivision or combination of shares or stock
dividend provided for elsewhere in this Section 5), in any such event each holder of Preferred
Stock shall then have the right to convert such stock into the kind and amount of stock and other
securities and property receivable upon such recapitalization, reclassification, merger,
consolidation or other change by holders of the maximum number of shares of Common Stock
into which such shares of Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately prior to such
recapitalization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or change, all subject to further
adjustment as provided herein or with respect to such other securities or property by the terms
thereof. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the
provisions of this Section 5 with respect to the rights of the holders of Preferred Stock after the
capital reorganization, to the end that the provisions of this Section 5 (including adjustment of
the each Conversion Price then in effect and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of
the Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event and be as nearly equivalent as practicable.

h. Sale of Shares Below Series A Preferred Conversion Price or
Series B Preferred Conversion Price.

(1) If at any time or from time to time on or after the Original
Filing Date the Company issues or sells, or is deemed by the express provisions of this
Section 5(h) to have issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock (as defined in paragraph
(5) below), other than as provided in Section S(e), 5(f) or 5(g) above, for an Effective Price (as
defined in paragraph (5) below) less than (A) with respect to the Series A Preferred, the then
effective Series A Preferred Conversion Price or (B) with respect to the Series B Preferred, the
then effective Series B Preferred Conversion Price (each, a “Qualifying Dilutive Issuance’),
then and in each such case, the then existing Series A Preferred Conversion Price and/or Series B
Conversion Price, as applicable, shall be reduced, as of the opening of business on the date of
such issue or sale, to a price determined by multiplying the applicable Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such issuance or sale by a fraction:

(a) the numerator of which shall be (A) the number of
shares of Common Stock deemed outstanding (as determined below) immediately prior to such
issue or sale, plus (B) the number of shares of Common Stock which the Aggregate
Consideration (as defined in paragraph (3) below) received or deemed received by the Company
for the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued would purchase at such
then-existing applicable Conversion Price, and

(b) — the denominator of which shall be the number of
shares of Common Stock deemed outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale plus the
total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued.

For the purposes of the preceding sentence, the number of shares of “Common Stock
deemed outstanding” as of a given date shall be the sum of (x) the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding, (y) the number of shares of Common Stock into which the then outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock could be converted if fully converted on the day immediately preceding
the given date, and (z) the number of shares of Common Stock which are issuable upon the
exercise or conversion of all other rights, options and convertible securities outstanding on the
day immediately preceding the given date.

(2) No adjustment shall be made to any Conversion Price in an
amount less than one cent ($0.01) per share. Any adjustment required by this Section 5(h) shall
be rounded to the nearest one cent ($0.01) per share. Any adjustment otherwise required by this
Section 5(h) that is not required to be made due to the preceding two sentences shall be included
in any subsequent adjustment to the applicable Conversion Price.

12
(3) For the purpose of making any adjustment required under
this Section 5(h), the aggregate consideration received by the Company for any issue or sale of
securities (the “Aggregate Consideration’) shall be defined as: (A) to the extent it consists of
cash, the gross amount of cash received by the Company before deduction of any underwriting or
similar commissions, compensation or concessions paid or allowed by the Company in
connection with such issue or sale and without deduction of any expenses payable by the
Company, (B) to the extent it consists of property other than cash, the fair value of that property
as determined in good faith by the Board, and (C) if Additional Shares of Common Stock,
Convertible Securities (as defined in paragraph (4) below) or rights or options to purchase either
Additional Shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities are issued or sold together with
other stock or securities or other assets of the Company for a consideration which covers both,
the portion of the consideration so received that may be reasonably determined in good faith by
the Board to be allocable to such Additional Shares of Common Stock, Convertible Securities or
rights or options.

(4) For the purpose of the adjustment required under this
Section 5(h), if the Company issues or sells (x) Preferred Stock or other stock, options, warrants,
purchase rights or other securities convertible into, Additional Shares of Common Stock (such
convertible stock or securities being herein referred to as “Convertible Securities”) or (y) rights
or options for the purchase of Additional Shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities, and
if the Effective Price of such Additional Shares of Common Stock is less than the Series A
Preferred Conversion Price or the Series B Preferred Conversion Price, as applicable, in each
case the Company shall be deemed to have issued at the time of the issuance of such rights or
options or Convertible Securities the maximum number of Additional Shares of Common Stock
issuable upon exercise or conversion thereof and to have received as consideration for the
issuance of such shares an amount equal to the total amount of the consideration, if any, received
by the Company for the issuance of such rights or options or Convertible Securities plus:

(a) in the case of such rights or options, the minimum
amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon the exercise of such rights or
options; and

(b) in the case of Convertible Securities, the minimum
amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon the conversion thereof (other
than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities);
provided that if the minimum amounts of such consideration cannot be ascertained, but are a
function of antidilution or similar protective clauses, the Company shall be deemed to have
received the minimum amounts of consideration without reference to such clauses.

If the minimum amount of consideration payable to the Company
upon the exercise or conversion of rights, options or Convertible Securities is reduced over time
or on the occurrence or non-occurrence of specified events other than by reason of antidilution
adjustments, the Effective Price shall be recalculated using the figure to which such minimum
amount of consideration is reduced; provided further, that if the minimum amount of
consideration payable to the Company upon the exercise or conversion of such rights, options or
Convertible Securities is subsequently increased, the Effective Price shall be again recalculated
using the increased minimum amount of consideration payable to the Company upon the exercise
or conversion of such rights, options or Convertible Securities.

No further adjustment of any Conversion Price, as adjusted upon
the issuance of such rights, options or Convertible Securities, shall be made as a result of the
actual issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock or the exercise of any such rights or
options or the conversion of any such Convertible Securities. If any such rights or options or the
conversion privilege represented by any such Convertible Securities shall expire without having
been exercised, the applicable Conversion Price as adjusted upon the issuance of such rights,
options or Convertible Securities shall be readjusted to the applicable Conversion Price which
would have been in effect had an adjustment been made on the basis that the only Additional
Shares of Common Stock so issued were the Additional Shares of Common Stock, if any,
actually issued or sold on the exercise of such rights or options or rights of conversion of such
Convertible Securities, and such Additional Shares of Common Stock, if any, were issued or sold
for the consideration actually received by the Company upon such exercise, plus the
consideration, if any, actually received by the Company for the granting of all such rights or
options, whether or not exercised, plus the consideration received for issuing or selling the
Convertible Securities actually converted, plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the
Company (other than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible
Securities) on the conversion of such Convertible Securities, provided that such readjustment
shall not apply to prior conversions of Preferred Stock.

(5) For the purpose of making any adjustment to the
Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock required under this Section 5(h), “Additional Shares of
Common Stock” shall mean all shares of Common Stock issued by the Company or deemed to
be issued pursuant to this Section S5(h) (including shares of Common Stock subsequently
reacquired or retired by the Company), other than:

(a) shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of
the Preferred Stock;

(b) shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities
issued after the Original Filing Date to employees, officers or directors of, or consultants or
advisors to the Company or any subsidiary pursuant to stock purchase or stock option plans or
other arrangements that are approved by the Board;

(c) shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to the
exercise of Convertible Securities outstanding as of the Original Filing Date;

(d) shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities
issued for consideration other than cash pursuant to a merger, consolidation, acquisition, strategic
alliance or similar business combination approved by the Board;

(e) shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities
issued pursuant to any equipment loan or leasing arrangement, real property leasing arrangement
or debt financing from a bank or similar financial institution approved by the Board;

14
(f) shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities
Act’) that results in the conversion of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock into shares of
Common Stock;

(g) shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities
issued as a dividend or distribution on the Series A Preferred or Series B Preferred; and

(h) warrants issued or issuable pursuant to that certain
Series B Preferred Stock and Warrant Purchase Agreement dated on or about the date hereof, by
and among the Company and the purchasers named therein, as the same may be amended from
time to time (the “Purchase Agreement”) and shares of Common Stock issued or issuable upon
exercise of such warrants.

References to Common Stock in the subsections of this clause (5) above shall
mean all shares of Common Stock issued by the Company or deemed to be issued pursuant to
this Section 5(h). The “Effective Price” of Additional Shares of Common Stock shall mean the
quotient determined by dividing the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock issued
or sold, or deemed to have been issued or sold by the Company under this Section 5(h), into the
Aggregate Consideration received, or deemed to have been received by the Company for such
issue under this Section 5(h), for such Additional Shares of Common Stock. In the event that the
number of shares of Additional Shares of Common Stock or the Effective Price cannot be
ascertained at the time of issuance, such Additional Shares of Common Stock shall be deemed
issued immediately upon the occurrence of the first event that makes such number of shares or
the Effective Price, as applicable, ascertainable.

(6) In the event that the Company issues or sells, or is deemed
to have issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock in a Qualifying Dilutive Issuance
(the “First Dilutive Issuance”), then in the event that the Company issues or sells, or is deemed
to have issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock in a Qualifying Dilutive Issuance
other than the First Dilutive Issuance as a part of the same transaction or series of related
transactions as the First Dilutive Issuance (a “Subsequent Dilutive Issuance”), then and in each
such case upon a Subsequent Dilutive Issuance each applicable Conversion Price shall be
reduced to the Conversion Price that would have been in effect had the First Dilutive Issuance
and each Subsequent Dilutive Issuance all occurred on the closing date of the First Dilutive
Issuance.

1. Certificate of Adjustment. In each case of an adjustment or
readjustment of any Conversion Price for the number of shares of Common Stock or other
securities issuable upon conversion of any Preferred Stock, if such series of Preferred Stock is
then convertible pursuant to this Section 5, the Company, at its expense, shall compute such
adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the provisions hereof and shall, upon request,
prepare a certificate showing such adjustment or readjustment, and shall mail such certificate, by
first class mail, postage prepaid, to each registered holder of such series of Preferred Stock so
requesting at the holder’s address as shown in the Company’s books. The certificate shall set
forth such adjustment or readjustment, showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or

15
readjustment is based, including a statement of (i) the consideration received or deemed to be
received by the Company for any Additional Shares of Common Stock issued or sold or deemed
to have been issued or sold, (ii) the applicable Conversion Price at the time in effect, (iit) the
number of Additional Shares of Common Stock and (iv) the type and amount, if any, of other
property which at the time would be received upon conversion of such series of Preferred Stock.
Failure to request or provide such notice shall have no effect on any such adjustment.

j. Notices of Record Date. Upon (i) any taking by the Company of a
record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof
who are entitled to receive any dividend or other distribution, or (ii) any Acquisition or other
capital reorganization of the Company, any reclassification or recapitalization of the capital stock
of the Company, any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into any other corporation,
any Asset Transfer or any voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the
Company, the Company shall mail to each holder of Preferred Stock at least ten (10) days prior
to (x) the record date, if any, specified therein, or (y) if no record date is specified, the date upon
which such action is to take effect (or, in either case, such shorter period approved by the holders
of sixty-five percent (65%) of the outstanding Preferred Stock voting together on an as-converted
basis) a notice specifying (A) the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of
such dividend or distribution and a description of such dividend or distribution, (B) the date on
which any such Acquisition, reorganization, reclassification, transfer, consolidation, merger,
Asset Transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to become effective, and (C)
the date, if any, that is to be fixed as to when the holders of record of Common Stock (or other
securities) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock (or other securities) for
securities or other property deliverable upon such Acquisition, reorganization, reclassification,
transfer, consolidation, merger, Asset Transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up.

k. Automatic Conversion.

(1) Each share of Series A Preferred shall automatically be
converted into shares of Common Stock, based on the then-effective Series A Preferred
Conversion Price, (A) at any time upon the affirmative election of the holders of at least seventy
percent (70%) of the outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred, or (B) immediately upon the
closing of a firmly underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement
under the Securities Act covering the offer and sale of Common Stock for the account of the
Company in which (i) the per share price of the Common Stock to be issued and sold in such
offering multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the closing of such offering results in a product of $200,000,000 or more and (ii) the gross cash
proceeds to the Company (before underwriting discounts, commissions and fees) are at least
$30,000,000. Each share of Series B Preferred shall automatically be converted into shares of
Common Stock, based on the then-effective Series B Preferred Conversion Price, (A) at any time
upon the affirmative election of the holders of at least sixty-five percent (65%) of the outstanding
shares of the Series B Preferred, or (B) immediately upon the closing of a firmly underwritten
public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering
the offer and sale of Common Stock for the account of the Company in which (1) the per share
price of the Common Stock to be issued and sold in such offering multiplied by the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the closing of such offering results in

16
a product of $200,000,000 or more and (ii) the gross cash proceeds to the Company (before
underwriting discounts, commissions and fees) are at least $30,000,000. For the purposes of the
preceding two sentences, the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be outstanding as of
a given date shall be the sum of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding, (y) the
number of shares of Common Stock into which the then outstanding shares of such series of
Preferred Stock could be converted if fully converted on the day immediately preceding the given
date, and (z) the number of shares of Common Stock which are issuable upon the exercise or
conversion of all other rights, options and convertible securities outstanding on the day
immediately preceding the given date. Upon such automatic conversion, any declared and
unpaid dividends shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of Section 5(d).

(2) Upon the occurrence of either of the events specified in
Section 5(k)(1) above, the outstanding shares of the applicable series of Preferred Stock shall be
converted automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or
not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Company or its transfer agent;
provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion unless the certificates evidencing such
shares of Preferred Stock are either delivered to the Company or its transfer agent as provided
below, or the holder notifies the Company or its transfer agent that such certificates have been
lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Company to indemnify the
Company from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates. Upon the occurrence
of such automatic conversion of Preferred Stock, the holders of such shares of Preferred Stock
shall surrender the certificates representing such shares, duly endorsed, at the office of the
Company or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock. Thereupon, there shall be issued and
delivered to such holder promptly at such office and in its name as shown on such surrendered
certificate or certificates, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock
into which the shares of Preferred Stock surrendered were convertible on the date on which such
automatic conversion occurred, and any declared and unpaid dividends shall be paid in
accordance with the provisions of Section 5(d).

I. Special Automatic Conversion. In the event that any holder of
shares of Series A Preferred, or an Affiliate (as defined below) of such holder, does not Fully
Participate (as defined below) in any closing of the Series B Financing (as defined below)
pursuant to the terms set forth in the Purchase Agreement (including the provision of prior
notice), then each share of Series A Preferred held by such holder shall automatically, and
without any further action on the part of such holder, be converted into shares of Common Stock
at the Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the consummation of the first
closing of Series B Financing in which such holder does not Fully Participate, effective upon,
subject to, and concurrently with, such closing of Series B Financing. Each share of Series A
Preferred so converted shall be converted in the manner set forth in Section 5(k) hereof. For
purposes this Section 5(1), the following definitions shall apply:

(1) “Fully Participate” means that a holder of shares of Series
A Preferred has (A) executed the Purchase Agreement on or before August 15, 2008, and (B) at
each Closing (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) under the Purchase Agreement, purchased
its Pro Rata Share (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) of the of the number of Shares (as

17
defined in the Purchase Agreement) set forth in such Election Notice (as defined in the Purchase
Agreement) required thereunder to be purchased at such Closing by such Purchaser.

(2) “Series B Financing” means the transactions contemplated
by the Purchase Agreement.

(3) “Affiliate” means (i) with respect to any holder of capital
stock, any other entity or individual who directly or indirectly, controls, is controlled by or is
under common control with such holder of capital stock, including without limitation any general
partner, managing member, officer or director of such holder of capital stock, any venture capital
fund now or hereafter existing which is controlled by one or more general partners or managing
members of, or shares the same management company with, such holder of capital stock, and (ii)
with respect to any individual that is the holder of capital stock, the estate of such individual if
then deceased or any custodian or trustee of any trust, partnership or limited liability company for
the benefit of, or the ownership interests of which are owned wholly by, such individual holder of
capital stock or any such holder’s Immediate Family Members (as defined below).

(4) “Immediate Family Member” shall mean a_ child,
stepchild, grandchild, parent, stepparent, grandparent, spouse, sibling, mother-in-law, father-in-
law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law, including adoptive
relationships, of an individual holder of capital stock.

m. Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall
be issued upon conversion of Preferred Stock. All shares of Common Stock (including fractions
thereof) issuable upon conversion of more than one share of Preferred Stock by a holder thereof
shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the conversion would result in the
issuance of any fractional share. If, after the aforementioned aggregation, the conversion would
result in the issuance of any fractional share, the Company shall, in lieu of issuing any fractional
share, pay cash equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by the fair market value of one
share of Common Stock (as determined by the Board) on the date of conversion.

n. Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Company
shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common
Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock,
such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock. If at any time the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, the Company will take such corporate
action as may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to
such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.

oO. Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Section 5
shall be in writing and shall be deemed effectively given: (i) upon personal delivery to the party
to be notified, (11) when sent by confirmed electronic mail or facsimile if sent during normal
business hours of the recipient; if not, then on the next business day, (ili) five (5) days after
having been sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or (iv)
one (1) day after deposit with a nationally recognized overnight courier, specifying next day
delivery, with verification of receipt. All notices shall be addressed to each holder of record at
the address of such holder appearing on the books of the Company.

p- Payment of Taxes. The Company will pay all taxes (other than
taxes based upon income) and other governmental charges that may be imposed with respect to
the issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of shares of Preferred Stock,
excluding any tax or other charge imposed in connection with any transfer involved in the issue
and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in which the shares of
Preferred Stock so converted were registered.

6. REDEMPTION.

a. The Company shall be obligated to redeem the Preferred Stock as
follows:

(1) The holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding
shares of Series A Preferred, voting together as a separate class, may require the Company, to the
extent it may lawfully do so, to redeem all of the then outstanding Series A Preferred in a single
installment not prior to the fourth (4") anniversary of the Original Filing Date and not prior to the
Series B Redemption Date (the “Series A Redemption Date’’); provided that the Company shall
receive at least sixty (60) days prior to the Redemption Date written notice of such election of the
Series A Preferred. The holders of at least sixty-five percent (65%) of the then outstanding
shares of Series B Preferred, voting together as a separate class, may require the Company, to the
extent it may lawfully do so, to redeem all of the then outstanding Series B Preferred in a single
installment not prior to the fourth (4"") anniversary of the Original Filing Date (the “Series B
Redemption Date”, and referred to with the “Series A Redemption Date” as a “Redemption
Date”); provided that the Company shall receive at least sixty (60) days prior to the Redemption
Date written notice of such election of the Series B Preferred. The Company shall effect such
redemption on the applicable Redemption Date by paying in cash in exchange for the shares of
Preferred Stock a sum equal to the Original Issue Price per share of the series of Preferred Stock
being redeemed plus declared and unpaid dividends (as applicable) with respect to such shares.
The total amount to be paid for each series of Preferred Stock is hereinafter referred to as the
applicable “Redemption Price.” Shares of Series B Preferred subject to redemption pursuant to
this Section 6(a) shall be redeemed from each holder of Series B Preferred on a pro rata basis,
based on the number of shares of Series B Preferred then held. Shares of Series A Preferred
subject to redemption pursuant to this Section 6(a) shall be redeemed from each holder of Series
A Preferred on a pro rata basis, based on the number of shares of Series A Preferred then held,
subject to the prior redemption or conversion of all shares of Series B Preferred.

(2) At least thirty (30) days but no more than sixty (60) days
prior to each Redemption Date, the Company shall send a notice (a “Redemption Notice”) to all
holders of the series of Preferred Stock to be redeemed setting forth (A) the Redemption Price for
the shares to be redeemed; and (B) the place at which such holders may obtain payment of the
Redemption Price upon surrender of their share certificates. If the Company does not have
sufficient funds legally available to redeem all shares to be redeemed, then it shall so notify such

19
holders and shall redeem such shares pro rata (based on the portion of the aggregate Redemption
Price payable to them) to the extent possible and shall redeem the remaining shares to be
redeemed as soon as sufficient funds are legally available.

b. On or prior to a Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit the
Redemption Price of all shares to be redeemed with a bank or trust company having aggregate
capital and surplus in excess of $100,000,000, as a trust fund, with irrevocable instructions and
authority to the bank or trust company to pay, on and after such Redemption Date, the
Redemption Price of the shares to their respective holders upon the surrender of their share
certificates. Any moneys deposited by the Company pursuant to this Section 6(b) for the
redemption of shares thereafter converted into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 5
hereof no later than the fifth (Sth) day preceding the applicable Redemption Date shall be
returned to the Company forthwith upon such conversion. The balance of any funds deposited by
the Company pursuant to this Section 6(b) remaining unclaimed at the expiration of one (1) year
following the applicable Redemption Date shall be returned to the Company promptly upon its
written request.

c. On or after the applicable Redemption Date, each holder of shares
of Preferred Stock shall surrender such holder’s certificates representing such shares to the
Company in the manner and at the place designated in the applicable Redemption Notice, and
thereupon the Redemption Price of such shares shall be payable to the order of the person whose
name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof and each surrendered
certificate shall be canceled. In the event less than all the shares represented by such certificates
are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares. From and
after the Redemption Date, unless there shall have been a default in payment of the Redemption
Price or the Company is unable to pay the Redemption Price due to not having sufficient legally
available funds, all rights of the holder of such shares as holder of the applicable series of
Preferred Stock (except the right to receive the Redemption Price without interest upon surrender
of their certificates), shall cease and terminate with respect to such shares; provided that in the
event that shares of Preferred Stock are not redeemed due to a default in payment by the
Company or because the Company does not have sufficient legally available funds, such shares
of Preferred Stock shall remain outstanding and shall be entitled to all of the rights and
preferences provided herein until redeemed.

d. In the event of a call for redemption of any shares of Preferred
Stock, the Conversion Rights (as defined in Section 5) for such series of Preferred Stock shall
terminate as to the shares designated for redemption at the close of business on the last business
day preceding the applicable Redemption Date, unless default is made in payment of the
applicable Redemption Price.

7. No REISSUANCE OF PREFERRED STOCK.

No shares or shares of Preferred Stock acquired by the Company by reason of
redemption, purchase, conversion or otherwise shall be reissued.

V.

20
A. The liability of the directors of the Company for monetary damages shall be
eliminated to the fullest extent under applicable law.

B. Any repeal or modification of this Article V shall only be prospective and shall
not affect the rights under this Article V in effect at the time of the alleged occurrence of any
action or omission to act giving rise to liability.

C, In the event that a member of the Board who is also a partner or employee of an
entity that is a holder of Preferred Stock and that is in the business of investing and reinvesting in
other entities, or an employee of an entity that manages such an entity (each, a “Fund’”) acquires
knowledge of a potential transaction or other matter in such individual’s capacity as a partner or
employee of the Fund or the manager or general partner of the Fund (and other than directly in
connection with such individual’s service as a member of the Board) and that may be an
opportunity of interest for both the Company and such Fund (a “Corporate Opportunity”), then
the Company (i) renounces any expectancy that such director or Fund offer an opportunity to
participate in such Corporate Opportunity to the Company and (ii) to the fullest extent permitted
by law, waives any claim that such opportunity constituted a Corporate Opportunity that should
have been presented by such director or Fund to the Company or any of its affiliates; provided,
however, that such director acts in good faith.

VI.

For the management of the business and for the conduct of the affairs of the Company,
and in further definition, limitation and regulation of the powers of the Company, of its directors
and of its stockholders or any class thereof, as the case may be, it is further provided that:

A. The management of the business and the conduct of the affairs of the Company
shall be vested in its Board. The number of directors which shall constitute the whole Board
shall be fixed by the Board in the manner provided in the Company’s Bylaws, subject to any
restrictions which may be set forth in this Third Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation.

B. The Board is expressly empowered to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the
Company. The stockholders shall also have the power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of
the Company; provided however, that, in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series
of stock of the Company required by law or by this Third Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all
of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in
the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to adopt, amend or
repeal any provision of the Bylaws of the Company.

Cc. The directors of the Company need not be elected by written ballot unless the
Company’s Bylaws so provide.
