corporation shall be as follows:

of stock to be designated, respectively, common stock and preferred stock. The total number of
shares that this corporation is authorized to issue is Sixteen Million (16,000,000). The total
number of shares of common stock authorized to be issued is Nine Million Six Hundred

“Common Stock”). The total number of shares of preferred stock authorized to be issued is Six
Million Three Hundred Twenty-One Thousand One Hundred Thirty-Four (6,321,134), par value
$0.0001 per share (the “Series Al Preferred Stock”), all of which are designated as “Series Al
Preferred Stock.”

B. Rights, Preferences and Restrictions of Series Al Preferred Stock. The
rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to and imposed on the Series Al Preferred
Stock are as set forth below in this Article [V(B).

1. Dividend Provisions.

(a) Series Al Preferred Stock Dividends. The hoiders of shares of Series Al

Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive dividends (“Series Al Accruing Dividends”), out of
any assets legally available therefor, prior and in preference to any declaration or payment of any

GDSVF&H\1004150. 1 2
dividend (payable other than solely in Common Stock) on the Common Stock of this
corporation, at the Series Al Dividend Rate (as defined below), compounded annually. Such
dividends shall be cumulative and shail accrue on each share of Series Al Preferred Stock from
day to day, whether or not earned or declared. For purposes of this subsection 1(a), “Series Al
Dividend Rate” shall mean $0.06 per annum for each share of Series Al Preferred Stock (as
adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, subdivisions, recapitalizations or the
like occurring after the Recapitalization) and shall be increased by an amount which is the
product of 6% multiplied by the quotient of (i) the aggregate cash contributions made by the
holders of Series Al Preferred Stock to this corporation after the date hereof and up to an
aggregate of $4,900,000 divided by (ii) the number of outstanding shares of Series Al Preferred
Stock (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, subdivisions,
recapitalizations or the like occurring after the Recapitalization).

(b) After payment of the Series Al Accruing Dividends to the holders of the
Series Al Preferred Stock, any additional dividends or distributions shall be distributed among
all holders of Common Stock and Series Al Preferred Stock in proportion to the number of
shares of Common Stock that would be held by each such holder if all shares of Series Al
Preferred Stock were converted to Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of subsection 4(a)
hereof (without giving effect to the issuance of Common Stock in such conversion pursuant to
clause (ii) of the first sentence of subsection 4(a)).

2. Liquidation Preference.

(a) In the event of any Liquidation Event (as defined below), either voluntary
or involuntary, the holders of Series Al Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, prior and in
preference to any distribution of the proceeds of such Liquidation Event (the “Proceeds”) to the
holders of Common Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount per share equal to the
sum of (i) the Series Al Liquidation Amount (as defined below), (ii) all unpaid Series Al
Accruing Dividends, whether or not declared, plus (iii) declared but unpaid dividends on such
shares pursuant to subsection 1(b); provided, however, that if, upon the occurrence of a
Liquidation Event, either voluntary or involuntary, the Proceeds to be distributed among the
holders of the Series Al Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such
holders of the full aforesaid preferential amounts, then the entire Proceeds legally available for
distribution shall be distributed ratably among the holders of the Series Al Preferred Stock in
accordance with the shares of Series Al Preferred Stock held by such holders. For purposes of
this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, “Series Al Liquidation Amount”
shall mean $1.00 per share for each share of the Series Al Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any
stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, subdivisions, recapitalizations or the like occurring
after the Recapitalization) and shall be increased by an amount which is the quotient of (i) the
aggregate cash contributions made by the holders of Series Al Preferred Stock to this
corporation after the date hereof and up to an aggregate of $4,900,000 divided by (ii) the number
of outstanding shares of Series Al Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock
dividends, combinations, subdivisions, recapitalizations or the like occurring after the
Recapitalization).

(b) Upon completion of the distribution required by subsection (a) of this
Section 2, all of the remaining Proceeds shall be distributed among the holders of Series Al

GDSVF&H\1004150.1 3
Preferred Stock and Common Stock pro rata based on the number of shares of Common Stock
held by each (assuming full conversion of all such Series Al Preferred Stock pursuant to the
provisions of subsection 4(a) hereof).

(c) Notwithstanding the above, for purposes of determining the amount each
holder of shares of Series Al Preferred Stock is entitled to receive with respect to a Liquidation
Event, such amount shall not include all unpaid Series Al Accruing Dividends if, upon such
Liquidation Event, such holders of Series Al Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive pursuant
to subsections 1(a) and 1(b) above, excluding amounts attributable to any unpaid Series Al
Accruing Dividends, an aggregate amount of at least three (3) times the Series Al Liquidation
Amount per share of Series A1 Preferred Stock.

(J) @ For purposes of this Section 2, a “Liquidation Event” shall include
(A) the closing of the sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of this
corporation’s assets, (B) the consummation of the merger or consolidation of this corporation
with or into another entity (except a merger or consolidation in which the holders of capital stock
of this corporation immediately prior to such merger or consolidation continue to hold at least
50% of the voting power of the capital stock of this corporation or the surviving or acquiring
entity), (C) the closing of the transfer (whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise), in one
transaction or a series of related transactions, to a person or group of affiliated persons (other
than an underwriter of this corporation’s securities), of this corporation’s securities if, after such
closing, such person or group of affiliated persons would hold 50% or more of the outstanding
voting stock of this corporation (or the surviving or acquiring entity) or (D) a liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of this corporation; provided, however, that a transaction shall not
constitute a Liquidation Event if its sole purpose is to change the state of this corporation’s
incorporation or to create a holding company that will be owned in substantially the same
proportions by the persons who held this corporation’s securities immediately prior to such
transaction. Notwithstanding the prior sentence, the sale of shares of Series Al Preferred Stock
in a financing transaction shall not be deemed a “Liquidation Event.” The treatment of any
particular transaction or series of related transactions as a Liquidation Event may be waived by
the vote or written consent of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding Series Al Preferred
Stock.

(i) In any Liquidation Event, if Proceeds received by this corporation
or its stockholders is other than cash, its value will be deemed its fair market value. Fair market
value for this purpose shall be calculated as follows:

(A) Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar
restrictions on free marketability covered by (B) below:

(1) If traded on a securities exchange or through the
Nasdaq National Market, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the
securities on such exchange or system over the twenty (20) trading-day period ending three (3)
trading days prior to the closing of the Liquidation Event,

(2) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall
be deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the

GDSVF&H\10041 50.1 4
twenty (20) trading-day period ending three (3) trading days prior to the closing of the
Liquidation Event; and

(3) ‘If there is no active public market, the value shall be
the fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Board of Directors of this
corporation and the holders of at least two-thirds of the then outstanding shares of Series Al
Preferred Stock.

(B) The method of valuation of securities subject to investment
letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of
a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount
from the market value determined as above in (A) (1), (2) or (3) to reflect the approximate fair
market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Board of Directors of this corporation and
the holders of at least two-thirds of the then outstanding shares of Series Al Preferred Stock.

(C) The foregoing methods for valuing non-cash consideration
to be distributed in connection with a Liquidation Event may be superceded by any
determination of such value set forth in the definitive agreements governing such Liquidation
Event.

(ii) In the event the requirements of this Section 2 are not complied
with, this corporation shal! forthwith either:

(A) cause the closing of such Liquidation Event to be
postponed until such time as the requirements of this Section 2 have been complied with; or

(B) cancel such transaction, in which event the rights,
preferences and privileges of the holders of the Series Al Preferred Stock shall revert to and be
the same as such rights, preferences and privileges existing immediately prior to the date of the
first notice referred to in subsection 2(d)(iv) hereof.

(iii) This corporation shall give each holder of record of Series Al
Preferred Stock written notice of such impending Liquidation Event not later than twenty (20)
days prior to the stockholders’ meeting called to approve such transaction, or twenty (20) days
prior to the closing of such transaction, whichever is earlier, and shall aiso notify such holders in
writing of the final approval of such transaction. The first of such notices shall describe the
material terms and conditions of the impending transaction and the provisions of this Section 2,
and this corporation shall thereafter give such holders prompt notice of any material changes.
The transaction shall in no event take place sooner than twenty (20) days after this corporation
has given the first notice provided for herein or sooner than ten (10) days after this corporation
has given notice of any material changes provided for herein; provided, however, that subject to
compliance with the General Corporation Law such periods may be shortened or waived upon
the written consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the then outstanding shares of Series
Al Preferred Stock.

GDSVF&H\1004 150.1 5
3, Redemption.

(a) This corporation will, to the extent it may lawfully do so and subject to the
conditions set forth below, within ninety (90) days after the receipt by this corporation of a
written request from the holders of at least two-thirds of the then outstanding Series Al Preferred
Stock made on or after February 17, 2012 that all of the then outstanding shares of Series Al
Preferred Stock be redeemed, redeem in three (3) annual installments (each payment date being
referred to herein as a “Redemption Date”) the then outstanding shares of Series Al Preferred
Stock by paying in cash therefor a sum per share (the “Redemption Price”) equal to the greater of
(A) (i) the Series Al Liquidation Amount plus (ii) all Series Al Accruing Dividends accrued but
unpaid thereon, whether or not declared, plus (iii) any other declared but unpaid dividends on
such shares pursuant to subsection 1(b) or (B) the applicable Fair Market Value (as defined
below). The number of shares of Series Al Preferred Stock that this corporation shall be
required to redeem on any one Redemption Date shall be equal to the amount determined by
dividing (i) the aggregate number of shares of Series Al Preferred Stock outstanding
immediately prior to such Redemption Date by (ii) the number of remaining Redemption Dates
(including the Redemption Date to which such calculation applies). Any redemption of Series
Al Preferred Stock effected pursuant to this subsection 3(a) shall be made on a pro rata basis
among the holders of Series Al Preferred Stock in proportion to the aggregate Redemption Price
each such holder of Series Al Preferred Stock would otherwise be entitled to receive on the
applicable Redemption Date. For purposes of this Section 3, the “Series Al F air Market Value”
shall mean the fair market value of a share of Series Al Preferred Stock as of the date of the
written notice delivered pursuant to subsection 3(b) as determined by the Board of Directors of
this corporation and two-thirds of the then outstanding shares of Series Al Preferred Stock. If
such parties cannot agree on the Series Al Fair Market Value, the fair market value of a share of
Series Al Preferred Stock shall be determined by an appraiser (the “Appraiser”) who is a senior
member of the American Society of Appraisers experienced in the appraisal of software
companies or a nationally recognized investment banker who is an NASD member and is
experienced in the appraisal of software companies. The Series Al Fair Market Value shall be
calculated by the Appraiser without regard for any restrictions on liquidity or the nature of any
minority interest, but shall reflect the relative rights and privileges of the Series Al Preferred
Stock. The fees of the Appraiser shall be paid by this corporation. The Series Al Fair Market
Value pursuant to this subsection 3(a) shall be determined within sixty (60) days of the date of
the redemption request.

(b) At least fifteen (15) but no more than thirty (30) days prior to each
Redemption Date, written notice shall be mailed, first class postage prepaid, to each holder of
record (at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is
given) of Series Al Preferred Stock, at the address last shown on the records of this corporation
for such holder, notifying such holder of the redemption to be effected on the applicable
Redemption Date, specifying the number of the shares of Series Al Preferred Stock to be
redeemed from such holder, the Redemption Price and the place at which payment may be
obtained and calling upon such holder to surrender to this corporation, in the manner and at the
place designated, his, her or its certificate or certificates representing the shares to be redeemed
(the “Redemption Notice”). Except as provided in subsection (3)(c), on or after each
Redemption Date, each holder of Series Al Preferred Stock on such Redemption Date shall
surrender to this corporation the certificate or certificates representing such shares, in the manner

GDSVF&H\1004 150.1 6
and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice, and thereupon the applicable Redemption
Price of such shares shall be payable to the order of the person whose name appears on such
certificate or certificates as the owner thereof and each surrendered certificate shall be cancelled.
In the event less than all the shares represented by any such certificate are redeemed, a new
certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares.

(c) From and after each Redemption Date, unless there shall have been a
default in payment of the Redemption Price, all rights of the holders of shares of Series Al
Preferred Stock designated for redemption on such Redemption Date in the Redemption Notice
as holders of Series Al Preferred Stock (except the right to receive the applicable Redemption
Price without interest upon surrender of their certificate or certificates) shall cease with respect to
such shares, and such shares shall not thereafter be transferred on the books of this corporation or
be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose whatsoever. If the funds of this corporation legally
available for redemption of shares of Series Al Preferred Stock on a Redemption Date are
insufficient to redeem the total number of shares of Series Al Preferred Stock to be redeemed on
such date, those funds that are legally available will be used to redeem the maximum possible
number of such shares ratably among the holders of such shares to be redeemed in proportion to
the aggregate Redemption Price that each such holder would be entitled to receive pursuant to
Section 3(a). The shares of Series Al Preferred Stock not redeemed shall remain outstanding
and entitled to all the rights and preferences provided herein (including the right to Accruing
Dividends which shall continue to accrue and compound until such shares of Series Al Preferred
Stock are redeemed). At any time thereafter when additional funds of this corporation are legally
available for the redemption of shares of Series Al Preferred Stock, such funds will immediately
be used to redeem the balance of the shares that this corporation has become obliged to redeem
on any Redemption Date but that it has not redeemed.

(d) On or prior to each Redemption Date, this corporation shall deposit the
Redemption Price of all shares of Series Al Preferred Stock designated for redemption on such
Redemption Date in the Redemption Notice, and not yet redeemed or converted, with a bank or
trust corporation having aggregate capital and surplus in excess of $100,000,000 as a trust fund
for the benefit of the respective holders of the shares designated for redemption and not yet
redeemed, with irrevocable instructions and authority to the bank or trust corporation to publish
the notice of redemption thereof and pay the Redemption Price for such shares to their respective
holders on or after the Redemption Date, upon receipt of notification from this corporation that
such holder has surrendered his, her or its share certificate to this corporation pursuant to
subsection (3)(b) above. As of the date of such deposit (even if prior to the Redemption Date),
the deposit shall constitute full payment of such shares to their holders, and from and after the
date of the deposit, the shares so called for redemption shall be redeemed and shall be deemed to
be no longer outstanding, and the holders thereof shall cease to be stockholders with respect to
such shares and shall have no rights with respect thereto except the rights to receive from the
bank or trust corporation payment of the Redemption Price for the shares, without interest, upon
surrender of their certificates therefor. Such instructions shall also provide that any moneys
deposited by this corporation pursuant to this subsection (3)(d) for the redemption of shares
which are subsequently converted into shares of this corporation’s Common Stock pursuant to
Article IV(B)(4) hereof prior to the Redemption Date shall be returned to this corporation
forthwith upon such conversion. The balance of any moneys deposited by this corporation
pursuant to this subsection (3)(d) remaining unclaimed at the expiration of two (2) years

GDSVF&H\1004150.1 7
following any such Redemption Date shall thereafter be returned to this corporation upon its
request expressed in a resolution of its Board of Directors.

4. Conversion. The holders of the Series Al Preferred Stock shall have
conversion rights as follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Series Al Preferred Stock shall be
convertible, as provided in subsection 4(b), at any time after the date of issuance of such share
and on or prior to the fifth day prior to the Redemption Date, if any, as may have been fixed in
any Redemption Notice with respect to such share of the Series Al Preferred Stock, and without
payment of any additional consideration thereof, at the office of this corporation or any transfer
agent for such stock, into the sum of (i) such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Series Al Original Issue Price (as defined
below) by the Series Al Conversion Price, determined as hereafter provided, in effect on the date
the certificate is surrendered for conversion. The initial Series Al Conversion Price per share for
the Series Al Preferred Stock shall be the Series Al Original Issue Price; provided, however,
that the Series Al Conversion Price for the Series Al Preferred Stock shall be subject to
adjustment as set forth in subsection 4(d). “Series Al Original Issue Price” shall mean
$0.022608 per share for each share of the Series Al Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any stock
splits, stock dividends, combinations, subdivisions, recapitalizations or the like occurring after
the Recapitalization).

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Series Al Preferred Stock shall
automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock into which such Series Al Preferred
Stock is convertible pursuant to subsection 4(a) immediately upon the earlier of (i) this
corporation’s sale of its Common Stock in a firm commitment underwritten public offering
pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
(A) the public offering price of which was not less than three (3) times the Series Al Liquidation
Amount per share, (B) the net proceeds of which were not less than $25,000,000 and (C) after
which the Common Stock of this corporation is listed on the New York Stock Exchange or the
Nasdaq Global Market (a “Qualified Public Offering”) or (ii) the date specified by written
consent or agreement of the holders of two-thirds of the then outstanding shares of Series Al
Preferred Stock.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. On or after the date of occurrence of any
conversion of Series Al Preferred Stock pursuant to subsection 4(b), and in any event within ten
(10) days after receipt of notice, by mail, postage prepaid from this corporation of the occurrence
of such event, each holder of record of shares of Series Al Preferred Stock being converted shall
surrender such holder’s certificates evidencing such shares at the office of this corporation or of
any transfer agent for the Series Al Preferred Stock specified by this corporation, and shall
thereupon be entitled to receive certificates evidencing the number of shares of Common Stock
into which such shares of Series Al Preferred Stock are converted and cash as provided in
subsection 4(g) in respect of any fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon
such conversion. On the date of the occurrence of any conversion of Series Al Preferred Stock
pursuant to Section 4{b), each holder of record of shares of Series Al Preferred Stock shall be
deemed to be the holder of record of the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion,
notwithstanding that the certificates representing such shares of Series Al Preferred Stock shall

GDS VF&H\1004150. 1 8
not have been surrendered to this corporation, that notice from this corporation shall not have
been received by any holder of record of shares of Series Al Preferred Stock or that the
certificates evidencing such shares of Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered to such
holder.

(d) Series Al Conversion Price Adjustments of Series Al Preferred Stock for
Certain Dilutive Issuances, Splits and Combinations. The Series Al Conversion Price of the
Series Al Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

(i) (A) If this corporation shall issue, on or after the date upon which
this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation is accepted for filing by the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the “Filing Date”), any Additional Stock (as defined
below) without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Series Al Conversion
Price in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock, the Series Al
Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall forthwith (except as
otherwise provided in this clause (i)) be adjusted to a price determined by multiplying the Series
Al Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Stock Outstanding (as defined below) immediately prior to such issuance plus the
number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received by this corporation
for such issuance would purchase at Series Al Conversion Price; and the denominator of which
shall be the number of shares of Common Stock Outstanding (as defined below) immediately
prior to such issuance plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock. For purposes of this
Section 4(d)(i)(A), the term “Common Stock Outstanding” shall mean and include the following:
(1) outstanding Common Stock, (2) Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series Al
Preferred Stock issued or issuable pursuant to that certain Series Al Preferred Stock Purchase
Agreement, dated on or about the Filing Date, (3) Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
stock options issued under this corporation’s 2003 Stock Plan (the “2003 Stock Plan”) and (4)
Common Stock issuable upon exercise (and, in the case of warrants, if any, to purchase Preferred
Stock, conversion) of warrants. Shares described in (1) through (4) above shall be included
whether vested or unvested, whether contingent or non-contingent and whether exercisable or
not yet exercisable.

(A) No adjustment of the Series Al Conversion Price shall be
made in an amount less than $.00001 per share, provided that any adjustments that are not
required to be made by reason of this sentence shall be carried forward and shall be either taken
into account in any subsequent adjustment made prior to three (3) years from the date of the
event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward, or shall be made at the end of three (3)
years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward. Except to
the limited extent provided for in subsections (E)(3) and (E)(4), no adjustment of the Series Al
Conversion Price pursuant to this subsection 4(d)(i) shall have the effect of increasing the Series
Al Conversion Price above the Series Al Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the
adjustment, however, that in no event will the Series Al Conversion Price be increased above the
Series Al Conversion Price in effect on the original issuance date of the Series Al Preferred
Stock.

(B) Inthe case of the issuance of Additional Stock for cash, the
consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting any

GDSVF&H\1004150.1 9
‘reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by this
corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

(C) In the case of the issuance of the Additional Stock for a
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be
deemed to be the fair market value thereof as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors
of this corporation, or if the holders of at least two-thirds of the then outstanding Series A}
Preferred Stock request, as determined by independent accountants of recognized standing
promptly selected by this corporation to value such property, whereupon such value shall be
given to such consideration and shal! be recorded on the books of this corporation with respect to
receipt of such property. In the case of the issuance of the Additional Stock together with other
shares or securities or other assets of this corporation for consideration which covers both, the
consideration for such Additional Stock shall be deemed to be the proportion of such
consideration received for such Additional Stock computed as provided in subsection (C) and
this subsection (D), as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(D) In the case of the issuance of options to purchase or rights
to subscribe for Common Stock, securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for
Common Stock or options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or
exchangeable securities, the following provisions shall apply for purposes of determining the
number of shares of Additional Stock issued and the consideration paid therefor:

(1) The aggregate maximum number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable upon exercise (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to
exercisability, including without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account
potential antidilution adjustments) of such options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common
Stock shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such options or rights were issued and for
a consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in subsections
4(d)(i)(C) and (d)(i)(D)), if any, received by this corporation upon the issuance of such options
or rights plus the minimum exercise price provided in such options or rights (without taking into
account potential antidilution adjustments) for the Common Stock covered thereby.

(2) The aggregate maximum number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of, or in exchange (assuming the satisfaction of any
conditions to convertibility or exchangeability, including, without limitation, the passage of time,
but without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) for, any such convertible or
exchangeable securities or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for
such convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof shall
be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or such options or rights
were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration, if any, received by this
corporation for any such securities and related options or rights (excluding any cash received on
account of accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the minimum additional consideration, if
any, to be received by this corporation (without taking into account potential antidilution
adjustments) upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or the exercise of any related
options or rights (the consideration in each case to be determined in the manner provided in
subsections 4(d)(i)(C) and (d)(i)(D)).

GDSVF&H\1004150.1 10
(3) In the event of any change in the number of shares
of Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to this corporation upon exercise
of such options or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such convertible or
exchangeable securities, the Series Al Conversion Price for the Series Al Preferred Stock, to the
extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, rights or securities, shall be
recomputed to reflect such change, but no further adjustment shall be made for the actual
issuance of Common Stock or any payment of such consideration upon the exercise of any such
options or rights or the conversion or exchange of such securities.

(4) Upon the expiration of any such options or rights,
the termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options or
tights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Series Al Conversion Price for
the Series Al Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such
options, rights or securities or options or rights related to such securities, shall be recomputed to
reflect the issuance of only the number of shares of Common Stock (and convertible or
exchangeable securities that remain in effect) actually issued upon the exercise of such options or
rights, upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or upon the exercise of the options or
rights related to such securities.

(5) | The number of shares of Additional Stock deemed
issued and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to subsections 4(d)(i)(E)(1) and (2)
shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or expiration of the type
described in either subsection 4(d)(i)(E)(3) or (4).

(ii) | “Additional Stock” shall mean any shares of Common Stock
issued (or deemed to have been issued pursuant to subsection 4(d)(i)(E)) by this corporation on
or after the Filing Date other than:

(A) Common Stock issued pursuant to a transaction described
in subsection 4(d)(iii) hereof;

(B) upto 2,047,088 shares of Common Stock (as adjusted for
any stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, subdivisions, recapitalizations or the fike
occurring after the Recapitalization) issued to employees, directors, consultants and other service
providers for the primary purpose of soliciting or retaining their services pursuant to the 2003
Stock Plan;

(C) Common Stock issued pursuant to the conversion or
exercise of convertible or exercisable securities outstanding on the Filing Date;

(D) Common Stock issued or deemed issued pursuant to
subsection 4(d)(i)(E) as a result of a decrease in the Series Al Conversion Price resulting from
the operation of Section 4(d);

(E) Common Stock issued to persons or entities with which this
corporation has business relationships, provided such issuances are for other than primarily
equity financing purposes and are approved by at least two-thirds of the outstanding Series Al
Preferred Stock; or

GDSVF&H11004150.1 11
(F) | Common Stock issued pursuant to any equipment leasing
arrangement or debt financing from a bank or similar institution, provided such financing is
primarily for non-equity purposes and is approved by at least two-thirds of the outstanding Series
Al Preferred Stock.

(iii) | In the event this corporation should at any time or from time to
time after the Filing Date and the Recapitalization fix a record date for the effectuation of a split
or subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or the determination of holders of
Common Stock entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of
Common Stock or other securities or rights convertible into, or entitling the holder thereof to
receive directly or indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock (hereinafter referred to as
“Common Stock Equivalents”) without payment of any consideration by such holder for the
additional shares of Common Stock or the Common Stock Equivalents (including the additional
shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof), then, as of such record
date (or the date of such dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no record date is fixed), the
Series Al Conversion Price for the Series A1 Preferred Stock shall be appropriately decreased so
that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion shall be increased in
proportion to such increase of the aggregate of shares of Common Stock outstanding and those
issuable with respect to such Common Stock Equivalents with the number of shares issuable
with respect to Common Stock Equivalents determined from time to time in the manner provided
for deemed issuances in subsection 4(d)i)(E).

(iv) If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any time
after the Filing Date and the Recapitalization is decreased by a combination of the outstanding
shares of Common Stock, then, following the record date of such combination, the Series Al
Conversion Price shall be appropriately increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable on conversion shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares.
For the sake of clarity, no adjustment shall be made to the Conversion Price of the Series Al
Preferred Stock as a result of the Recapitalization.

(e) Other Distributions. In the event this corporation shall declare a
distribution payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by this
corporation or other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred
to in subsection 4(d)(ii), then, in each such case for the purpose of this subsection 4(e), the
holders of Series Al Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any such
distribution as though they were the holders of the number of shares of Common Stock of this
corporation into which their shares of Series Al Preferred Stock are convertible as of the record
date fixed for the determination of the holders of Common Stock of this corporation entitled to
receive such distribution.

(f) Recapitalizations. If at any time or from time to time there shall be a
recapitalization of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision, combination or merger or sale
of assets transaction provided for elsewhere in this Section 4 or in Section 2 or the
Recapitalization) provision shall be made so that the holders of the Series Al Preferred Stock
shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of their shares of Series Al Preferred
Stock the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of this corporation or
otherwise, to which a holder of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion would have been

GDSVF&H\1004 150, 1 12
entitled on such recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the
application of the provisions of this Section 4 with respect to the rights of the holders of the
Series Al Preferred Stock after the recapitalization to the end that the provisions of this Section 4
(including adjustment of the Series Al Conversion Price then in effect and the number of shares
purchasable upon conversion of Series Al Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event as
nearly equivalently as may be practicable.

(g)  NoFractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments.

(i) No fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of any
share or shares of the Series Al Preferred Stock and the aggregate number of shares of Common
Stock to be issued to particular stockholders, ‘shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share
and the corporation shall pay in cash the fair market value of any fractional shares as determined
in good faith by the Board of Directors of this corporation. Whether or not fractional shares
would be issuable upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of
shares of Series Al Preferred Stock the holder is at the time converting into Common Stock and
the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion.

(ii) | Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the
Series Al Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4, this corporation, at its expense, shall
promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and
prepare and furnish to each holder of Series Al Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such
adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or
readjustment is based. This corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder
of Series Al Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate
setting forth (A) such adjustment and readjustment, (B) the Series Al Conversion Price at the
time in effect, and (C) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other
property that at the time would be received upon the conversion of a share of Series Al Preferred
Stock.

(h) Notices of Record Date. In the event of any taking by this corporation ofa
record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof
who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend) or other distribution, this
corporation shall mail to each holder of Series Al Preferred Stock, at least ten (10) days prior to
the date specified therein, a notice specifying the date on which any such record is to be taken for
the purpose of such dividend or distribution, and the amount and character of such dividend or
distribution.

(i) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. This corporation shall at
all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock,
solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Series Al Preferred Stock,
such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding shares of the Series Al Preferred Stock; and if at any time the
number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Series Al Preferred Stock, in addition to such
other remedies as shall be available to the holder of such Series Al Preferred Stock, this
corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to

GDS VF&H\10041 50.1 13
increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall
be sufficient for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain
the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to this Fourth Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

(j) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Section 4 to be
given to the holders of shares of Series Al Preferred Stock shall be deemed given if deposited in
the United States mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to each holder of record at his address
appearing on the books of this corporation.

(k) Waiver of Adjustment to Series Al Conversion Price. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, any downward adjustment of the Series Al Conversion Price
may be waived, either prospectively or retroactively and either generally or in a particular
instance, by the consent or vote of the holders of two-thirds of the then outstanding shares of
Series Al Preferred Stock. Any such waiver shall bind all future holders of shares of Series A]
Preferred Stock.

4A. Special Mandatory Conversion.

(a) Trigger Event. In the event that any holder of shares of Series Al
Preferred Stock does not participate in a Qualified Financing (as defined below) by purchasing in
the aggregate, in such Qualified Financing and within the time period specified by this
corporation (provided that this corporation has sent to each holder of Series Al Preferred Stock
at least ten (10) days written notice of, and the opportunity to purchase its Pro Rata Amount (as
defined below) of, the Qualified Financing), such holder’s Pro Rata Amount, then each share of
Series Al Preferred Stock held by such holder shall automatically, and without any further action
on the part of such holder, be converted into shares of Common Stock at the Series Al
Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the consummation of such Qualified Financing,
effective upon, subject to, and concurrently with, the consummation of the Qualified Financing.
For purposes of determining the number of shares of Series Al Preferred Stock owned by a
holder, and for determining the number of Offered Securities (as defined below) a holder of
Series Al Preferred Stock has purchased in a Qualified Financing, all shares of Series Al
Preferred Stock held by Affiliates (as defined below) of such holder shall be aggregated with
such holder's shares and all Offered Securities purchased by Affiliates of such holder shall be
aggregated with the Offered Securities purchased by such holder (provided that no shares or
securities shall be attributed to more than one entity or person within any such group of affiliated
entities or persons). Such conversion is referred to as a “Special Mandatory Conversion.”

(b) Procedural Requirements. Upon a Special Mandatory Conversion, each
holder of shares of Series Al Preferred Stock converted pursuant to subsection 4A(a) shall be
sent written notice of such Special Mandatory Conversion and the place designated for
mandatory conversion of all such shares of Series Al Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section
4A. Upon receipt of such notice, each holder of such shares of Series Al Preferred Stock shall
surrender his, her or its certificate or certificates for all such shares (or, if such holder alleges that
such certificate has been fost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement
reasonably acceptable to this corporation to indemnify this corporation against any claim that
may be made against this corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such

GDS VF&H\1004150.1 14
certificate) to this corporation at the place designated in such notice. If so required by this
corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by written
instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to this corporation, duly executed by
the registered holder or by his, her or its attorney duly authorized in writing. All rights with
respect to the Series Al Preferred Stock converted pursuant to subsection 4A(a), including the
rights, if any, to receive notices and vote (other than as a holder of Common Stock), will
terminate at the time of the Special Mandatory Conversion (notwithstanding the failure of the
holder or holders thereof to surrender the certificates for such shares at or prior to such time),
except only the rights of the holders thereof, upon surrender of their certificate or certificates
therefor (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement), to receive the items provided for in the next
sentence of this subsection 4A(b). As soon as practicable after the Special Mandatory
Conversion and the surrender of the certificate or certificates (or lost certificate affidavit and
agreement) for Series Al Preferred Stock so converted, this corporation shall issue and deliver to
such holder, or to his, her or its nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of full
shares of Common Stock issuable on such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof,
together with cash as provided in subsection 4(g) in lieu of any fraction ofa share of Common
Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion and the payment of any declared but unpaid
dividends on the shares of Series Al Preferred Stock converted. Such converted Series Al
Preferred Stock shall be retired and cancelled and may not be reissued as shares of such series,
and this corporation may thereafter take such appropriate action (without the need for
stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Series Al
Preferred Stock accordingly.

(c) Definitions. For purposes of this Section 4A, the following definitions
shall apply:

(i) “Affiliate” shall mean, with respect to any holder of shares of
Series Al Preferred Stock, any person, entity or firm which, directly or indirectly, controls, is
controlled by or is under common contro! with such holder, including, without limitation, any
entity of which the holder is a partner or member, any partner, officer, director, member or
employee of such holder and any venture capital fund now or hereafter existing of which the
holder is a partner or member which is controlled by or under common control with one or more
general partners of such holder or shares the same management company with such holder.

(ii) | “Offered Securities” shall mean the equity securities of this
corporation set aside by the Board of Directors of this corporation for purchase by holders of
outstanding shares of Series Al Preferred Stock in connection with a Qualified Financing, and
offered to such holders.

(iii) “Pro Rata Amount” shall mean, with respect to any holder of
Series Al Preferred Stock, the lesser of (a) a number of Offered Securities calculated by
multiplying the aggregate number of Offered Securities by a fraction, the numerator of which is
equal to the number of shares of Series Al Preferred Stock owned by such holder, and the
denominator of which is equal to the aggregate number of outstanding shares of Series A}
Preferred Stock, or (b) the maximum number of Offered Securities that such holder is permitted
by this corporation to purchase in such Qualified Financing, after giving effect to any cutbacks or

GDSVF&H\1004 150.1 15
limitations established by the Board of Directors and applied on a pro rata basis to all holders of
Series Al Preferred Stock.

(iv) “Qualified Financing” shall mean any transaction involving the
issuance or sale of Additional Stock after the Filing Date, unless the holders of at least two-thirds
of the Series Al Preferred Stock elect, by written notice sent to the Corporation at least two days
prior to the consummation of the Qualified Financing, that such transaction not be treated as a
Qualified Financing for purposes of this Section 4A.

5. Voting Rights.

(a) General Voting Rights. The holder of each share of Series Al Preferred
Stock shall have the right to one vote for each share of Common Stock into which such Series
A] Preferred Stock could then be converted, and with respect to such vote, such holder shall
have full voting rights and powers equal to the voting rights and powers of the holders of
Common Stock, and shall be entitled, notwithstanding any provision hereof, to notice of any
stockholders’ meeting in accordance with the Bylaws of this corporation, and except as provided
in subsection 5(b) below with respect to the election of directors by the separate class vote of the
holders of Common Stock, shall be entitled to vote, together with holders of Common Stock,
with respect to any question upon which holders of Common Stock have the right to vote.
Fractional votes shall not, however, be permitted and any fractional voting rights available on an
as-converted basis (after aggregating all shares into which shares of Series Al Preferred Stock
held by each holder could be converted) shall be rounded to the nearest whole number (with one-
half being rounded upward).

(b) Voting for the Election of Directors. As long as at least 2,000,000 shares
of Series Al Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, combinations,
subdivisions, recapitalizations or the like occurring after the Recapitalization) remain
outstanding, the holders of such shares of Series A] Preferred Stock shall be entitled to elect two
(2) directors of this corporation (the “Preferred Directors”) at any election of directors. The
holders of Series Al Preferred Stock and Common Stock (voting together as a single class and
not as separate series, and on an as-converted basis) shall be entitled to elect any remaining
directors of this corporation.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 223(a)(1) and 223(a)(2) of the General
Corporation Law, any vacancy, including newly created directorships resulting from any
increase in the authorized number of directors or amendment of this Fourth Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation, and vacancies created by removal or resignation of a
director, may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, though less than a quorum, or
by a sole remaining director, and the directors so chosen shall hold office until the next annual
election and until their successors are duly elected and shall qualify, unless sooner displaced;
provided, however, that where such vacancy occurs among the directors elected by the holders of
a class or series of stock, any such vacancy will be filled by the holders of such class or series of
stock by (i) voting for their own designee to fill such vacancy at a meeting of the Company’s
stockholders or (ii) written consent, if the consenting stockholders hold a sufficient number of
shares to elect their designee at a meeting of the stockholders. Any director may be removed
during his or her term of office, either with or without cause, by, and only by, the affirmative

GDSVF&H\1004150.1 16
vote of the holders of a two-thirds of the shares of the class or series of stock entitled to elect
such director or directors, given either at a special meeting of such stockholders duly called for
that purpose or pursuant to a written consent of stockholders, and any vacancy thereby created
may be filled by a vote of the holders of two-thirds of that class or series of stock represented at
the meeting or pursuant to written consent.

6. Protective Provisions. So long as any shares of Series AJ Preferred Stock
remain outstanding, this corporation shall not (by amendment, merger, consolidation or
otherwise) without first obtaining the approval (by vote or written consent, as provided by law)
of the holders of at least two-thirds of the then outstanding shares of Series A] Preferred Stock:

(a) amend, alter, or waive any provision of this corporation’s Fourth

commit to enter into or make any investment in any joint ventures or partnerships;

(i) sell, transfer or dispose of, in any transaction or series of related

contrary contained in Section 6(b), in the event any shares of Series Al Preferred Stock shall be

GDSVF&H\1004 150.1 18
redeemed or converted pursuant to Section 3 or Section 4 hereof, the shares so redeemed or
