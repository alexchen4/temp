such removal; provided, however, that, unless the entire Board of Directors is removed, no
individual director may be removed when the votes cast against such director’s removal, or not
consenting in writing to such removal, would be sufficient to elect that director if voted
cumulatively at an election which the same total number of votes were cast (or, if such action is

(i) Bach holder of Series Preferred who desires to convert the

certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Company or any transfer agent tor the
Series Preferred, and shall give written notice to the Company at such office that such holder
elects to convert the same. Such notice shall state the number of shares of Series Preferred being
converted. Thereupon, the Company shall promptly issue and deliver at such office to such
holder a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled and shall promptly pay (i) in cash or, to the extent sufficient funds are not then
legally available therefor, in Common Stock (at the Common Stock’s fair market value
determined by the Board of Directors as of the date of such conversion), any declared and unpaid
dividends on the shares of Series Preferred being converted and (ji) in cash (at the Common
Stock’s fair market value determined by the Board of Directors in good faith as of the date of
conversion) the value of any fractional share of Common Stock otherwise issuable to any holder
of Series Preferred. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made at the close of business
on the date of such surrender of the certificates representing the shares of Series Preferred to be
converted, and the person entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such

12,
707178 v14/SD
MAY,

9.2011 5:19PM CSC NO. 0321  P. 14

conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such shares of Common Stock
on such date.

(ii) If the conversion is in connection with an underwritten
offering of securities pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Ac?”), the
conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering shares of Series Preferred for conversion,
be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to such
offering, in which event the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock upon conversion of
the Series Preferred shall not be deemed to have converted such Series Preferred until
immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities.

(e) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If at any time
or from time to time after the Filing Date the Company effects a subdivision of the outstanding
Common Stock without a corresponding subdivision of the Preferred Stock, the applicable Series
Preferred Conversion Price in effect immediately before that subdivision shall be proportionately
decreased. Conversely, if at any time or from time to time after the Filing Date the Co:npany
combines the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares without a
corresponding combination of the Preferred Stock, the applicable Series Preferred Conversion
Price in effect immediately before the combination shall be proportionately increased. Any
adjustment under this Section 4(e) shall become effective at the close of business on the date the
subdivision or combination becomes effective.

(f) Adjustment for Common Stock Dividends and Distributions.
If at any time or from time to time after the Filing Date the Company pays a dividend or other
distribution in additional shares of Common Stock, the applicable Series Preferred Conversion
Price that is then in effect shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance, as provided below:

(i) The applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be
adjusted by multiplying the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price then in effect by a
fraction:

(A) the numerator of which is the total number of shares
of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance, and

(B) ‘the denominator of which is the total number of
shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance
plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or
distribution;

(ii) If the Company fixes a record date to determine which
holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution, the
applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be fixed as of the close of business on such
record date and the number of shares of Common Stock shall be calculated immediately prior to
the close of business on such record date; and

(iii) If such record date is fixed and such dividend is not fully
paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the applicable Series
Preferred Conversion Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such

13.
707178 vid/SD
MAY.

9.2011 5:19PM CSC NO. 0321 =P. 15

record date and thereafter the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be adjusted
pursuant to this Section 4(f) to reflect the actual payment of such dividend or distribution.

(g) Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. If
at any time or from time to time after the Filing Date, the Common Stock issuable upon the
conversion of the Series Preferred is changed into the same or a different number of shares of
any class or classes of stock, whether by recapitalization, reclassification or otherwise (other than
an Acquisition or Asset Transfer as defined in Section 3 or a subdivision or combination of
shares or stock dividend or a reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale of assets provided for
elsewhere in this Section 4), in any such event cach holder of Series Preferred shall then have the
right to convert such stock into the kind and amount of stock and other securities and property
receivable upon such recapitalization, reclassification or other change equivalent to the
maximum number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series Preferred could
have been converted immediately prior to such recapitalization, reclassification or change, all
subject to further adjustment as provided herein or with respect to such other securities or
property by the terms thereof.

(h) Reorganizations, Mergers or Consolidations. If at any time or
from time to time after the Filing Date, there is a capital reorganization of the Common Stock or
the merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another corporation or another entity or
person (other than an Acquisition or Asset Transfer as defined in Section 3 or a recapitalization,
subdivision, combination, reclassification, exchange or substitution of shares provided for
elsewhere in this Section 4), as a part of such capital reorganization, provision shall be made so
that the holders of Series Preferred shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of the
Series Preferred the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the Company to
which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion would
have been entitled on such capital reorganization, merger or consolidation subject to adjustment
in respect of such stock or securities by the terms thereof. In any such case, appropriate
adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 4 with respect to the
rights of the holders of Series Preferred after the capital reorganization, merger or consolidation
to the end that the provisions of this Section 4 (including adjustment of the applicable Series
Preferred Conversion Price then in effect and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of
the Series Preferred) shall be applicable after that event and be as nearly equivalent as
practicable.

(i) Sale of Shares Below Series D Preferred Conversion Price,
Series D-2 Preferred Conversion Price or Series D-3 Preferred Conversion Price.

(i) If at any time or from time to time after the Filing Date, the
Company issues or sells, or is deemed by the express provisions of this Section 4(i) to have
issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock (as defined in Section 4(i)(iv) below), other
than as a dividend or other distribution on any class of stock as provided in Section 4(f) above,

determined by multiplying the Series D Preferred Conversion Price, Series D-2 Preferred
Conversion Price or Series D-3 Preferred Conversion Price, as applicable, in effect immeciiately
prior to such issuance or sale by a fraction (1) the numerator of which shall be (A) the number of
shares of Common Stock deemed outstanding (as defined below) immediately prior to such issue
or sale, plus (B) the number of shares of Common Stock which the Aggregate Consideration
received (as defined in Section 4(i)(@i) below) by the Company for the total number of Additional
Shares of Common Stock so issued would purchase at such Series D Preferred Conversion Price,
Series D-2 Preferred Conversion Price or Series D-3 Preferred Conversion Price, as applicable,
and (2) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock deemed
outstanding (as defined below) immediately prior to such issue or sale plus the total number of
Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, the
number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be outstanding as of a given date shall be the sum
of (A) the number of shares of Common Stock actually outstanding on the day immectiately
preceding the given date, (B) the number of shares of Common Stock into which the then
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock could be converted if fully converted on the day
immediately preceding the given date and (C) the number of shares of Common Stock which
could be obtained through the exercise or conversion of all other rights, options, warrants and

to the preceding sentence shall be included in any subsequent adjustment to the Series D
Preferred Conversion Price, Series D-2 Preferred Conversion Price or Series D-3 Preferred
Conversion Price, as applicable.

(ii) For the purpose of making any adjustment required under
this Section 4(i), the aggregate consideration received by the Company for any issue or sale of
securities (the “Aggregate Consideration”) shall be defined as: (A) to the extent it consists of
cash, be computed at the net amount of cash received by the Company after deduction of any
underwriting or similar commissions, compensation or concessions paid or allowed by the
Company in connection with such issue or sale but without deduction of any expenses payable
by the Company, (B) to the extent it consists of property other than cash, be computed at the fair
value of that property as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, and (C) if
Additional Shares of Common Stock, Convertible Securities (as defined in Section 4(i)(ii)
below) or rights or options to purchase either Additional Shares of Common Stock or
Convertible Securities are issued or sold together with other stock or securities or other assets of
the Company for a consideration which covers both, be computed as the portion of the
consideration so received that may be reasonably determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors to be allocable to such Additional Shares of Common Stock, Convertible Securities or
rights or options.

(iii) For the purpose of the adjustment required under this
Section 4(i), if the Company issues or sells (x) stock or other securities convertible into
Additional Shares of Common Stock (such convertible stock or securities being herein referred

15.
707178 vIA/SD
MAY. 9. 2011 5:20PM CSC NO.0321 P17

Common Stock is less than the Series D Preferred Conversion Price, Series D-2 Preferred
Conversion Price or Series D-3 Preferred Conversion Price, as applicable, in cach case the
Company shall be deemed to have issued at the time of the issuance of such rights or options or
Convertible Securities the maximum number of Additional Shares of Common Stock issuable
upon exercise or conversion thereof and to have received as consideration for the issuance of
such shares an amount equal to the total amount of the consideration, if any, received by the
Company for the issuance of such rights or options or Convertible Securities plus, (1) in the case
of such rights or options, the minimum amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Cornpany
upon the exercise of such rights or options, plus, (2) in the case of Convertible Securities, the
minimum amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon the conversion thereof
(other than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities);
provided that if the minimum amounts of such consideration cannot be ascertained, but are a
function of antidilution or similar protective clauses, the Company shall be deemed to have
received the minimum amounts of consideration without reference to such clauses; provided
further (3) that if the minimum amount of consideration payable to the Company upon the
exercise or conversion of rights, options or Convertible Securities is reduced over time or on the
occurrence or non-occurrence of specified events other than by reason of antidilution
adjustments, the Effective Price shall be recalculated using the figure to which such minimum
amount of consideration is reduced; provided further, that if the minimum amount of
consideration payable to the Company upon the exercise or conversion of such rights, options or
Convertible Securities is subsequently increased, the Effective Price shall be again recalculated
using the increased minimum amount of consideration payable to the Company upon the
exercise or conversion of such rights, options or Convertible Securities (provided, however, no
such adjustment of the Series D Preferred Conversion Price, Series D-2 Preferred Conversion
Price or Series D-3 Preferred Conversion Price, as applicable, shall affect the Common Stock
previously issued upon conversion of such series of Preferred Stock). No further adjustment of
the Series D Preferred Conversion Price, Series D-2 Preferred Conversion Price or Series D-3
Preferred Conversion Price, as applicable, as adjusted upon the issuance of such rights, options
or Convertible Securities, shall be made as a result of the actual issuance of Additional Shares of
Common Stock or the exercise of any such rights or options or the conversion of any such
Convertible Securities. If any such rights or options or the conversion privilege represented by
any such Convertible Securities shall expire without having been exercised, the Series D
Preferred Conversion Price, Series D-2 Preferred Conversion Price or Series D-3 Preferred
Conversion Price, as applicable, as adjusted upon the issuance of such rights, optivwns or
Convertible Securities shall be readjusted to the Series D Preferred Conversion Price, Series D-2
Preferred Conversion Price or Series D-3 Preferred Conversion Price, as applicable, which would
have been in effect had an adjustment been made on the basis that the only Additional Shares of
Common Stock so issued were the Additional Shares of Common Stock, if any, actually issued
or sold on the exercise of such rights or options or rights of conversion of such Convertible
Securities, and such Additional Shares of Common Stock, if any, were issued or sold for the
consideration actually received by the Company upon such exercise, plus the consideration, if
any, actually received by the Company for the granting of all such rights or options, whether or
not exercised, plus the consideration received for issuing or selling the Convertible Securities
actually converted, plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the Company (other than
by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities) on the
conversion of such Convertible Securities, provided that such readjustment shall not apply to

authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all then outstanding shares of the Series Preferred, the Company will take such corporate
action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.

and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in which the shares of Series
Preferred so converted were registered,
