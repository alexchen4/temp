fair market value thereof, as determined by the Board of Directors in good faith.

that number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as it is then convertible in
accordance with the terms hereof. The number of shares of Common Stock into which cach
share of Series A Preferred Stock may be converted shall be determined by dividing the Series A
Preference Amount by the appropriate conversion price for the Series A Preferred Stock then in
effect at the time of conversion (such conversion price referred to herein as the “Series A
Conversion Price’). The initial Series A Conversion Price shall be $1.00 per share and shall be
subject to adjustment as provided herein. The number of shares of Common Stock into which
each share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock may be converted shall be determined by dividing the

Stock then in effect at the time of conversion (such conversion price referred to herein as the
“Series A-1 Conversion Price’’). The initial Series A-1 Conversion Price shall be $0.44 per
share and shall be subject to adjustment as provided herein. The number of shares of Common
Stock into which each share of Series A-2 Preferred Stock may be converted shall be determined

agreement of the holdcrs of at least 75% of the then outstanding shares of Series Preferred Stock,

holder would otherwise be entitled, the Company shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied
by the then fair market value of such fractional shares as determined by the Board of Directors of
the Company. Before any holder of Series Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same
into full shares of Common Stock, and to receive certificates therefor, he shall surrender the
certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Company or of any transfer
agent for the Series Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the Company at such office
that he elects to convert the same; provided, however, that in the event of an automatic
conversion pursuant to Section 4(b), the outstanding shares of Series Preferred Stock shall be
converted automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or
not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Company or its transfer agent;
provided, further, that the Company shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such automatic conversion unless either the certificates

certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement and provides, if
requested by the Company, a bond satisfactory to the Company to indemnify the Company from
any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates.

The Company shall, as soon as practicable after such delivery, or after such agreement
and indemnification, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Series Preferred Stock, a
certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall
be entitled as aforesaid and a check payable to the holder in the amount of any cash amounts
payable as the result of a conversion into fractional shares of Common Stock, plus any declared

8
LA_DOCS\770749.7[ W2000]

to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the
shares of Series Preferrcd Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shal] be treated for all purposes as the
record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date; provided, however, that
it the conversion is in connection with the consummation of the first firmly underwritten public
offering of the Company’s Common Stock registered under the Securities Act (an “IPO’’) or any

of any holder tendering Series Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing of
the sale of securities pursuant to such [PO or Liquidation Event, in which event the person(s)
entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of the Series Preferred
Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Series Preferred Stock until immediately prior
to the closing or consummation of the IPO or Liquidation Event, subject to each Series Preferred
Conversion Price adjustment, if any, pursuant to Section 4(d)(iii) below.

been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, provided that Additional Shares of
Common Stock shall not be deemed to have been issued with respect to an adjustment of any

Series A-1 Conversion Price in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such issue, or such
record date, as the case may be, and provided further that in any such case in which Additional
Shares of Common Stock are deemed to be issued:

Options or Convertible Securities are not issued on the date fixed therefor, the adjustment
previously made in any Series Preferred Conversion Price which became effective on such
record date shall be canceled as of the close of business on such record date, and thereafter such
Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this Section A(d)(ii) as of the

minimum agpregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating
thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such

conversion, retained such securities receivable by them as aforesaid during such period, subject

with the effectiveness of such reorganization or reclassification, be proportionately adjusted such
that the Series Preferred Stock shall be convertible into, in lieu of the number of shares of
Common Stock which the holders would otherwise have been entitled to receive, a number of
shares of such other class or classes of stock equivalent to the number of shares of Common
Stock that would have been subject to receipt by the holders upon conversion of the Series
Preferred Stock immediately before that change.

Stock deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled upon such capital reorganization,

merger, consolidation, or sale. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the
