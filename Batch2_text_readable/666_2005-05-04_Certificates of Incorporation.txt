shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon
such conversion unless the certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are either
delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent as provided below, or the holder notifies the
Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and

GDSVF&HO10285.5 -12-
(1) The aggregate maximum number of shares
of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion, exchange or exercise (assuming the satisfaction
of any conditions to convertibility, exchangeability or exercisability, including, without
limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account potential antidilution
adjustments) of any Common Stock Equivalents and subsequent conversion, exchange or
exercise thereof shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or
such Common Stock Equivalents were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration,
if any, received by the Corporation for any such securities and related Common Stock
Equivalents (excluding any cash received on account of accrued interest or accrued dividends),
plus the minimum additional consideration, if any, to be received by the Corporation (without
taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) upon the conversion, exchange or exercise
of any Common Stock Equivalents (the consideration in each case to be determined in the
manner provided in Section 4(d)(i)(D).

(2) In the event of any change in the number of
shares of Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon
conversion, exchange or exercise of any Common Stock Equivalents including, but not limited
to, a change resulting from the antidilution provisions thereof, the Conversion Price of the Series
2 Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, or Series D-1 Preferred Stock to the extent in any
way affected by or computed using such Common Stock Equivalents, shall be recomputed to
reflect such change, but no further adjustment shall be made for the actual issuance of Common
Steck or any payment of such consideration upon the conversion, exchange or exercise of such
Common Stock Equivalents.

(3) Upon the termination or expiration of the
convertibility, exchangeability or exercisability of any Common Stock Equivalents, the
Conve:sion Price of the Series D-1 Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock or Series C
Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such Common Stock
Equivalents, shall be recomputed to reflect the ‘ssuance of only the number of shares of Common
Stock (and Common Stock Equivalents that remain convertible, exchangeable or exercisable)
actually issued upon the conversion, exchange or exercise of such Common Stock Equivalents.

(4) The number of shares of Common Stock
deemed issued and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to Section 4(d)(i(E)(1) shall
be appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or expiration of the type described in
either Section 4(d)(i)(E)(2) or 4(d)(iKE)(3).

(F) No Increased Conversion Price. Notwithstanding
any other provisions of this Section (4)(d)(i), except to the limited extent provided for in Sections
4(d)(i)(E)(2) and 4(d)(iXE)(3), no adjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section
4(d)(i) shall have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price above the Conversion Price in
effect immediately prior to such adjustment.

(ii) Stock Splits and Dividends. In the event that the

Corporation should at eny time after the Purchase Date fix a record date for the effectuation of a
split or subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or the determination of holders

GDSVFaHs 10285.5 -13-
of Common Stock entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares
of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents without payment of any consideration by such
holder for the additional shares of Common Stock or the Common Stock Equivalents (including
the additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof), then, as of
such record date (or the date of such dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no record date
is fixed), the Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock shall be appropriately decreased so that the
number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be
increased in proportion to such increase of the aggregate of shares of Common Stock outstanding
and tnose issuable with respect to such Common Stock Equivalents with the number of shares
issuable with respect to Common Stock Equivalents determined from time to time in the manner
provided for deemed issuances in Section 4(d){i)(E).

(iii) | Reverse Stock Splits. If the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding at any time after the Purchase Date is decreased by a combination of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock, then, following the record date of such combination, the
Conversion Price for the Preferred Stock shall be appropriately increased so that the number of
shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be decreased
in proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares.

(e) Other Distributions. In the event the Corporation shall declare a
distribution payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by the
Corporation or other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred
to in Section 4(d)(ii), then. in each such case for the purpose of this Section 4(e), the holders of
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any such distribution as though they
were the holders of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation into which their
shares of Preferred Stock are convertible as of the record date fixed for the determination of the
holders of Common Stock of the Corporation entitled to receive such distribution.

(f) Recapitalizations. If at any time or from time to time there shall be
a recapitalization of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision, combination or merger or sale
of assets transaction provided for elsewhere in this Section 4 or in Secticn 2) provision shall be
made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon
conversion of such Preferred Stock the number of shares of stock or other securities or property
of the Corporation or otherwise, to which a holder: of Common Stock deliverable upon
conversion would have been entitled on such recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate
adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 4 with respect to the
rights of the holders of such Preferred Stock after the recapitalization to the end that the
provisions of this Section 4 (including adjustment of the Conversion Price then in effect and the
number of shares purchasable upon conversion of such Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after
that event and be as nearly equivalent as practicable.

(g) No Impaimment. The Corporation wil) not, by amendment of its
Articles of Incorporation (except in accordance with Section 5 hereof and applicable law) or
through any reorganization, recapitalization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution,
issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or
performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Corporation, but

Conversion Rights of the holders of Preferred Stock against impairment.

(i) No frac. "ial shares shal] be issued upon the conversion of
any share or shares of the Preferred Stack, anc the number of shares of Common Stock to be
issued shall be rounded up to the next nearest whole share. The number of shares issuable upon
such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock
the holder is at the time converting into Common Stock and the number of shares of Common
Stock issuable upon such aggregate conversion.

(ii) Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of
the Conversion Price of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation, at its
expense, shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms
hereof and prepare ard furnish to each holder of such Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth
such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or
readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder
of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such hoider a like certificate setting forth

class or any other securities or property, or to receive any other right, the Corporation shall mai!
to each holder of Preferred Stock, at least 20 days prior to the date specified therein, a noice
specifying the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend,
distribution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right.

(j) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation
shal] at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common

Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock,
such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding shares of such series of Preferred Stock; and if at any time the
number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all then outstanding shares of such series of Preferred Stock, in addition to such
other remedies as shall be available to the holder of such Preferred Stock, the Corporation will
take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its
authonzed but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient
for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite
shareholder approval of any necessary amendment to these Restated Aniicles.
