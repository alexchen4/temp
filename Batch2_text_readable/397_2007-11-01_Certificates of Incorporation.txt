Fifty Three Million Seven Hundred Two Thousand Four Hundred Seventy One (53,702,471).
Thirty Two Million (32,000,000) shares shall be Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share,
and Twenty One Million Seven Hundred Two Thousand Four Hundred Seventy One
(21,702,471) shares shall be Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share. Upon the

outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be changed, combined and reclassified into one (1)
whole share of Common Stock, which shares shall be fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Common Stock of the Corporation (the “Reverse Split”); provided, however, no fractional shares
shall be issued in the Reverse Split, and the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued to
each holder shall be rounded up to the nearest whole share.

B. Rights, Preferences and Restrictions of Preferred Stock. The Preferred Stock
authorized by this Certificate of Incorporation may be issued from time to time in one or more
series. The rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions granted to and imposed on the Series
A Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred Stock”), which series shall consist of One
Million Eight Hundred Thirty Eight Thousand Thirteen (1,838,013) shares, the Series B-1]
Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series B-! Preferred Stock’’), which series shall consist of Sixteen
Million Two Hundred Fifty Thousand (16,250,000) shares, and the Series B-2 Convertible
Preferred Stock (“Series B-2 Preferred Stock”), which series shall consist of Three Million Six
Hundred Fourteen Thousand Four Hundred Fifty Eight (3,614,458) shares, are as set forth below
in this Article [V(B). All of the outstanding shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock
which were outstanding immediately prior to the Third Amendment Date shall be redesignated
as shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock as of the Third Amendment Date. The rights,
preferences, privileges, and restrictions granted to and imposed on the Series B-1 Preferred Stock
and the Series B-2 Preferred Stock shall be identical in all respects except as otherwise provided
in this Certificate of Incorporation. The Series B-1 Preferred Stock and the Series B-2 Preferred
Stock shall together be referred to herein as the “Series B Preferred Stock.” The Series A
Preferred Stock, the Series B-1 Preferred Stock and the Series B-2 Preferred Stock shall together
be referred to herein as the “Preferred Stock.”

l. Dividend Provisions.

(a) The holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred
Stock shall be entitled to receive dividends (the “Fixed Dividends”), out of any assets legally
available therefor, payable at a per annum rate equal to eight percent (8%) (the “Dividend Rate”)
of the Series A Original Issue Price (as hereafter defined), the Series B-1 Original Issue Price (as
hereafter defined) and the Series B-2 Original Issue Price (as hereafter defined), respectively,
calculated from the date of issuance (the “Accrual Date”). For purposes of this Certificate of
Incorporation, the “Series A Original Issue Price” and the “Series B-2 Original Issue Price” will
each be $0.83 per share, as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations or the
like occurring after the Third Amendment Date with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock or
the Series B-2 Preferred Stock, respectively. The “Series B-1 Original Issue Price” with respect

2
to any shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock issuable upon conversion of a Note (as defined
below) will be equal to the conversion price at which such Note was so converted. The accrued
Fixed Dividends on shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock shall be payable in cash when and if
declared by the Board or Directors if and only if all accrued Fixed Dividends have been paid to
the holders of Series B-1! Preferred Stock. The accrued Fixed Dividends on shares of Series A
Preferred Stock shall be payable in cash when and if declared by the Board or Directors if and
only if all accrued Fixed Dividends have been paid to the holders of Series B-1 Preferred Stock
and Series B-2 Preferred Stock. Payment of accrued Fixed Dividends on shares of Preferred
Stock shall be payable in cash when and if declared by the Board or Directors. Accrued Fixed
Dividends on any shares of Preferred Stock shal! be cancelled upon conversion of such shares.
Any dividends payable by the Corporation in excess of the Fixed Dividends (“Additional
Dividends”) shall (i) first be paid to the holders of Series B-1 Preferred Stock until such holders
have received aggregate Additional Dividends per share of Series B-1 Preferred Stock that are
equal to the Series B-1 Original Issue Price, (ii) then be paid to the holders of Series B-2
Preferred Stock until such holders have received aggregate Additional Dividends per share of
Series B-2 Preferred Stock that are equal to the Series B-2 Original Issue Price, (ili) then to the
holders of Series A Preferred Stock until such holders have received aggregate Additional
Dividends per share of Series A Preferred Stock that are equal to the Series A Original Issue
Price, and (iv) thereafter to the holders of Common Stock, Series A Preferred Stock, Series B-1
Preferred Stock and Series B-2 Preferred Stock, allocated among such holders on a pro rata
basis, based upon the number of shares of Common Stock held by each assuming the full
conversion of all shares of Preferred Stock. The dividends will be cumulative from the
applicable Accrual Date, and will accrue on a day to day basis from the applicable Accrual Date
based, whether or not earned or declared.

(b) | The Board will fix a record date for the determination of the holders of
Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend
declared thereon, which record date will not be more than forty-five (45) days prior to the date
fixed for payment of such dividends. Accrued Fixed Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock
or Series B Preferred Stock which are not declared and paid will compound quarterly on each
Dividend Compounding Date for each such Series at the Dividend Rate. For purposes of this
Certificate of Incorporation, the “Dividend Compounding Date” for cach share of Preferred

Stock means the first day of each January, April, July and October following the date of issuance
of such share.

(c) Unless all accrued Fixed Dividends (whether or not declared) on each
share of Preferred Stock are paid, and the holders of each such share of Preferred Stock have
received aggregate Additional Dividends per share of Preferred Stock which are equal to the
Original Issue Price for each such share: (i) no dividends or other distributions (other than a
dividend or distribution payable solely in Common Stock) may be declared, made or paid on any
shares of Common Stock; (ii) no shares of Common Stock may be repurchased, exchanged,
redeemed or otherwise acquired for any consideration by the Corporation, any subsidiary of the
Corporation or any entity which the Corporation owns or controls (whether directly or
indirectly), provided, however, that this restriction shall not apply to the Permitted Repurchases

(as defined below); and (iii) no funds may be set apart or reserved with respect to any of the
actions described in clauses (i) or (ii).
(4) In the event the Corporation shall declare a distribution payable in
securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by the Corporation or other persons,
assets (excluding cash dividends pursuant to this Section 1) or options or rights not referred to in
subsection 4(c)(i), then, in each such case the property so distributed shall be valued for purposes
of this Section | at its then fair market value per share as determined by both the Corporation and
the vote or written consent of the holders of more than fifty percent (50%) of the then
outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, voting as a single class (the “Required Majority”), or,
if the Corporation and the Required Majority cannot agree on the fair market value per share, the
fair market value per share as determined by a qualified independent appraiser selected by the
Corporation and by the vote or written consent of the Required Majority; or if the Corporation
and the Required Majority cannot agree on an appraiser, the average of the fair market value per
share as determined by a qualified independent appraiser selected by the Corporation and the fair
market value per share as determined by a qualified independent appraiser selected by the vote or
written consent of the Required Majority.

(e) In the event the amount of Fixed Dividends to be paid on the Series A
Preferred Stock, the Series B-1 Preferred Stock or the Series B-2 Preferred Stock at any time is
not sufficient to pay the accrued but unpaid Fixed Dividends in full on such Series, any partial
payment of such Fixed Dividends will be made to the holders of such Series ratably (on an as-if
converted basis) in proportion to the aggregate accrued but unpaid portion of the Fixed
Dividends on the shares of the applicable Series of Preferred Stock held by such holders.

2. Liquidation Preference.

(a) In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of Series B-1 Preferred Stock will be
entitled to receive in preference to the holders of all other equity securities of the Corporation an
amount per share equal to the greater of (A) the Series B-1 Original Issue Price plus all accrued
but unpaid Fixed Dividends thereon, and (B) the aggregate amount that would be distributable
with respect to the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of
such share of Series B-1 Preferred Stock (assuming for purposes of such calculation, the
conversion of all other shares of Preferred Stock). If upon the occurrence of such event, the
assets and funds thus distributed among the holders of Series B-1 Preferred Stock shall be
insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full aforesaid preferential amounts, then
the entire assets and funds of the Corporation legally available for distribution shall be
distributed ratably among the holders of Series B-1 Preferred Stock in proportion to the
preferential amount each such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive. Thereafter, the
holders of Series B-2 Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive in preference to the holders of
Series A Preferred Stock and Common Stock an amount per share equal to the greater of (A) the
Series B-2 Original Issue Price plus all accrued but unpaid Fixed Dividends thereon, and (B) the
aggregate amount that would be distributable with respect to the aggregate number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such share of Series B-2 Preferred Stock (assuming
for purposes of such calculation, the conversion of all other shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock
and Series A Preferred Stock). If upon the occurrence of such event, the assets and funds thus
distributed among the holders of Series B-2 Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit the
payment to such holders of the full aforesaid preferential amounts, then the entire assets and
funds of the Corporation legally available for distribution shall be distributed ratably among the

4
holders of Series B-2 Preferred Stock in proportion to the preferential amount each such holder
would otherwise be entitled to receive. Thereafter, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock will
be entitled to receive in preference to the holders of Common Stock an amount per share equal to
the greater of (X) the Series A Original Issue Price plus all accrued but unpaid Fixed Dividends
thereon, and (Y) the aggregate amount that would be distributable with respect to the aggregate
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such share of Series A
Preferred Stock (assuming for purposes of such calculation, the conversion of all other shares of
Series A Preferred Stock). If upon the occurrence of such event, the assets and funds thus
distributed among the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit the
payment to such holders of the full aforesaid preferential amounts, then the entire assets and
funds of the Corporation legally available for distribution shall be distributed ratably among the
holders of Series A Preferred Stock in proportion to the preferential amount each such holder
would otherwise be entitled to receive.

(b) | Upon the completion of the distribution required by subparagraph (a) of
this Section 2, the remaining assets and funds of the Corporation legally available for distribution
to stockholders of the Corporation shall be distributed as set forth in Article IV.C.2.

{c) (i) For purposes of this Article IV, unless otherwise agreed by the
vote or written consent of the Required Majority, a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation shall mean any of the following transactions: (A) the acquisition of the Corporation
by another entity by means of any transaction or series of related transactions (including, without
limitation, any reorganization, merger or consolidation) that results in the transfer of fifty percent
(50%) or more of the outstanding voting power of the Corporation; or (B) a sale of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Corporation.

(ii) If the consideration received by the Corporation upon a liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation is other than cash, its value will be deemed its fair
market value. Any securities shall be valued as follows:

(A) Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar
restrictions on free marketability covered by (B) below:

(1) If traded on a securities exchange, the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange over the thirty
(30) day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing of such event;

(2) _ If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall
be deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the
thirty (30) day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing of such event; and

(3) _ If there is no active public market, the value shall be
the fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Corporation and the vote or written
consent of the Required Majority; or, if the Corporation and the Required Majority cannot agree
on the fair market value, the fair market value as determined by a qualified independent appraiser
selected by the Corporation and the vote or written consent of the Required Majority; or if the
Corporation and the Required Majority cannot agree on an appraiser, the average of the fair
market value as determined by a qualified independent appraiser selected by the Corporation and
the fair market value as determined by a qualified independent appraiser selected by the vote or
written consent of the Required Majority.

(B) The method of valuation of securities subject to investment
letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of
a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount
from the fair market value determined as above in (A) (1), (2) or (3) to reflect the approximate
fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Corporation and the vote or written
consent of the Required Majority; or, if the Corporation and the Required Majority cannot agree
on the discount, the discount as determined by a qualified independent appraiser selected by the
Corporation and the vote or written consent of the Required Majority; or if the Corporation and
the Required Majority cannot agree on an appraiser, the average of the discount as determined by
a qualified independent appraiser selected by the Corporation and the discount as determined by
a qualified independent appraiser selected by the vote or written consent of the Required
Majority.

3, Redemption.

(a) At any time and from time to time after December 31, 2011, any holders
of shares of Preferred Stock may, with the vote or written consent of the Required Majority and
subject to satisfaction of the requirements of subsection 10(c), require that the Corporation
purchase the shares of Preferred Stock held by such holders, on a date selected by the Required
Majority (a “Redemption Date”) that is at least six (6) months after written notice is given to the
Corporation, and the Corporation shall purchase such shares, for a price per share equal to the
greater of: (A) the sum of (i) the Series A Original Issue Price, the Series B-1 Preferred Stock or
the Series B-2 Original Issue Price, as applicable, plus (ii) all accrued but unpaid dividends with
respect to such share, (B) an amount which, after taking into account the receipt of all prior
Fixed Dividends and Additional Dividends, provides a holder of such share with an amount
equal to 150% of the Series A Original Issue Price, the Series B-1 Original Issue Price or the
Series B-2 Original Issue Price, as applicable, or (C) the fair market value of such share as of the
date of such notice as mutually determined by the Corporation and the vote or written consent of
the Required Majority, or, if the Corporation and the Required Majority cannot agree on the fair
market value, the fair market value as determined by a qualified independent appraiser selected
by the Corporation and by the vote or written consent of the Required Majority; or, if the
Corporation and the Required Majority cannot agree on an appraiser, the average of the fair
market value as determined by a qualified independent appraiser selected by the Corporation and
the fair market value as determined by a qualified independent appraiser selected by the vote or
written consent of the Required Majority.

(b) At least fifteen (15) but no more than thirty (30) days prior to each
Redemption Date, written notice (the “Redemption Notice”) shall be mailed, first class postage
prepaid, to each holder of record (at the close of business on the business day next preceding the
day on which notice is given) of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock to be
redeemed, at the address last shown on the records of the Corporation for such holder, notifying
such holder of the redemption to be effected on the applicable Redemption Date, specifying the
number of shares to be redeemed from such holder, the Redemption Date, the applicable

6
Redemption Price, the place at which payment may be obtained and calling upon such holder to
surrender to the Corporation, in the manner and at the place designated, the holder’s certificate or
certificates representing the shares to be redeemed (the “Redemption Shares”). Except as
provided in subsection (3){c), on or after each Redemption Date, each holder of the Redemption
Shares to be redeemed on such Redemption Date shall surrender to the Corporation the
certificate or certificates representing such shares, in the manner and at the place designated in
the Redemption Notice, and thereupon the applicable Redemption Price of such shares shall be
payable to the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the
owner thereof and each surrendered certificate shall be canceled. In the event less than all the
shares represented by any such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued
representing the unredeemed shares.

(c) From and after the applicable Redemption Date, unless there shall have
been a default in payment of any applicable Redemption Price, all rights of the holders of
Redemption Shares designated for redemption on such Redemption Date in the Redemption
Notice as holders of such Series A Preferred Stock, Series B-1 Preferred Stock or Series B-2
Preferred Stock (except the right to receive the applicable Redemption Price without interest
upon surrender of their certificate or certificates) shall cease with respect to such shares, and
such shares shall not thereafter be transferred on the books of the Corporation or be deemed to be
outstanding for any purpose whatsoever. If the funds of the Corporation legally available for the
redemption of the Redemption Shares on a Redemption Date are insufficient to redeem the total
number of shares to be redeemed on such date, those funds that are legally available will be used
to redeem the maximum possible number of such shares, first among the holders of such shares
of Series B-1 Preferred Stock to be redeemed (ratably, if necessary), then among the holders of
such shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock to be redeemed (ratably, if necessary) and then among
the holders of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed (ratably, if necessary),
such that each holder of a share of Series B-1 Preferred Stock to be redeemed receives for such
share the same percentage of the applicable Redemption Price as each other holder receives for
any such share, such that each holder of a share of Series B-2 Preferred Stock to be redeemed
receives for such share the same percentage of the applicable Redemption Price as each other
holder receives for any such share and such that each holder of a share of Series A Preferred
Stock to be redeemed receives for such share the same percentage of the applicable Redemption
Price as each other holder receives for any such share. The Redemption Shares not redeemed
shall remain outstanding and entitled to all the rights and preferences provided herein and the
Fixed Dividends as provided for in Section 1 shall continue to accrue with respect to such shares.
At any time thereafter when additional funds of the Corporation are legally available for the
redemption of Redemption Shares, such funds will immediately be used to redeem first the
balance of the shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock, then the balance of the shares of Series B-2
Preferred Stock and then the balance of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, that the Corporation
has become obliged to redeem on the Redemption Date but that it has not redeemed.

4. Conversion. The holders of Preferred Stock shall have conversion obligations and
rights as follows:

(a) Conversion Ratio. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B-1
Preferred Stock and Series B-2 Preferred Stock may at any time be converted as set forth below
into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by

7
dividing the Series A Original Issue Price, the Series B-1 Original Issue Price or the Series B-2
Original Issue Price, as applicable, by the Conversion Price applicable to such Series, determined
as hereafter provided, in effect on the date the certificate is surrendered for conversion. The
Conversion Price per share, upon the effectiveness of the Third Amendment Date, for the Series
A Preferred Stock, the Series B-1 Preferred Stock and the Series B-2 Preferred Stock shall be the
Series A Original Issue Price, the Series B-1 Original Issue Price and the Series B-2 Original
Issue Price, respectively; provided, however, that the Conversion Price for Series A Preferred
Stock, Series B-1 Preferred Stock and Series B-2 Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment
as set forth in subsection 4{c). Such conversion shall automatically occur immediately upon the
Corporation’s sale of its Common Stock in an underwritten public offering pursuant to a
registration statement on Form S-1 or Form SB-2 or any comparable successor form then in
effect under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the public offering price of which is not less
than $4.15 per share (adjusted to reflect subsequent stock dividends, stock splits or
recapitalizations occurring after the Third Amendment Date) and the net proceeds to the
Corporation of which are not less than $20,000,000 in the aggregate (net of underwriters’
discounts and expenses) (a “Qualifying IPO”)

(b) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to voluntarily convert the same into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall
surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or
of any transfer agent for the applicable Series, and shall give written notice to the Corporation at
its principal corporate office, of the election to convert the same and shall state therein the name
or names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued.
Any automatic conversion of Preferred Stock will be conditioned upon the closing with the
underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering, in which event the conversion
shall be deemed to have been made and the persons entitled to receive the Common Stock upon
conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock
immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities. Upon delivery of duly endorsed
certificates for shares of Preferred Stock to be voluntarily converted, or deemed to be
automatically converted, the Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and
deliver at such office to such holder of shares of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or nominees
of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which
such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid.

(c) Conversion Price Adjustments_of Preferred Stock for Splits and
Combinations. The applicable Conversion Price of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B-!
Preferred Stock and Series B-2 Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time
as follows:

(i) (A) _ If the Corporation shall issue, at any time after the Third
Amendment Date, any Additional Stock without consideration or for a consideration per share
less than the Conversion Price for any of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B-1 Preferred
Stock or Series B-2 Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such issuance, the Conversion
Price shall forthwith (except as otherwise provided in this clause (i)) be adjusted to a price
determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be
the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance
(including shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to subsection 4(c)(i)(D)(1) or

8
(2)) plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received by the
Corporation for such issuance would purchase at such Conversion Price; and the denominator of
which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such
issuance (including shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to subsection
4(cXi)(D)(1) or (2)) plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock. Except to the limited
extent provided for in subsections 4(c)(i)(D)(3) and (D)(4), no adjustment of such Conversion
Price pursuant to this subsection 4(c)(i) shall have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price
above the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment.

(B) In the case of the issuance of Common Stock for cash, the
consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefore before deducting any
reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the
Corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

(C) In the case of the issuance of the Common Stock for
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shal! be
deemed to be the fair value thereof as determined by the Board of Directors irrespective of any
accounting treatment.

(D) In the case of the issuance of options to purchase or rights
to subscribe for Common Stock, securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for
Common Stock or options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or
exchangeable securities, the following provisions shall apply for all purposes of this subsection

4(c)(i):

(1) The aggregate maximum number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable upon exercise (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to
exercisability, including without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account
potential antidilution adjustments) of such options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common
Stock shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such options or rights were issued and for
consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in subsections
4(c){i)(B) and 4(cin(C)), if any, received by the Corporation upon the issuance of such options
or rights plus the minimum exercise price provided in such options or rights (without taking into
account potential antidilution adjustments) for the Common Stock covered thereby.

(2) The aggregate maximum number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of, or in exchange for (assuming the satisfaction of
any conditions to convertibility or exchangeability, including, without limitation, the passage of
time, but without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments), any such convertible or
exchangeable securities or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for
such convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof shall
be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or such options or rights
were issued and for consideration equal to the consideration, if any, received by the Corporation
for any such securities and related options or rights (excluding any cash received on account of
accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the minimum additional consideration, if any, to be
received by the Corporation (without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) upon
the conversion or exchange of such securities or the exercise of any related options or rights (the

9
consideration in each case to be determined in the manner provided in subsections 4(c){i)(B) and

A(c)(i)(C)).

(3) In the event of any change in the number of shares
of Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon exercise
of such options or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such convertible or
exchangeable securities, including, but not limited to, a change resulting from the antidilution
provisions thereof (unless such options or rights or convertible or exchangeable securities were
merely deemed to be included in the numerator and denominator for purposes of determining the
number of shares of Common outstanding for purposes of Section 4(c)(iXA)), the Conversion
Price of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B-1 Preferred Stock and Series B-2 Preferred Stock,
to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, rights or securities, shall be
recomputed to reflect such change, but no further adjustment shall be made for the actual
issuance of Common Stock or any payment of such consideration upon the exercise of any such
options or rights or the conversion or exchange of such securities.

(4) | Upon the expiration of any such options or rights,
the termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options or
rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities (unless such options or rights or
convertible or exchangeable securities were merely deemed to be included in the numerator and
denominator for purposes of determining the number of shares of Common outstanding for
purposes of Section 4(c)(i(A)), the Conversion Price of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B-1
Preferred Stock and Series B-2 Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected by such
options, rights or securities or options or rights related to such securities, shall be readjusted as if

such options, rights or securities or options or rights related to such securities had not been
issued.

(E) In the event that Additional Stock is issued in one or more
related transactions, the adjustment to the Conversion Price of the Series A Preferred Stock,
Series B-1 Preferred Stock and Series B-2 Preferred Stock shall be made as of the final closing
of such transaction.

(ii) | “Additional Stock” shall mean any shares of Common Stock
issued (or deemed to have been issued pursuant to subsection 4(ci)(D)) by the Corporation after
the Third Amendment Date other than:

(A) Shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to a transaction
described in subsection 4(c\iii) hereof;

(B) Shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of the
Series A Preferred Stock or the Series B-2 Preferred Stock;

(C) Shares of Common Stock issuable or issued to employees,
consultants, directors or vendors (if in transactions with primarily compensatory, non-financing
purposes) of the Corporation pursuant to any stock option plans or restricted stock plan approved
by the Board of Directors or assumed pursuant to an acquisition;

10
(D) Shares of Common Stock or options or warrants
exercisable for Common Stock issued with the approval of the Board of Directors to banks,
savings and loan associations, equipment lessors or other similar lending institutions in
connection with such entities providing credit facilities or financing to the Corporation; or

(E) | Shares of Common Stock issued or issuable from time to
time pursuant to the acquisition of another business entity or business segment of any such entity
by the Corporation by merger, purchase of substantially all the assets or other reorganization
(other than a merger or other transaction described in Section 2(c)).

(iii) | In the event the Corporation should at any time or from time to
time after the Accrual Date fix a record date for the effectuation of a split or subdivision of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock or the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled
to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock or other
securities or rights convertible into, or entitling the holder thereof to receive directly or
indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock (hereinafter referred to as “Common Stock
Equivalents”) without payment of any consideration by such holder for the additional shares of
Common Stock or the Common Stock Equivalents (including the additional shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof), then, as of such record date (or the date of
such dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no record date is fixed), the Conversion Price of
the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B-1 Preferred Stock and Series B-2 Preferred Stock shall be
appropriately decreased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion
of each share of such Series shall be increased in proportion to such increase of the aggregate of
shares of Common Stock outstanding and those issuable with respect to such Common Stock
Equivalents with the number of shares issuable with respect to Common Stock Equivalents
determined from time to time in the manner provided for deemed issuances in subsection

A(c)(i)(D).

(iv) If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any time
after the Accrual Date is decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of Common
Stock, then, following the record date of such combination, the Conversion Price for the Series A
Preferred Stock, Series B-1 Preferred Stock and Series B-2 Preferred Stock shall be appropriately
increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of
such Series shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares. No
adjustment to the Conversion Price shall be made as a result of the Reverse Split.

(d) Recapitalizations. If at any time or from time to time there shall be a
recapitalization of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision, combination, reorganization or
merger or sale of assets transaction provided for elsewhere in this Section 4 or in Section 2),
provision shall be made so that the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B-1 Preferred
Stock and Series B-2 Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of
such Series, in lieu of each share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion, the
number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the Corporation or otherwise, to
which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion would
have been entitled upon such recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be
made in the application of the provisions of this Section 4 with respect to the rights of the holders
of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B-1 Preferred Stock and Series B-2 Preferred Stock after the

1]
recapitalization to the end that the provisions of this Section 4 (including adjustment of the
Conversion Price then in effect and the number of shares purchasable upon conversion of the
Series A Preferred Stock, Series B-1 Preferred Stock and Series B-2 Preferred Stock) shall be
applicable after that event as nearly equivalent as may be practicable.

(e) No Impairment. The Corporation shall not, by amendment of this
Certificate of Incorporation or through any reorganization, recapitalization, transfer of assets,
consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid
or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed
hereunder by the Corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all
the provisions of this Section 4 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or
appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holders of Preferred Stock set forth in
this Section 4 against impairment.

(f) No Fractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments.

(i) No fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of any
share or shares of Preferred Stock, and the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued shall
be rounded to the nearest whole share. Whether or not fractional shares are issuable upon such
conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock the
holder is at the time converting into Common Stock and the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon such aggregate conversion.

(ii) | Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the
Conversion Price of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B-1 Preferred Stock and Series B-2
Preferred Stock, pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation, at its expense, shal! promptly
compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and prepare and
furnish to each holder of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B-1 Preferred Stock and Series B-2
Preferred Stock, a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail
the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon the
written request at any time of any holder of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock,
furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (A) such adjustment
and readjustment, (B) the Conversion Price for such Series at the time in effect, and (C) the
number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property that at the time
would be received upon the conversion of such Series.

(g) Notices of Record Date. In the event of any taking by the Corporation of a
record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof
who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend) or other distribution, any
right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of stock of any class or any other
securities or property, or to receive any other right, the Corporation shall mail to each holder of
Preferred Stock, at least ten (10) days prior to the date specified therein, a notice specifying the
date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or
right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right.

(h) _ Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at
all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock,

12
solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of Preferred Stock, such number
of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock, in addition to such other remedies as shall be available to the holders
of Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate action as may be necessary to
increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall
be sufficient for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain
the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to this Certificate of
Incorporation.

(i) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Section 4 to be
given to the holders of Preferred Stock shall be deemed given if deposited in the United States
mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to each holder of record at his address appearing on the
books of the Corporation.

5. Voting Rights. The holder of each share of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B-1}
Preferred Stock and Series B-2 Preferred Stock shall have the right to one vote for each share of
Common Stock into which such Series A Preferred Stock, Series B-1 Preferred Stock or Series
B-2 Preferred Stock could then be converted, and with respect to such vote, such holder shall
have full voting rights and powers equal to the voting rights and powers of the holders of
Common Stock, and shall be entitled, notwithstanding any provision hereof, to notice of any
stockholders’ meeting in accordance with the Bylaws of the Corporation, and shall be entitled to
vote, together with holders of Common Stock, with respect to any question upon which holders
of Common Stock have the right to vote. Fractional votes shall not, however, be permitted and
any fractional voting rights available on an as-converted basis (after aggregating all shares into
which shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder could then be converted) shall be rounded to
the nearest whole number (with one-half being rounded upward).

6. Status of Converted or Redeemed Stock. In the event any shares of Preferred
Stock shall be redeemed or converted pursuant to Section 3 or Section 4 hereof, the shares so
converted or redeemed shall be cancelled and thereafter shall not be issuable. This Certificate of
Incorporation shall be deemed appropriately amended to effect the corresponding reduction in
the Corporation’s authorized capital stock.

preemptive rights as are granted in any agreement to which the Corporation and such holder are a
party.
