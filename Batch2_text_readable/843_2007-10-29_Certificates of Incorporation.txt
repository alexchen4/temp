persons). Such conversion is referred to as a “Special Automatic Conversion”.

Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock shall be retired and cancelled and may not be

number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock accordingly.

and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (without giving effect to the operation of Section
4(k)), unless the holders of at least a majority of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B
Preferred Stock, calculated as if the same had been converted into common stock at the
Conversion Price, elect, by written notice sent to the Corporation at least 10 days prior to the
consummation of the Qualified Financing, that such transaction not be treated as a Qualified
Financing for purposes of this Section 4(c).

(d) Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be
issued upon conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the
holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction
multiplied by the then fair market value of a share of Common Stock as determined by the
Board of Directors. For such purpose, all shares of Preferred Stock held by cach holder of
Preferred Stock shall be aggregated, and any resulting fractional share of Common Stock shall
be paid in cash. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same
into full shares of Common Stock, and to receive certificates therefor, he shall either
(A) surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the
Corporation or of any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock or (B) notify the Corporation or
its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and execute an
agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred
by it in connection with such certificates, and shall give written notice to the Corporation at
such office that he elects to convert the same; provided, however, that on the date of an
Automatic Conversion Event, the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted
automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the
certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent;
provided further, however, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates
evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such Automatic Conversion Event
unless either the certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are delivered to the
Corporation or its transfer agent as provided above, or the holder notifies the Corporation or
its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an
agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred
by it in connection with such certificates. On the date of the occurrence of an Automatic
Conversion Event, each holder of record of shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to be
the holder of record of the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, notwithstanding
that the certificates representing such shares of Preferred Stock shall not have been

surrendered at the office of the Corporation, that notice from the Corporation ghall not have
been received by any holder of record of shares of Preferred Stock, or that the certificates
evidencing such shares of Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered to such holder.

The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after such delivery, or after such
agreement and indemnification, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred
Stock, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which he shall
be entitled as aforesaid and a check payable to the holder in the amount of any cash amounts
payable as the result of a conversion into fractional shares of Common Stock, plus any
declared and unpaid dividends on the converted Preferred Stock. Such conversion shall be
deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such
surrender of the sharea of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled
to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all
purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date;
provided, however, that if the conversion is in connection with an underwritten offer of
securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act or a merger, sale, financing, or liquidation
of the Corporation or other event, the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering
Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing of such transaction or upon
the occurrence of such event, in which case the person(s) entitled to reccive the Common
Stock issuable upon such conversion of the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have
converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such transaction or

the occurence of such event.
