all holders of Preferred Stock, the remaining assets of the Corporation legally available
for distribution to the Corporation’s stockholders shall be distributed among the holders
of the shares of Preferred Stock and Common Stock, pro rata based on the number of

Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation immediately prior to such Liquidation
Event.

3. If the assets of the Corporation to be distributed to the holders of
Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit the payment in full of the Preferred
Liquidation Amount, then the assets of the Corporation legally available for distribution

voting power of (1) such surviving corporation or other entity or (2) if the surviving
corporation or other entity is a wholly owned subsidiary of another corporation or other
entity immediately following such merger or consolidation, the parent corporation or
other entity of such surviving corporation or other entity, provided that for the purpose of

consolidation or upon conversion or exchange of in-the-money Convertible Securities (as
hereinafter defined) outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation shall
be deemed to be outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation and, if
applicable, converted or exchanged in such merger or consolidation on the same terms as
the actual outstanding shares of Common Stock are converted or exchanged), (B) the
sale, lease, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Corporation, or (C) any purchase of shares of capital stock of the Corporation through a

with such Liquidation Event) is greater than the amount which such holder would be
entitled to receive pursuant to this Section C if such holder did not so convert such shares
into Common Stock, then such holder shall receive such greater amount pursuant to such
transaction in full satisfaction of all amounts to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
this Section C without first having so converted such shares into Common Stock.

pursuant to or otherwise be governed by the provisions of Section D in connection with
such Liquidation Event.

actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the

number of shares of Common Stock to which such holders shall be entitled upon
conversion, together with payment of any dividends declared but unpaid thereon and any
cash in lieu of any fraction of a share.

2. Automatic Conversion Upon Qualified Initial Public Offering.

Each outstanding share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into the

shares of Common Stock of which (i) the aggregate gross proceeds, before underwniting
discounts and commissions, attributable to sales for the account of the Corporation
exceed $50,000,000 and (ii) the per share price to the public is at least $49.1031 (as
adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations and the like) (a “Qualified
Public Offering”). Ifa closing of a Qualified Public Offering occurs, all outstanding

Stock immediately prior to such closing.

(i) As of, and in all cases subject to, the closing of a Qualified
Public Offering (the “Automatic Conversion Date”), all outstanding shares of Preferred
Stock shall be converted automatically into shares of Common Stock as set forth in
Section D hereof without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or
not the certificates representing such shares of Preferred Stock are surrendered to the
Corporation or its transfer agent. On the Automatic Conversion Date, all rights with
respect to the shares of Preferred Stock so converted, including the rights, if any, to
receive notices and to vote as holders of Preferred Stock, shall immediately cease and
terminate, except only the rights of the holders thereof to receive certificates for the
number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Preferred Stock have been

Affidavit of Loss thereof, and to receive payment of any dividends declared but unpaid
thereon. If so required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall
be endorsed or accompanicd by a written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form

certificates or Affidavit of Loss, the Corporation shall issue and deliver to such holder, in
its name as shown on such surrendered certificate or certificates, a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of the
Preferred Stock surrendered are convertible on the Automatic Conversion Date, together
with payment of any dividends declared but unpaid thereon and any cash in lieu of any
fraction of a share.

3. Fractional Shares. The Corporation shall not be obligated to
deliver to any holder of shares of Preferred Stock any fractional share of Common Stock

-8-
issuable upon any conversion of such shares (after aggregating all shares of Common
Stock into which all shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder could be converted),
but in lieu thereof may make a cash payment in respect thereof in any manner permitted
by law.

4. Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation
shal] at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of

Common Stock solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of
Preferred Stock such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be
sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock; and if at
any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be
sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, the
Corporation will take such corporate action as may be necessary to increase its authorized
but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for
such purpose.

E. Adjustments. The Series A Conversion Price and the Series B Conversion
Price, as applicable, in effect from time to time shall, unless waived in writing by the
holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of the applicable series of
Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, be subject to adjustment from and after the
date upon which shares of Serics B Preferred Stock, as applicable, are first issued by the
Corporation (the “Issuance Date’) as follows:

1. Dividends and Stock Splits. If, after the Issuance Date, the number
of shares of Common Stock outstanding is increased (i) by a stock dividend payable in
shares of Common Stock or (ii) by a subdivision or split-up of shares of Common Stock
without a comparable subdivision or split-up of the Preferred Stock, then, on the date
such payment is made or such change is effective, the Series A Conversion Price and the
Series B Conversion Price shall be appropriately decreased so that the number of shares
of Common Stock issuable on conversion of the shares of Preferred Stock shall be
increased in proportion to such increase of outstanding shares of Common Stock;
provided, however, that, in the case of clause (i) above, no such adjustment shall be made
to the Series A Conversion Price or the Series B Conversion Price if the holders of
Preferred Stock simultaneously receive (A) a dividend or other distribution of shares of
Common Stock in a number equal to the number of shares of Common Stock as they
would have received if all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock had been converted into
Common Stock on the date of such event or (B) a dividend or other distribution of shares
of Preferred Stock which are convertible, as of the date of such event, into such number
of shares of Common Stock as is equal to the number of additional shares of Common
Stock being issued with respect to each share of Common Stock in such dividend.

2. Reverse Stock Splits. If the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding at any time after the Issuance Date is decreased by a combination or reverse
split of the outstanding shares of Common Stock without a comparable combination or
reverse split of the Preferred Stock then, on the effective date of such combination or
reverse split, the Series A Conversion Price and the Series B Conversion Price shall be
appropriately increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on

-9-
conversion of the shares of Preferred Stock shall be decreased in proportion to such
decrease in outstanding shares of Common Stock.

3. Sale of Common Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any
time, or from time to time after the Issuance Date, issue, sell or exchange any shares of
Common Stock (including shares held in the Corporation’s treasury but excluding
Excluded Shares (as hereinafter defined) and excluding any shares of Common Stock

Convertible Securities, in each case provided such issuance is pursuant to the terms of
such Option or Convertible Security) without consideration or for a consideration per

(i) less than the Series A Conversion Price in cffect
immediately prior to the issuance, sale or exchange of such shares (any such issuance,
sale or exchange is hereafter referred to as a “Series A Dilutive Transaction”), then, and

shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Series A Dilutive
Transaction (excluding treasury shares but including all shares of Common Stock
issuable upon conversion, exchange or exercise of any outstanding shares of

of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Series A
Dilutive Transaction (excluding treasury shares but including all shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion, exchange or exercise of any

plus (Y) the number of such additional shares of Common Stock so issued in the
Series A Dilutive Transaction.

(ii) less than the Series B Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to the issuance, sale or exchange of such shares (any such issuance,
sale or exchange is hereafter referred to as a “Series B Dilutive Transaction”), then, and
thereafter successively upon each such Series B Dilutive Transaction, the Series B
Conversion Price shall forthwith be reduced to an amount determined by multiplying the
Series B Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction:

(1) the numerator of which shall be (X) the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Series B Dilutive
Transaction (excluding treasury shares but including all shares of Common Stock

-10-
issuable upon conversion, exchange or exercise of any outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock, Options or other Convertible Securities) plus (Y) the number of
shares of Common Stock which the net aggregate consideration received by the
Corporation for the total number of such additional shares of Common Stock so
issued in the Series B Dilutive Transaction would purchase at such Series B
Conversion Price (pnor to such adjustment): and

(2) the denominator of which shall be (X) the number
of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Series B
Dilutive Transaction (excluding treasury shares but including all shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion, exchange or exercise of any
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, Options or other Convertible Securities),
plus (Y) the number of such additional shares of Common Stock so issued in the

immediately prior to the issuance of such Options or Convertible Securities (the
“Series A Dilutive Convertible Securities”), the Series A Conversion Price shall
forthwith be reduced to an amount determined by multiplying the Series A Conversion
Price by a fraction:

(1) the numerator of which shall be (X) the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of such
Series A Dilutive Convertible Securities (excluding treasury shares but including
all shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion, exchange or exercise of
any outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, Options or other Convertible
Securities), plus (Y) the number of shares of Common Stock which the total
amount of consideration received or receivable by the Corporation for the
issuance of such Series A Dilutive Convertible Securities plus the minimum
amount, if any, set forth in the terms of such security as payable to the
Corporation upon the exercise, exchange or conversion thereof (such sum, the

“Series A Net Aggregate Consideration”) would purchase at such Series A
Conversion Price (prior to adjustment); and

(2) the denominator of which shall be (X) the number
of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of such
Series A Dilutive Convertible Securities (excluding treasury shares but including
all shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion, exchange or exercise of
any outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, Options or other Convertible
Securities), plus (Y) the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issuable
upon the conversion, exchange or exercise of all such Series A Dilutive
Convertible Securities (whether or not such Series A Dilutive Convertible
Securities are immediately exercisable, exchangeable or convertible).

(11) less than the Series B Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to the issuance of such Options or Convertible Securities (the
“Series B Dilutive Convertible Securities’’), the Serics B Conversion Price shall
forthwith be reduced to an amount determined by multiplying the Series B Conversion
Price by a fraction:

(1) the numerator of which shall be (X) the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of such

-]2-
Series B Dilutive Convertible Securities (excluding treasury shares but including
all shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion, exchange or exercise of
any outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, Options or other Convertible
Securities), plus (Y) the number of shares of Common Stock which the total
amount of consideration received or receivable by the Corporation for the
issuance of such Series B Dilutive Convertible Securities plus the minimum
amount. if any, set forth in the terms of such security as payable to the
Corporation upon the exercise, exchange or conversion thereof (such sum, the

‘Series B Net Aggregate Consideration’’) would purchase at such Series B
Conversion Price (prior to adjustment); and

(2) the denominator of which shall be (X) the number
of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of such
Series B Dilutive Convertible Securities (excluding treasury shares but including
all shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion, exchange or exercise of
any outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, Options or other Convertible
Securities), plus (Y) the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issuable
upon the conversion, exchange or exercise of all such Series B Dilutive
Convertible Securities (whether or not such Series B Dilutive Convertible
Securities are immediately exercisable, exchangeable or convertible).

5. Expiration or Change in Price. If the consideration per share
provided for in any Series A Dilutive Convertible Security or Series B Dilutive
Convertible Security (together, a “Dilutive Convertible Security’) giving rise to an
adjustment of the Series A Conversion Price or the Series B Conversion Price (together,
the “Conversion Price’’), or the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the
exercise, exchange or conversion of any such Dilutive Convertible Security changes at
any time, the applicable Conversion Price in effect at the time of such change shall be
readjusted to the applicable Conversion Price which would have been in effect at such
time had such Dilutive Convertible Securitics provided for such changed consideration
per share or changed number of shares (determined as provided in Section E.4 hercof) at
the time initially granted, issued or sold; provided that such adjustment of such
Conversion Price will be made only as and to the extent that such Conversion Price
effective upon such adjustment remains not greater than the Conversion Price that would
be in effect if such Dilutive Convertible Securities had not resulted in any adjustment of
the Conversion Price at the time initially granted, issued or sold or in connection with any
intervening changes thereto. Except as otherwise provided in this Section E.5, no further
adjustment of the applicable Conversion Price shall be made under this Section E upon
the actual issuance of any shares of Common Stock which are issued pursuant to the
exercise, conversion or exchange of any Dilutive Convertible Securitics if an adjustment
shall previously have been made upon the issuance of such Dilutive Convertible
Securities in accordance with Section E.4. If, as, and when the rights to acquire shares of
Common Stock upon exercise, exchange or conversion of the Dilutive Convertible
Securitics which gave rise to such adjustment expire or are canceled without having been
exercised, the Conversion Price in effect at the time of such expiration or cancellation
shall be readjusted to the Conversion Price which would have been in effect had the
expired or canceled Dilutive Convertible Securities not been issued.

-13-
6. Other Adjustments. In the event the Corporation shall make or
issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Common Stock
entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the
Corporation other than shares of Common Stock and the provisions of Section B do not
apply to such dividend or other distribution, then and in each such event lawful and
adequate provision shall be made so that the holders of shares of Preferred Stock shall
receive, upon conversion thereof in addition to the number of shares of Common Stock
receivable thereupon, the number and type of securities of the Corporation which they
would have received had their shares of Preferred Stock been converted into Common
Stock on the date of such event and had they thereafter, during the period from the date of
such event to and including the date of conversion, retained such securities receivable by
them as aforesaid during such period, giving application to all adjustments called for
during such period under this Section E as applied to such distributed securities;
provided, however, that no such provision shall be made if such holders of Preferred
Stock receive, simultaneously with the distribution to the holders of Common Stock, a
dividend or other distribution of such securities in an amount equal to the amount of such
securities as they would have received if al] outstanding shares of Preferred Stock had
been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event.

7. Reorganization, etc. If the Common Stock issuable upon the
conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or different number of
shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by reclassification or otherwise (other
than a subdivision or combination of shares, a stock dividend or a reorganization, merger
or consolidation provided for elsewhere in this Section E), then and in each such event
the holder of each share of Preferred Stock shal] have the nght to receive upon
conversion of the Preferred Stock the kind and amount of shares of stock and other
securities and property receivable upon such reorganization, reclassification or other
change by holders of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of
Preferred Stock might have been converted immediately prior to such reorganization,
reclassification or change, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein.

8. Mergers and Other Reorganizations. Subject to Section C, if at
any time or from time to time there shall be a capital reorganization of the Common

Stock (other than a subdivision, combination or reclassification provided for elsewhere in
this Section) or a merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into another
corporation, in each case in which the Common Stock (but not the Preferred Stock) is
converted or exchanged for stock, securities or other property, then, as part of and as a
condition to the effectivencss of such reorganization, merger or consolidation, lawful and
adequate provision shall be made so that the holders of shares of Preferred Stock shall
thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of the Preferred Stock, as the case may
be, the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the Corporation or of
the successor corporation resulting from such reorganization, merger or consolidation to
which a holder of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion would have been
entitled on such capital reorganization, merger or consolidation. In any such case,
appropriate provisions shall be made with respect to the rights of the holders of the shares
of Preferred Stock after the reorganization, merger or consolidation to the end that the
provisions of this Section (including, without limitation, provisions for adjustment of the

-14-
applicable Conversion Price and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the
Preferred Stock) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as may be, with respect to any
shares of stock, securities or assets to be deliverable thereafter upon the conversion of the
Preferred Stock.

9. Calculations. Solely for purposes of calculating any Conversion
Value or Conversion Price or calculating the number of shares of Common Stock into
which one share of Preferred Stock is convertible and otherwise subject in all cases to
Section D.3 hereof, all calculations under this Section E shal] be made 1o the nearest
thousandth (1/1000th) of a cent or to the nearest one hundredth (1/100th) of a share, as
the case may be.

10. Certificate. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section E, the Corporation at its
expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the
terms hereof and prepare and furnish to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate
setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which
such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon written request at
any time of any holder of shares of Preferred Stock furnish or cause to be furnished to
such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and readjustments, (ii) the
applicable Conversion Price before and after such adjustment or readjustment, and (iii)
the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which
at the time would be received upon the conversion of such holder’s shares of Preferred
Stock.

11. | Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this Section E,
the consideration received or receivable by the Corporation for the issuance of any shares
of Common Stock or any Options or Convertible Securities shall be computed as follows:

(i) Cash and Property. Such consideration shall:

(a) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
aggregate amount of cash received by the Corporation before deducting any reasonable
discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, pair or incurred by the Corporation
for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with such issuance;

(b) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair market value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors (including at least one of the Canaan Directors then in
office); and

(c) in the event shares of Common Stock are issued
together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for
consideration which covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received,
computed as provided in clauses (a) and (b) above, as reasonably determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors (including at least one of the Canaan Directors then in
office);

-15-
(ii) | Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per
share received by the Corporation for options or Convertible Securities deemed to have

been issued pursuant to Section E.4 shall be determined by dividing

(x) the total amount, if any, received or
receivable by the Corporation as consideration for the issue of such Options or
Convertible Securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration
(as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained
therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration) payable to the Corporation
upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Secumties, the exercise of such
Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities by

(y) the maximum number of shares of Common
Stock (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision
contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise
of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities.

F. Preferred Stock Covenants.

l. So long as any shares of Preferred Stock shall be outstanding, the
Corporation shall not take any action (whether by merger, recapitalization, reorganization
or otherwise), without first having obtained the affirmative vote or written consent of the
holders of at least 50% of the Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class on an as-
converted to Common Stock basis, that:

(1) alters or changes the rights, preferences or privileges of the
Preferred Stock or any series thereof;

(ii) | other than the issuance of shares of Series B Preferred
Stock pursuant to the Closing (as defined in the Stock Purchase Agreement) issues,
creates or authorizes any new class or series of securities, including, without limitation,
any security which has a preference over, or is offered with rights on a pari passu basis
with, the Preferred Stock; provided, however, that no such approval shall be required for
issuances of capital stock of the Corporation on no more than two separate instances for
aggregate consideration not to exceed $10,000,000 so long as such capital stock has
rights pari passu with the Preferred Stock and (i) such financings are approved by the
Board of Directors (including at least one of the Canaan Directors) in the exercise of its
fiduciary duties, (ii) such financings are made pursuant to a business plan approved by
the Board of Directors (including at least one of the Canaan Directors) and (ili) each
holder of Preferred Stock that is a Preferred Stock Investor (as defined in the
Stockholders Agreement) is offered the opportunity to participate in such financing
pursuant to Section 3 of the Stockholders Agreement;

(iii) reclassifies any outstanding shares into shares having nghts

-16-
(iv) amends, alters, repeals or waives any provision of, or adds
any provision to, this Certificate of Incorporation (including by merger or consolidation)
that modifies the rights of the Preferred Stock in an adverse manner;

(v) effects a material change in the Corporation's line of
business;

(vi) results in a transaction with any founder, officer or director

shares of the Common Stock or such other capital stock of the Corporation, as the case
may be;

(ix) | approves or effects a merger, consolidation, liquidation or
reorganization involving the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries or a sale, lease,
conveyance or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation,
including, without limitation, any Extraordinary Transaction (a “Change of Control
Event’); or

(x) change the number of directors constituting the Board of
Directors.

2. So long as any shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be
outstanding, the Corporation shall not take any action (whether by merger,
recapitalization, reorganization or otherwise) (x) that amends, alters or repeals any
provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws of the Corporation (including
pursuant to a merger) if such action would adversely alter the rights, preferences,
privileges or powers of, or restrictions provided for the benefit of the Series B Preferred
Stock without first having obtained the affirmative vote or written consent of the holders
of at least a majority of the Series B Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, to the
extent Delaware corporate law requires such approval or (y) that increases the authorized
number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock without first having obtained the
affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of at least a majority of the Series B
Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class.

G. Redemption.

1. Redemption Date and Price. If the Corporation has not
consummated a Qualified Public Offering on or prior to the sixth (6"") anniversary of the
Issuance Date, the Corporation shall, on a date (the “Initial Redemption Date”) no less
than 30 days and no more than 45 days after receipt by the Corporation of a written

-17-
request (2 “Redemption Election”) from the holders of at least 80% of the outstanding
Preferred Stock voting together as a single class on an as-converted to Common Stock
basis that all or a portion of the shares of Preferred Stock be redeemed, to the extent
permitted by Delaware law, redeem from each holder of shares of Preferred Stock that
requests redemption pursuant to a Redemption Election or pursuant to a subsequent
election made in accordance with Section G.2 below (a “Requesting Holder’), at a price
equal to the Serics A Redemption Price (as defined below) or the Series B Redemption
Price (as defined below), as applicable, one-half the number of shares of Preferred Stock
requested to be redeemed by such Requesting Holder. On the first anniversary of the
Initial Redemption Date (each of the Initial Redemption Date and such first anniversary,
a “Redemption Date’’), the Corporation shall redeem the remaining one-half the number
of shares of Preferred Stock requested to be redeemed by each Requesting Holder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, holders of at least 80% of the outstanding Preferred Stock
voting together as a single class on an as-converted to Common Stock basis may specify
in a Redemption Election that the Corporation is to redeem not only all or a portion of the
shares of Preferred Stock held by such requesting holders but that the Corporation also is
to redeem the same proportional amount of shares of Preferred Stock from all (but not
less than all) other holders of Preferred Stock, in which case all holders of Preferred
Stock will be treated as Requesting Holders hercunder. The Series A Redemption Price
shall equal $9.5864 (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations and the
like) plus declared and unpaid dividends. The Series B Redemption Price shal! equal
$16.3677 (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations and the like) plus
declared and unpaid dividends.

2. Procedure. Within 10 days following its receipt of the Redemption
Election, the Corporation shall mail a written notice, first class or registered mail postage
prepaid, to cach holder of record (at the close of business on the business day next
preceding the day on which notice is given) of Preferred Stock at the address last shown
on the records of the Corporation for such holder, notifying such holder of the
redemption to be effected, specifying the time, manner and place of redemption and the
Series A Redemption Price and the Series B Redemption Price (a “Redemption
Notice”). Each holder of Preferred Stock (other than a holder who has made the
Redemption Election) may elect to become a Requesting Holder on such Initial
Redemption Date by so indicating in a written notice mailed to the Corporation, by first
class or registered mail, postage prepaid, at least five (5) business days prior to the Initial
Redemption Date. Except as provided in Section G.3 below, on or after each
Redemption Date, each holder of Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall surrender to the
Corporation the certificate or certificates representing the sharcs to be redeemed on such
Redemption Date, in the manner and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice,
and thereupon the Series A Redemption Price or the Series B Redemption Price, as
applicable, of such shares shall be payable to the order of the person whose name appears
on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof and each surrendered certificate
shall be cancelled. In the event less than all the shares represented by any such certificate
are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemcd shares.

3. Insufficient Funds. If the funds of the Corporation legally
available for redemption of shares of Preferred Stock which shall have been called for

-18-
redemption on a Redemption Date are insufficient to redeem the total number of shares of
Preferred Stock called and submitted for redemption, those funds which are legally
available will be used to redeem the maximum possible number of whole shares ratably
among the holders of such shares in proportion to the amounts which such holders would
otherwise have been entitled to receive if all amounts payable on or with respect to such
shares had been paid in full. The shares of Preferred Stock not redeemed shall remain
outstanding and entitled to all rights and preferences provided herein. At any time
thereafter when additional funds of the Corporation are legally available for the
redemption of such shares of Preferred Stock, such funds will be used promptly to
redeem the balance of such shares, or such portion thereof for which funds are then
legally available, such payments to be made prior and in preference to any other
redemption payments. Notwithstanding the foregoing:

(1) in the event that the aggregate Series A Redemption Price
is not paid to all the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock within one (1) month after
any applicable Redemption Date, the Series A Redemption Price with respect to the
remaining shares of Series A Preferred Stock required to be redeemed (the “Remaining
Series A Shares”) shall be paid by the issuance of a promissory note (the ‘Series A
Note”) to holders of Remaining Series A Shares with a principal amount equal to (i) the
number of Remaining Series A Shares multiplied by (ii) the Series A Redemption Price.
The Series A Note shall have a term that expires within twelve (12) months of the initial
issuance thereof and shall provide for interest to be paid on the principal amount of the
Series A Note in an amount equal to twelve percent (12%) per annum; and

(ii) in the event that the aggregate Series B Redemption Price is
not paid to all the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock within one (1) month after any
applicable Redemption Date, the Series B Redemption Price with respect to the
remaining shares of Scries B Preferred Stock required to be redeemed (the “Remaining
Series B Shares’) shall be paid by the issuance of a promissory note (the “Series B
Note’) to holders of Remaining Series B Shares with a principal amount equal to (i) the
number of Remaining Series B Shares multiplied by (ii) the Series B Redemption Price.
The Series B Note shal! have a term that expires within twelve (12) months of the initial
issuance thereof and shall provide for interest to be paid on the principal amount of the
Series B Note in an amount equal to twelve percent (12%) per annum.

H. Notice.

I. Liquidation Events, Etc. In the event (i) the Corporation
establishes a record date to determine the holders of any class of securities who are
entitled to receive any dividend or other distribution, or who are entitled to vote at a
meeting (or by written consent) in connection with any of the transactions identified in
clause (ii) hereof, or (ii) any Liquidation Event, Extraordinary Transaction or Qualified
Public Offering becomes reasonably likely to occur, the Corporation shall send or cause
to be sent to each holder of shares of Preferred Stock at least twenty (20) days prior to
such record date specified therein or the expected effective date of any such transaction,
whichever is earlier (or such shorter period approved by the holders of at least a majority
of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock voting separately as a single class), a

-19-
notice specifying (A) the date of such record date for the purpose of such dividend or
distnbution or meeting or consent and a description of such dividend or distribution or

Liquidation Event, Extraordinary Transaction or Qualified Public Offering is expected to
become effective, and (C) the date on which the books of the Corporation shall close or a
record shall be taken with respect to any such event.

of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock voting together as a single class, may, at any
time upon written notice to the Corporation, waive any notice provisions specified herein
for the benefit of all holders of such Preferred Stock, and any such waiver shall be
binding upon all holders of shares of Preferred Stock.

3. General.

(i) In the event that the Corporation provides any notice, report
or statement gencrally to the holders of shares of Common Stock or any other class or
series of capital stock of the Corporation, the Corporation shall at the same time provide a
copy of any such notice, report or statement to each holder of outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock.

Corporation by reason of redemption, purchase, conversion or otherwise shall be
reissued, and all such shares shall be cancelled, retired and eliminated from the shares
which the Corporation shall be authorized to issue.

and as otherwise provided herein. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 242(b)(2)
of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the number of authorized shares of Common

General Corporation Law, and the Common Stock shall not be entitled to any separate
class vote on any such increase or decrease.
