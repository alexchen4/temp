C. Designated Preferred Stock.

The powers, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to and imposed on the
Series A Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock, the Series C Preferred Stock and Series S
Preferred Stock are as follows:

1. Dividends. (a) The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series B

in preference to any dividend on Common Stock or other Preferred Stock at the rate of $0.08 per
share (the “Base Series A Dividend”), $0.092 per share (the “Base Series B Dividend”) and
$0.1016 per share (the “Base Series C Dividend”) (each such dividend rate as adjusted for any
stock dividends, combinations or splits with respect to such shares) per annum, respectively,
payable out of funds legally available therefor. The Senior Preferred Stock dividends shall
accrue and be cumulative beginning on the date of issuance of such shares and shall be payable
only when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
dividends shall accrue (i) on the Series A Preferred Stock after the occurrence of a Series A
Seven Times Liquidity Event (as hereinafter defined) with respect to such series of Preferred
Stock or the closing of the sale of the Corporation’s Preferred Stock or securities convertible into
Preferred Stock at a purchase price of seven times the Series A Original Issue Price (as
hereinafter defined) or more per share of Preferred Stock (including, in the case of convertible
securities, the amount of additional consideration payable to the Corporation upon exercise or
conversion of such convertible securities); (ii) on the Series B Preferred Stock after the
occurrence of a Series B Seven Times Liquidity Event (as hereinafter defined) with respect to
such series of Preferred Stock or the closing of the sale of the Corporation’s Preferred Stock or
securities convertible into Preferred Stock at a purchase price of seven times the Series B
Original Issue Price (as hereinafter defined) or more per share of Preferred Stock (including, in
the case of convertible securities, the amount of additional consideration payable to the
Corporation upon exercise or conversion of such convertible securities); or (iii) on the Series C
Preferred Stock after the occurrence of a Series C Six Times Liquidity Event (as hereinafter
defined) with respect to such series of Preferred Stock or the closing of the sale of the

3

#1037960_9.DOC
C€200818200047

Corporation’s Preferred Stock or securities convertible into Preferred Stock at a purchase price of
six times the Series C Original Issue Price (as hereinafter defined) or more per share of Preferred
Stock (including, in the case of convertible securities, the amount of additional consideration
payable to the Corporation upon exercise or conversion of such convertible securities). Only
when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors, the holders of the Series S Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to receive dividends prior and in preference to any dividend on Common Stock
at the rate of $0.451928 per share (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations or splits
with respect to such shares) per annum, respectively, payable out of funds legally available
therefor. The Series S Preferred Stock dividends shall be non-cumulative. No dividends shall be
paid on any share of Series S Preferred Stock during any fiscal year of the Corporation until
dividends in the total amount of $0.08 per share, $0.092 per share and $0.1016 per share (as
adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations or splits with respect to such shares) on the Series
A Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock, and the Series C Preferred Stock, respectively,
shall have been paid or declared and set apart during that fiscal year. No dividends (other than
those payable solely in Common Stock of the Corporation) shall be paid on any share of
Common Stock during any fiscal year of the Corporation until dividends in the total amount of
$0.08 per share, $0.092 per share, $0.1016 per share and $0.451928 per share (as adjusted for any
stock dividends, combinations or splits with respect to such shares) on the Series A Preferred
Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock, the Series C Preferred Stock, and Series S Preferred Stock,
respectively, shall have been paid or declared and set apart during that fiscal year. Subject to the
foregoing and in the event dividends are paid on any share of Common Stock, the dividend shall
be paid with respect to all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred
Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and Series S Preferred Stock in an amount equal per share (on an
as-if-converted to Common Stock basis) to the amount paid or set aside for each share of
Common Stock.

(b) In the event the Corporation shall declare a distribution (other than any
distribution described in Article IV, Section C.2) payable in securities of other persons, evidences
of indebtedness issued by the Corporation or other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or
options or rights to purchase any such securities or evidences of indebtedness, then, in each such
case, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock, the Series C
Preferred Stock and Series S Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any such
distribution as though the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock,
the Series C Preferred Stock and Series S Preferred Stock were the holders of the number of
shares of Common Stock of the Corporation into which their respective shares of Preferred Stock
are convertible as of the record date fixed for the determination of the holders of Common Stock
of the Corporation entitled to receive such distribution.

2. Liquidation Preference.

(a) Rights on Liquidation.

(1) In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary (a “Liquidation Event’), the holders of the Series

4

#1037960_9.DOC
C€200818200047

A Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock and the Series C Preferred Stock, respectively,
shall be entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any distribution of any of the assets or
surplus funds of the Corporation to the holders of Common Stock, the Series S Preferred Stock
and any other series of Preferred Stock the terms of which specifically provide that such series
ranks junior and subordinate to the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock and the
Series C Preferred Stock with respect to the distribution of assets upon any liquidation or deemed
liquidation, an amount equal to (1) One Dollar ($1.00) per share (as adjusted for any stock
dividends, combinations and splits with respect to such shares) (the “Series A Original Issue
Price”) plus all accrued or declared but unpaid dividends on such share for each share of Series
A Preferred Stock then held by them; (ii) an amount equal to One Dollar Fifteen Cents ($1.15)
per share (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations and splits with respect to such
shares) (the “Series B Original Issue Price”), plus all accrued or declared but unpaid dividends
on such share for each share of Series B Preferred Stock held by them; and (iii) an amount equal
to One Dollar Twenty-Seven Cents ($1.27) per share (as adjusted for any stock dividends,
combinations and splits with respect to such shares) (the “Series C Original Issue Price”), plus
all accrued or declared but unpaid dividends on such share for each share of Series C Preferred
Stock held by them. If upon a Liquidation Event, the assets and funds thus distributed among the
holders of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock shall
be insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full preferential amount, then the
entire assets and funds of the Corporation legally available for distribution shall be distributed
ratably among the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock and the
Series C Preferred Stock in proportion to the preferential amount each such holder is otherwise
entitled to receive; provided, however, that no preference pursuant to this Article IV, Section
C.2(a)(i) shall be paid to (i) any holders of Series A Preferred Stock if the proceeds of any
Liquidation Event payable to such holders pursuant to Article IV, Section C.2(b) below would be
greater than seven times (7x) the Series A Original Issue Price, assuming no payment is required
to be made pursuant to this Article IV, Section C.2(a)(i) (a “Series A Seven Times Liquidity
Event”); (ii) any holders of Series B Preferred Stock if the proceeds of any Liquidation Event
payable to such holders pursuant to Article IV, Section C.2(b) below would be greater than seven
times (7x) the Series B Original Issue Price, assuming no payment is required to be made
pursuant to this Article IV, Section C.2(a)(i) (a “Series B Seven Times Liquidity Event”); or
(iii) any holders of Series C Preferred Stock if the proceeds of any Liquidation Event payable to
such holders pursuant to Article TV, Section C.2(b) below would be greater than six times (6x)
the Series C Original Issue Price, assuming no payment is required to be made pursuant to this
Article IV, Section C.2(a)(1) (a “Series C Six Times Liquidity Event’).

(11) In a Liquidation Event, after payment in full of the preferential
amounts payable to the holders of the Senior Preferred Stock pursuant to Article IV, Section
C.2(a)(i), the holders of the Series S Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, prior and in
preference to any distribution of any of the assets or surplus funds of the Corporation to the
holders of Common Stock with respect to the distribution of assets upon any liquidation or
deemed liquidation, an amount equal to $5.6491 per share (as adjusted for any stock dividends,
combinations and splits with respect to such shares) (the “Series S Original Issue Price’) plus
all accrued or declared but unpaid dividends on such share for each share of Series S Preferred

5

#1037960_9.DOC
C200818200047

Stock then held by them. If upon a Liquidation Event, after payment in full of the preferential
amounts payable to the holders of the Senior Preferred Stock, the assets and funds thus
distributed among the holders of Series S Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit the
payment to such holders of the full preferential amount, then the entire remaining assets and
funds of the Corporation legally available for distribution shall be distributed ratably among the
holders of the Series S Preferred Stock in proportion to the preferential amount each such holder
is otherwise entitled to receive.

(b) Distribution of Remaining Assets. After payment to the holders of the
Senior Preferred Stock and the Series S Preferred Stock the amounts set forth in Article IV,
Section C.2(a) above (unless the proviso in the ultimate sentence of Article IV, Section C.2(a)(i)
shall apply with respect to any series of Senior Preferred Stock, in which case no payment is
required to be made pursuant to such section with respect to such series of Senior Preferred
Stock), the entire remaining assets and funds of the Corporation legally available for distribution,
if any, shall be distributed among the holders of the Common Stock, Series A Preferred Stock,
Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock in proportion to the shares of Common
Stock then held by them and the shares of Common Stock which they then have the night to
acquire upon conversion of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, and
Series C Preferred Stock held by them.

(c) Certain Other Transactions. For purposes of this Article IV, Section C.2,
at the option of the holders of a majority of the Senior Preferred Stock, voting together as a single
class, a Liquidation Event shall be deemed to be occasioned by, or to include, (A) any transaction
or series of transactions which results in the disposition to a single person or group of affiliated
persons of greater than fifty percent (50%) of the voting power of the Corporation, (B) any
acquisition of the Corporation effected by means of merger, consolidation, share exchange or
other form of corporate reorganization in which outstanding shares of the Corporation are
exchanged for securities or other consideration issued, or caused to be issued, by the acquiring
corporation or its affiliate or (C) a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation
(each such event, a “Combination’”).

(d) Valuation of Non-Cash Assets. Whenever the distribution provided for in
this Article IV, Section C.2 shall be payable in securities or property other than cash, the value of
such distribution shall be the fair market value of such securities or other property as determined
in good faith by the Board of Directors.

3. Voting Rights.

herein, the shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock

immediately after the close of business on the record date fixed for such meeting, or on the
effective date of such written consent, as shall be equal to the number of whole shares of
Common Stock into which all of his or her shares of such series of Preferred Stock are
convertible immediately after the close of business on the record date fixed for such meeting or
the effective date of such written consent.

(b) Restrictions and Limitations. In addition to any other rights provided by
law, and notwithstanding any provision in these Articles of Incorporation to the contrary, so long
as at least an aggregate of One Million (1,000,000) shares of Senior Preferred Stock remain

to repurchase such shares upon the occurrence of certain events at a price per share equal to the
original issue price thereof);

4, Conversion. The holders of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series
B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and the Series S Preferred Stock shall have
conversion rights as follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of each series of Preferred Stock shall be
convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share
at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for such stock. Each share of each series of
Preferred Stock shall be converted into the number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of
Common Stock as is determined by dividing the “Conversion Price” per share in effect for such
series of Preferred Stock at the time of conversion into the “Conversion Value” per share for
such series of Preferred Stock. The number of shares of Common Stock into which each share of
such series of Preferred Stock is convertible is hereinafter referred to as the “Conversion Rate.”
As of the date of the filing of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (the
“Effective Date”), the Conversion Price per share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be One
Dollar ($1.00). As of the Effective Date, the Conversion Price per share of Series B Preferred
Stock shall be One Dollar Fifteen Cents ($1.15). As of the Effective Date, the Conversion Price
per share of Series C Preferred Stock shall be One Dollar Twenty-Seven Cents ($1.27). As of the
Effective Date, the Conversion Price per share of Series S Preferred Stock shall be $5.6491. The
Conversion Price of the Senior Preferred Stock set forth in this Article IV, Section C.4(a) shall be

8

#1037960_9.DOC
C€200818200047

subject to adjustment as set forth in Article IV, Section C.4(d)-(f).. The Conversion Price of the
Series S Preferred Stock set forth in this Article IV, Section C.4(a) shall be subject to adjustment
as set forth in Article IV, Section C.4(e)-(f. The Conversion Value per share of Series A
Preferred Stock shall be One Dollar ($1.00). The Conversion Value per share of Series B
Preferred Stock shall be One Dollar Fifteen Cents ($1.15). The Conversion Value per share of
Series C Preferred Stock shall be One Dollar Twenty-Seven Cents ($1.27). The Conversion
Value per share of Series S Preferred Stock shall be $5.6491. Any accrued or declared but
unpaid dividends on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C
Preferred Stock or Series S Preferred Stock may be converted into the number of shares of
Common Stock equal to the amount of the accrued or declared but unpaid dividends divided by
the Conversion Price per share of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C
Preferred Stock or Series S Preferred Stock, respectively.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of each series of Preferred Stock shall
automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the then-effective Conversion Rate
for such series of Preferred Stock (i) immediately upon the closing of the sale of the
Corporation’s Common Stock in a firm commitment, underwritten public offering registered
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), at a public offering price
(prior to underwriters’ discounts and expenses) equal to or exceeding Seven Dollars ($7.00) per
share of Common Stock (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations or splits with respect
to such shares) and the aggregate gross proceeds to the Corporation (before deduction for
underwriters’ discounts and expenses relating to the issuance) of which equal or exceed Thirty
Million Dollars ($30,000,000) (a “Qualified IPO”); or (ii) at the option of holders of a majority
of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock
voting together as a single class.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of shares of any series of
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock, the holder
shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the
Corporation or of any transfer agent for such stock, and shall give written notice to the
Corporation at such office that he or she elects to convert the same and shall state therein the
name or names in which he or she wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common
Stock to be issued. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at
such office to such holder of shares of Preferred Stock a certificate or certificates for the number
of shares of Common Stock to which he or she shall be entitled. Such conversion shall be
deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of surrender of
the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the
record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date. If the conversion is in
connection with an underwritten offering of securities pursuant to the Securities Act, the
conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering shares of Preferred Stock for conversion,
be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to such
offering, in which event the person or persons entitled to receive the Common Stock upon
conversion of the shares of Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such shares of

9

#1037960_9.DOC
C€200818200047

Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities. Notwithstanding
that any certificate for shares of any series of Preferred Stock to be converted in a mandatory
conversion pursuant to Section C.4(b) shall not have been surrendered as of the date fixed for
conversion, each holder of shares of each series of Preferred Stock shall thereafter be treated for
all purposes as the record holder of the number of shares of Common Stock issuable to such
holder upon conversion.

(d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock. The Conversion Price
of the Senior Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as set forth below.

(i) Special Definitions. For purposes of this Article IV, Section
C.4(d), the following definitions apply:

(1) “Additional Shares of Common Stock” shall mean all
shares of Common Stock issued (or, pursuant to Article IV, Section C.4(d)(iv), deemed to be
issued) by the Corporation after the Original Issue Date, other than shares of Common Stock
issued or issuable:

(A) upon conversion of shares of Series A Preferred
Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock or Series S Preferred Stock;

(B) to officers, directors or employees of, or consultants
to, the Corporation pursuant to stock option or stock purchase plans or agreements or other stock
incentive plans or arrangements on terms approved by the Board of Directors, but not exceeding
an aggregate of four million six hundred five thousand five hundred three (4,605,503) shares of
Common Stock, subject to adjustment for all subdivisions and combinations, which may be
issued from time to time, without the prior approval of a majority of holders of the Senior
Preferred Stock voting together as a single class;

(C) as a dividend or distribution to all holders of Series
A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and Series S Preferred

herein;

(D) upon exercise of warrants issued to banks or other
lenders or to equipment lessors in connection with a loan or equipment lease approved by the
Board of Directors;

(E) upon issuance of warrants to Teweles, Stacey,
Cavey & Moonie LLC (or any successor thereto) to purchase up to 75,000 shares of Common
Stock or upon the exercise thereof;

(F) in connection with business combinations or

corporate partnering agreements approved by the Board of Directors, including a majority of the
10

#1037960_9.DOC
C€200818200047

directors appointed by the holders of the Senior Preferred Stock;

(G) pursuant to the Series C Preferred Stock Purchase
Agreement dated as of December 22, 2005, as amended by the First Amendment to the Series C
Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of March 30, 2007;

(H) for which adjustment of the Conversion Price for
each affected series of Preferred Stock is made pursuant to Article IV, Section C.4(e); or

(1) as to which the holders of a majority of the then-
outstanding shares of Senior Preferred Stock, voting together as a separate class, agree in writing,
whether prospectively or retroactively, that such shares shall not constitute Additional Shares of
Common Stock.

(2) “Convertible Securities” shall mean any evidences of
indebtedness, shares or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock.

(3) “Original Issue Date” shall mean, with respect to each
series of Senior Preferred Stock, the date on which shares of such series of Senior Preferred
Stock were first issued;

(4) “Original Issue Price” shall mean the Series A Original
Issue Price, the Series B Original Issue Price, the Series C Original Issue Price or the Series S
Original Issue Price, as applicable;

(4) “Options” shall mean rights, options or warrants to
subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire either Common Stock or Convertible Securities.

(ii) | No Adjustment of Conversion Price. Any provision herein to the
contrary notwithstanding, no adjustment in the Conversion Price for any series of Senior
Preferred Stock shall be made in respect of the issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock
unless the consideration per share (determined pursuant to Article IV, Section C.4(d)(v) hereof)
for an Additional Share of Common Stock issued or deemed to be issued by the Corporation is
less than the Conversion Price for such series of Senior Preferred Stock in effect on the date of,
and immediately prior to, such issue.

(iii) | Adjustment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional
Shares of Common Stock. In the event this Corporation, (A) after the Original Issue Date, shall

issue Additional Shares of Common Stock (including Additional Shares of Common Stock
deemed to be issued pursuant to Article IV, Section C.4(d)(iv)) without consideration or for a
consideration per share less than the Conversion Price with respect to any series of Senior
Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such issue, or (B) after the Series S Original Issue
Date and prior to the first anniversary of the Series S Original Issue Date, shall issue Additional
Shares of Common Stock (including Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued

11

#1037960_9.DOC
C€200818200047

pursuant to Article IV, Section C.4(d)(iv)) without consideration or for a consideration per share
less than the Conversion Price with respect to the Series S Preferred Stock in effect immediately
prior to such issue, then and in such event, the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred
Stock shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest cent)
determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be
the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the
number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration received by the
Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued would
purchase at such Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance, and the
denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to such issue plus the number of such Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued. For
the purpose of the above calculation, the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to such issue shall be calculated on a fully diluted basis, as if all shares of
Preferred Stock and all Convertible Securities had been fully converted into shares of Common
Stock immediately prior to such issuance and any outstanding Options had been fully exercised
immediately prior to such issuance (and the resulting securities fully converted into shares of
Common Stock, if so convertible) as of such date.

(iv) Deemed Issue_of Additional Shares of Common Stock. In the
event the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall issue
any Options or Convertible Securities or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders
of any class of securities then entitled to receive any such Options or Convertible Securities, then
the maximum number of shares (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto without regard to
any provisions contained therein designed to protect against dilution) of Common Stock issuable
upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities and Options therefor,
the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities and Options, shall be deemed to be
Additional Shares of Common Stock issued as of the time of such issue or, in case such a record
date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, provided that in any
such case in which Additional Shares of Common Stock are deemed to be issued:

(1) no further adjustments in the Conversion Price of the
Preferred Stock shall be made upon the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities or shares of
Common Stock upon the exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities;

(2) if such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms
provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any increase or decrease in the consideration
payable to the Corporation, or decrease or increase in the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, the Conversion Price of each series
of Preferred Stock computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record
date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon any such
increase or decrease becoming effective, be recomputed to reflect such increase or decrease
insofar as it affects such Options or the rights of conversion or exchange under such Convertible
Securities (provided, however, that no such adjustment of the Conversion Price shall affect

12

#1037960_9.DOC
C€200818200047

Common Stock previously issued upon conversion of shares of the Preferred Stock);

(3) upon the expiration of any such Options or any rights of
conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have been exercised,
the Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock, computed upon the original issue thereof (or
upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based
thereon, shall, upon such expiration, be recomputed as if:

(A) _ in the case of Convertible Securities or Options for
Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common Stock issued were the shares of
Common Stock, if any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities and the consideration received therefor was the
consideration actually received by the Corporation for the issue of all such Options, whether or
not exercised, plus the consideration actually received by the Corporation upon such exercise, or
for the issue of all such Convertible Securities which were actually converted or exchanged, plus
the additional consideration, if any, actually received by the Corporation upon such conversion or
exchange; and

(B) _ in the case of Options for Convertible Securities,
only the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were issued at
the time of issue of such Options, and the consideration received by the Corporation for the
Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been then issued was the consideration
actually received by the Corporation for the issue of all such Options, whether or not exercised,
plus the consideration deemed to have been received by the Corporation (determined pursuant to
Article IV, Section C.4(d)(v)) upon the issue of the Convertible Securities with respect to which
such Options were actually exercised;

(4) no readjustment pursuant to clause (2) or (3) above shall
have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock to an amount
which exceeds the lower of (a) the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock on the
original adjustment date or (b) the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock that would
have resulted from any issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock between the original
adjustment date and such readjustment date;

(5) in the case of any Options which expire by their terms not
more than thirty (30) days after the date of issue thereof, no adjustment of the Conversion Price
of any series of Preferred Stock shall be made until the expiration or exercise of all such Options,
whereupon such adjustment shall be made in the same manner provided in clause (3) above; and

(6) if any such record date shall have been fixed and such
Options or Convertible Securities are not issued on the date fixed therefor, the adjustment
previously made in the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock which became
effective on such record date shall be cancelled as of the close of business on such record date
and shall instead be made on the actual date of issuance, if any.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this Article IV,
Section C.4(d), the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional
Shares of Common Stock shall be computed as follows:

(1) Cash and property. Such consideration shall:

(A) _ insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
aggregate amount of cash received by the Corporation excluding amounts paid or payable for
accrued interest or accrued dividends;

(B) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors; and

(C) in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock
are issued together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for
consideration which covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed
as provided in clauses (A) and (B) above, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(2) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per
share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been
issued pursuant to Article IV, Section C.4(d)(iv) relating to Options and Convertible Securities
shall be determined by dividing:

(A) _ the total amount, if any, received or receivable by
the Corporation as consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the
minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating
thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein designed to protect against dilution)
payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of
such Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of
such Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, by

(B) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock
(as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein
designed to protect against dilution) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities.

(e) Adjustments to Conversion Prices for Stock Dividends and __ for
Combinations or Subdivisions of Common Stock. In the event that the Corporation at any time
or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall declare or pay, without consideration, any
dividend on the Common Stock payable in Common Stock or in any right to acquire Common
Stock for no consideration, or shall effect a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common

14

#1037960_9.DOC
C€200818200047

Stock into a greater number of shares of Common Stock (by stock split, reclassification or
otherwise than by payment of a dividend in Common Stock or in any right to acquire Common
Stock), or in the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined or
consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock,
then the Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such
event shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such event, be proportionately decreased or
increased, as appropriate. In the event that this Corporation shall declare or pay, without
consideration, any dividend on the Common Stock payable in any right to acquire Common
Stock for no consideration, then the Corporation shall be deemed to have made a dividend
payable in Common Stock in an amount of shares equal to the maximum number of shares
issuable upon exercise of such rights to acquire Common Stock.

(f) Adjustments for Reclassification_and Reorganization. If the Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock,
the Series C Preferred Stock and the Series S Preferred Stock, shall be changed into the same or a
different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock, whether by capital
reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares
provided for in Article IV, Section C.4(e) above or a Combination treated as a liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation under Article IV, Section C.2(c) above), the
Conversion Price of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock, the Series C
Preferred Stock and the Series S$ Preferred Stock then in effect shall, concurrently with the
effectiveness of such reorganization or reclassification, be proportionately adjusted so that shares
of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and the Series S
Preferred Stock shall be convertible into, in lieu of the number of shares of Common Stock, or
other securities or property, which the holders would otherwise have been entitled to receive, a
number of shares of such other class or classes of stock equivalent to the number of shares of
Common Stock that would have been subject to receipt by the holders upon conversion of the
shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and Series
S Preferred Stock immediately before that change.

(g) Certificates as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Article IV,
Section C.4, the Corporation at its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or
readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and prepare and furnish to each holder of such
series of Preferred Stock a certificate executed by the Corporation’s President or Chief Executive
Officer setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which
such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon the written request at any
time of any holder of shares of any series of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to
such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and readjustments, (ii) the
Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock at the time in effect, and (iii) the number of
shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be
received upon the conversion of shares of such series of Preferred Stock.

(h) Notices of Record Date. In the event that the Corporation shall propose at

15

#1037960_9.DOC
C€200818200047

any time (i) to declare any dividend or distribution upon its Common Stock (other than by
purchase of shares of Common Stock of employees, officers or directors of, or consultants to, the
Corporation pursuant to the termination of such person’s status as such or pursuant to the
Corporation’s exercise of rights of first refusal with respect to its shares), whether in cash,
property, stock or other securities, whether or not a regular cash dividend and whether or not out
of earnings or earned surplus; (ii) to offer for subscription pro rata to the holders of any class or
series of its stock any additional shares of stock of any class or series or other rights; (ili) to effect
any reclassification or recapitalization of its Common Stock outstanding involving a change in
the Common Stock; or (iv) to merge, consolidate or effect a share exchange or other combination
with or into any other corporation, or sell, lease or convey all or substantially all of its assets, or
to liquidate, dissolve or wind up; then, in connection with each such event, the Corporation shall
send to the holders of shares of each series of Preferred Stock:

(1) at least twenty (20) days’ prior written notice of the date on
which a record shall be taken for such dividend, distribution or subscription rights (and
specifying the date on which the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled thereto) or for
determining rights to vote, if any, in respect of the matters referred to in (iii) and (iv) above,
which notice may be waived in writing by the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding
shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock; and

(2) in the case of the matters referred to in (iii) and (iv) above,
at least twenty (20) days’ prior written notice of the date when the same shall take place (and
specifying the date on which the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to exchange their
Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon the occurrence of such event),
which notice may be waived in writing by the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding
shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock.

(i) Issue Taxes. The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and other taxes
that may be payable in respect of any issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock on mandatory
conversion of shares of any series of Preferred Stock pursuant hereto, provided, however, that the
Corporation shall not be obligated to pay any transfer taxes resulting from any transfer requested
by any holder in connection with any such conversion.

Qj) Reservation of Common Stock Issuable Upon Conyersion. The
Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares
of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of each series
of Preferred Stock, such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be
sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of each series of Preferred Stock; and
if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be
sufficient to effect the conversion of all then-outstanding shares of such series of Preferred Stock,
the Corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary
to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as
shall be sufficient for such purpose, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to
obtain the requisite shareholder approval of any necessary amendment to these Articles of

16

#1037960_9.DOC
C€200818200047

Incorporation.

(k) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued
upon the conversion of any share or shares of any series of Preferred Stock. All shares of
Common Stock (including fractions thereof) issuable upon conversion of more than one share of
any series of Preferred Stock by a holder thereof shall be aggregated for purposes of determining
whether the conversion would result in the issuance of any fractional share. If, after the
aforementioned aggregation, the conversion would result in the issuance of a fraction of a share
of Common Stock, the Corporation shall, in lieu of issuing any fractional share, pay the holder
otherwise entitled to such fraction a sum in cash equal to the fair market value of such fraction on
the date of conversion (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors).

(1) Multiple Issuance Dates. Notwithstanding anything in this Article IV,
Section C.4 to the contrary, in the event the Corporation issues shares of the same series of
Preferred Stock on more than one date, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted only once for the
issuance of shares of such series of Preferred Stock, such adjustment to occur upon the earlier of
(i) one hundred twenty (120) days after the first issuance thereof, (ii) upon the final closing of the
issuance thereof or (iii) immediately prior to any conversion or repurchase of such Preferred
Stock.

(m) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Article IV, Section
C.4 to be given to the holders of shares of any series of Preferred Stock shall be deemed given if
deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, or if sent by facsimile or delivered
personally by hand or nationally recognized courier and addressed to each holder of record at
such holder’s address or facsimile number appearing in the records of the Corporation.

5. Redemption.

(a) Commencing on or after the fifth (Sth) anniversary of the first issuance of
the Series C Preferred Stock, upon the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than two-thirds
(2/3) of the then-outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and
Series C Preferred Stock voting together as a single class, the Corporation shall redeem, from any
source of funds legally available therefor, the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred
Stock and the Series C Preferred Stock in three (3) equal annual installments of one-third (1/3) of
the remaining outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock
and the Series C Preferred Stock commencing on the date that is one year from the notice of
redemption (each a “Redemption Date”). The Corporation shall effect such redemptions on the
applicable Redemption Dates by paying in cash in exchange for the shares of the Series A
Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock and the Series C Preferred Stock to be redeemed a
sum equal to the greater of (i) the Original Issue Price for such series of Preferred Stock plus all
accrued or declared but unpaid dividends on such shares or (ii) the fair market value of the shares
of the Preferred Stock as of the applicable Redemption Date as determined below (the
“Redemption Price”).

17

#1037960_9.DOC
C€200818200047

The fair market value shall be determined by the Board of Directors in good faith,
including the Director appointed by the holders of the Common Stock and a majority of the
Directors appointed by the holders of the Preferred Stock; provided, however, that if the Director
appointed by the holders of the Common Stock and the Directors appointed by the holders of the
Preferred Stock are unable to agree as to the fair market value of the shares of the Preferred
Stock, then the fair market value shall be determined by an appraiser appointed by the
disinterested members of the Board of Directors.

Any redemption effected pursuant to this Article IV, Section C.5(a) shall be made on a
pro rata basis among the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and
Series C Preferred Stock in proportion to the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock, respectively, then held by them.

(b) At least fifteen (15) but no more than thirty (30) days prior to each
Redemption Date, written notice shall be mailed, first class postage prepaid, to each holder of
record (at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is
given) of shares of each series of Preferred Stock to be redeemed at the address last shown on the
records of the Corporation for such holder, notifying such holder of the redemption to be
effected, specifying the number of shares to be redeemed from such holder, the Redemption
Date, the Redemption Price and the place at which payment may be obtained and calling upon
such holder to surrender to the Corporation, in the manner and at the place designated, his or her
certificate or certificates representing the shares to be redeemed (the “Redemption Notice”).
Except as provided in Article IV, Section C.5(c), on or after the Redemption Date, each holder of
shares of each series of Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall surrender to the Corporation the
certificate or certificates representing such shares, in the manner and at the place designated in
the Redemption Notice, and thereupon the Redemption Price of such shares shall be payable to
the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner
thereof and each surrendered certificate shall be canceled. In the event less than all the shares
represented by any such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing
the unredeemed shares.

(c) From and after the payment of the Redemption Price, all rights of the
holder of shares of any series of Preferred Stock designated for redemption in the Redemption
Notice as a holder of shares of Preferred Stock shall cease with respect to such shares, and such
shares shall not thereafter be transferred on the books of the Corporation or be deemed to be
outstanding for any purpose whatsoever. If the funds of the Corporation legally available for
redemption of shares of each series of Preferred Stock on any Redemption Date are insufficient
to redeem the total number of shares of each series of Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such
date, those funds which are legally available will be used to redeem the maximum possible
number of such shares ratably among the holders of such shares to be redeemed based upon their
holdings of shares of each series of Preferred Stock. The shares of any series of Preferred Stock
not redeemed shall remain outstanding and entitled to all the rights and preferences provided
herein. At any time thereafter when additional funds of the Corporation are legally available for
the redemption of shares of each series of Preferred Stock, such funds will immediately be used

18

#1037960_9.DOC
C€200818200047

to redeem the balance of the shares which the Corporation has become obliged to redeem on any
Redemption Date, but which it has not redeemed.

6. No Reissuance of Preferred Stock. No share or shares of any series of
Preferred Stock acquired by the Corporation by reason of redemption, purchase, conversion or
otherwise shall be reissued, and all such shares of such series shall be canceled and retired and
returned to shares of undesignated Preferred Stock which the Corporation shall be authorized to
issue subject to the terms herein.

ARTICLE V

A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or
otherwise for monetary damages for breach of any duty as a director, except for liability with
respect to (i) acts or omissions that the director at the time of such breach knew or believed were
clearly in conflict with the best interests of the Corporation, (ii) any liability under N.C. Gen.
Stat. § 55-8-33 for unlawful distributions or (iii) any transaction from which the director derived
an improper personal benefit. If the North Carolina Business Corporation Act is amended to
authorize corporate action for further eliminating or limiting personal liability of directors, then
the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent
permitted by the North Carolina Business Corporation Act, as so amended.

Any repeal or modification of the foregoing paragraph shall not adversely affect any right
or protection of a director of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification.

without prior notice if a consent(s) in writing, delivered to the Corporation for inclusion in the
minutes or filing in the corporate records, setting forth the action so taken and bearing the date of
signature(s), shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock, before or after such action,
having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take
the action at a meeting at which all shareholders entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.

or share exchange, (iii) a plan of conversion, (iv) the sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of
