when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors, out of any assets at the time legally available therefor, at the Dividend Rate specified for such
shares of Preferred Stock payable in preference and priority to any declaration or payment of any Distribution on Common Stock of the Corporation
in such calendar year. No Distributions shall be made with respect to the Common Stock until all declared dividends on the Preferred Stock have
been paid or set aside for payment to the Preferred Stock holders. Payment of any dividends to the holders of the Preferred Stock shall be on a pro
rata, pari passu basis in proportion to the Dividend Rates for each series of Preferred Stock. The right to receive dividends on shares of Preferred
Stock shall not be cumulative, and no right to such dividends shall accrue to holders of Preferred Stock by reason of the fact that dividends on said

dividends (other than dividends on Common Stock payable solely in Common Stock) declared or paid in any fiscal year shall be declared or paid

Stock which would be held by each such holder if all shares of Preferred Stock were converted at the then-effective Conversion Rate (as defined in
Section 4 hereof).

(c) Non-Cash Distributions. Whenever a Distribution provided for in this Section 2 shall be payable in property other than cash, the
value of such Distribution shall be deemed to be the fair market value of such property as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

6

3. Liquidation Rights.

(a) Liquidation Preference. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, either voluntary or
involuntary, the holders of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive out of the funds and assets legally available therefore, prior and in
preference to any Distribution of any of the assets of the Corporation to the holders of the Common Stock by reason of their ownership of such
stock, an amount per share for each share of Preferred Stock held by them equal to the sum of (i) the Liquidation Preference specified for such
share of Preferred Stock and (ii) all declared but unpaid dividends (if any) on such share of Preferred Stock. If upon the liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation, the assets of the Corporation legally available for distribution to the holders of the Preferred Stock are insufficient
to permit the payment to such holders of the full amounts specified in this Section 3(a), then the entire assets of the Corporation legally available
for distribution shall be distributed with equal priority and pro rata among the holders of the Preferred Stock in proportion to the full amounts they
would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 3(a).

(b) Remaining Assets. After the payment or setting aside for payment to the holders of Preferred Stock of the full amounts specified in
Section 3(a) above, the entire remaining assets of the Corporation legally available for distribution shall be distributed pro rata to holders of the
Common Stock of the Corporation in proportion to the number of shares of Common Stock held by them.

(c) Shares not Treated as Both Preferred Stock and Common Stock in any Distribution. Notwithstanding Sections 3(a) and 3(b) above,
solely for purposes of determining the amount that each holder of shares of Preferred Stock is entitled to receive with respect to a liquidation,

dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the holder of each share of each series of Preferred Stock shall be treated as if such holder had

http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1301501/0001193 12514091 160/d623715dex3 1.htm[4/25/2014 9:13:27 AM]
Prepared by R.R. Donnelley Financial -- EX-3.1

converted such holder’s shares of such series into shares of Common Stock immediately prior to such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation if, as a result of an actual conversion of any series of Preferred Stock (including taking into account the operation of this Section 3(c)
with respect to all series of Preferred Stock), each holder of such series would receive (with respect to the shares of such series), in the aggregate,
an amount greater than the amount that would be distributed to holders of such series (with respect to the shares of such series) if such holders had
not converted such series of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock. If holders of any series are treated as if they had converted shares of
Preferred Stock into Common Stock pursuant to this Section 3(c), then such holders shall not be entitled to receive any distribution pursuant to
Section 3(a) that would otherwise be made to holders of such series of Preferred Stock.

(d) Reorganization. For purposes of this Section 3, a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation shall be deemed to be
occasioned by, or to include, (a) the acquisition of the Corporation by another entity by means of any transaction or series of related transactions to
which the Corporation is party (including, without limitation, any stock acquisition, reorganization, merger or consolidation, but excluding any sale
of stock for capital raising purposes) other than a transaction or series of transactions in which the holders of the voting securities of the
Corporation outstanding immediately prior to such transaction continue to retain (either by such voting securities remaining outstanding or by such
voting securities

being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity), as a result of shares in the Corporation held by such holders prior to such
transaction, at least fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power represented by the voting securities of the Corporation or such surviving entity
outstanding immediately after such transaction or series of transactions; (b) a sale, lease, exclusive license or other conveyance of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Corporation; or (c) any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or
involuntary.

(e) Valuation of Non-Cash Consideration. If any assets of the Corporation distributed to stockholders in connection with any
liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation are other than cash, then the value of such assets shall be their fair market value as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, except that, unless otherwise provided for in the definitive agreements pertaining to any
Corporate Transaction, any publicly-traded securities to be distributed to stockholders in a liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the
Corporation shall be valued as follows:

(i) If the securities are then traded on a national securities exchange or The NASDAQ Stock Market (or a similar national
quotation system), then the value of the securities shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange or
system over the ten (10) trading day period ending five (5) trading days prior to the Distribution;

(ii) if the securities are actively traded over-the-counter, then the value of the securities shall be deemed to be the average of the
closing bid prices of the securities over the ten (10) trading day period ending five (5) trading days prior to the Distribution.

For the purposes of this Section 3(e), “trading day” shall mean any day which the exchange or system on which the securities to be
distributed are traded is open and “closing prices” or “closing bid prices” shall be deemed to be: (i) for securities traded primarily on the New
York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or The NASDAQ Stock Market, the last reported trade price or sale price, as the case may
be, at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on that day and (ii) for securities listed or traded on other exchanges, markets and systems, the market price as of
the end of the regular hours trading period that is generally accepted as such for such exchange, market or system. If, after the Filing Date, the
benchmark times generally accepted in the securities industry for determining the market price of a stock as of a given trading day shall change
from those set forth above, the fair market value shall be determined as of such other generally accepted benchmark times.

4. Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date
that is 180 days following the Filing Date, at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, into that number of fully-
paid, nonassessable shares of Common Stock determined by dividing the Original Issue Price for the relevant series by the Conversion Price for
such series (such number of shares of Common Stock into which each share of Preferred Stock of a series may be

8

converted is hereinafter referred to as the “Conversion Rate” for such series). Upon any decrease or increase in the Conversion Price for any series
of Preferred Stock, as described in this Section 4, the Conversion Rate for such series shall be appropriately increased or decreased.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into fully-paid, non-assessable shares of

Common Stock at the then effective Conversion Rate for such share (i) immediately prior to the closing of a firm commitment underwritten initial
public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), covering

http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1301501/0001193 12514091 160/d623715dex3 1.htm[4/25/2014 9:13:27 AM]
Prepared by R.R. Donnelley Financial -- EX-3.1

the offer and sale of the Corporation’s Common Stock, provided, however, that the fully diluted valuation of the Corporation is not less than
$200,000,000 and the aggregate gross proceeds to the Corporation (before deduction of underwriter’s commissions and expenses) are not less than
$40,000,000, or (11) upon the receipt by the Corporation of a written request for such conversion from the holders of a majority of the Preferred
Stock then outstanding on an as-converted-to-Common-Stock basis, or, if later, the effective date for conversion specified in such request (each of
the events referred to in (1) and (ii) are referred to herein as an “Automatic Conversion Event”).

(c) Special Mandatory Conversion.

(i) In the event that a holder of Preferred Stock (other than an Excluded Holder) as of 12:00 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time on
May 2, 2013 (a “First Closing Obligee”’) has not, prior to May 2, 2013, by itself or through one or more of its Affiliates (subject to
Section 4(c)(vii) below), purchased in the First Closing or a Supplemental Closing and, by execution of the Series D Purchase Agreement,
irrevocably committed to purchase in the Second Closing (taken together with the First Closing and any Supplemental Closings, the “Mandatory
Financing’), an aggregate amount in the Mandatory Financing at least equal to such holder’s Pro Rata Share, then the First Closing Conversion
Portion of each series of Preferred Stock (other than Series D Preferred Stock) held by such holder (a “First Closing Non-Participating
Investor”) shall automatically, and without further action on the part of such holder, be converted into Common Stock at ten (10) times the
applicable Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock. The amount of principal and interest of any Bridge Note converted by a holder into
Series D Preferred Stock at the First Closing shall be deemed to have been purchased by such holder for the purpose of the foregoing calculation.
Upon conversion pursuant to this Section 4(c)(i), the shares of Preferred Stock so converted shall be cancelled and not subject to reissuance.

(ii) In the event that a holder or an Eligible Transferee commits in the Series D Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement to purchase
Second Closing Shares in the Second Closing (a “Second Closing Obligee”’) but does not, by itself or through one or more of its Affiliates (subject
to Section 4(c)(vii) below), purchase at the Second Closing (if such occurs) at least the number of Second Closing Shares set forth opposite such
Second Closing Obligee’s name in the column titled “Shares of Series D Preferred Stock Committed to Purchase in Second Closing” on Exhibit A-
2 attached to the Series D Purchase Agreement, then (i) the Second Closing Conversion Portion of each series of Preferred Stock (other than Series
D Preferred Stock) held by such Second Closing Obligee (a “Second Closing Non-Participating Investor’) shall automatically, and without
further action on the part of such holder, be converted into Common Stock at ten (10) times the applicable Conversion Price of such series of
Preferred

Stock, and (ii) the Series D Conversion Portion of the Series D Preferred Stock held by such Second Closing Non-Participating Investor and
originally issued in the First Closing and any Supplemental Closing shall automatically, and without further action on the part of such holder, be
converted into Common Stock at ten (10) times the Conversion Price of the Series D Preferred Stock. Upon conversion pursuant to this

Section 4(c)(ii), the shares of Preferred Stock so converted shall be cancelled and not subject to reissuance. Shares of Preferred Stock that are held
by a Second Closing Obligee as of 11:59 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time on May 1, 2013, including any shares of Series D Preferred Stock purchased
by such Second Closing Obligee in the First Closing or any Supplemental Closing, will remain subject to conversion under this provision through
the date of the Second Closing, even if such shares are transferred to another holder prior to the Second Closing, and will be converted on the terms
provided in the forgoing sentence as if such shares of Preferred Stock were still held by such Second Closing Obligee.

(iii) For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding the Mandatory Conversions, the Conversion Prices of the shares of
Preferred Stock not converted pursuant to Sections 4(c)(i)-(ii) shall not be affected by the Mandatory Conversions.

(iv) The conversions that may occur pursuant to Sections 4(c)(i) shall be effective as of 12:00 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time on
May 2, 2013 and the conversions that may occur pursuant to Section 4(c)(ii) shall be effective immediately following the Second Closing, in each
case, whether or not the certificates evidencing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent, provided, however, that the
Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates or book entry shares evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such
conversions unless either the certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent, or the
holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory
to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates.

(v) On the date of the occurrence of any Mandatory Conversion, each holder whose shares are subject to conversion shall be
deemed to be the holder of record of the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, notwithstanding that the certificates representing such
shares of Preferred Stock shall not have been surrendered at the office of the Corporation, that notice from the Corporation shall not have been
received by any holder of record of shares of Preferred Stock, or that certificates or book entry shares evidencing such shares of Common Stock
shall not then be actually delivered to such holder.

(vi) In the event that (A) a holder of Preferred Stock converts any Preferred Stock into Common Stock pursuant to Section 4(a)
any time during the period beginning ninety (90) days prior to the First Closing Date and ending on the Second Closing Date (the shares of
Preferred Stock so converted, the “Early Converted Preferred’), and (B) the Early Converted Preferred would otherwise have been converted
pursuant to Sections 4(c)(i) or (ii) if such holder had not exercised its conversion rights under Section 4(a), such holder’s Preferred Stock

http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1301501/0001193 12514091 160/d623715dex3 1.htm[4/25/2014 9:13:27 AM]
Prepared by R.R. Donnelley Financial -- EX-3.1

(including its Early Converted Preferred) shall be deemed to have been converted to Common Stock at ten (10) times the applicable Conversion
Price of such series of Preferred Stock to the extent that such Preferred Stock would have been converted pursuant to Sections 4(c)(i) and (ii) had
such holder not exercised its conversion rights under Section 4(c).

10

(vii) The ability of one or more Affiliates to satisfy a holder’s Pro Rata Share for purposes of Section 4(c)(i) or Second Closing
obligation for purposes of Section 4(c)(ii) is conditioned on each such Affiliate’s own satisfaction in full of such Affiliate’s own Pro Rata Share or
Second Closing obligation, if any. No amounts invested by a holder or any Affiliate of a holder may be counted more than once so as to satisfy the
Pro Rata Share or Second Closing obligations of more than one holder.

(d) Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any
fractional shares to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the then fair
market value of a share of Common Stock as determined by the Board of Directors. For such purpose, all shares of Preferred Stock held by each
holder of Preferred Stock shall be aggregated, and any resulting fractional share of Common Stock shall be paid in cash. Before any holder of
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into full shares of Common Stock, and to receive certificates or book entry shares therefor,
such holder shall either (A) surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent
for the Preferred Stock or (B) notify the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and execute an
agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates, and shall
give written notice to the Corporation at such office that such holder elects to convert the same; provided, however, that on the date of an
Automatic Conversion Event, the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically without any further action by the holders
of such shares and whether or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent; provided further,
however, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates or book entry shares evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable
upon such Automatic Conversion Event unless either the certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are delivered to the Corporation or
its transfer agent as provided above, or the holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or
destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with
such certificates. On the date of the occurrence of an Automatic Conversion Event, each holder of record of shares of Preferred Stock shall be
deemed to be the holder of record of the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, notwithstanding that the certificates representing such
shares of Preferred Stock shall not have been surrendered at the office of the Corporation, that notice from the Corporation shall not have been
received by any holder of record of shares of Preferred Stock, or that certificates or book entry shares evidencing such shares of Common Stock
shall not then be actually delivered to such holder.

(e) Adjustments to Conversion Price for Diluting Issues.

(i) Special Definition. For purposes of this Section 4(e), “Additional Shares of Common” shall mean all shares of Common
Stock issued (or, pursuant to Section 4(e)(iii), deemed to be issued) by the Corporation after the Filing Date, other than issuances or deemed
issuances of:

(1) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable to officers, directors and employees of, or consultants to, the Corporation
pursuant to stock grants, option

11

plans, purchase plans or other employee stock incentive programs or arrangements approved by the Board of Directors, or upon exercise of options
or warrants granted to such parties pursuant to any such plan or arrangement;

(2) shares of Common Stock issued upon the exercise or conversion of Options or Convertible Securities outstanding as of

debt financing or commercial leasing transaction approved by the Board of Directors;

(7) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable in connection with any settlement of any action, suit, proceeding or
litigation approved by the Board of Directors;

(8) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable in connection with sponsored research, collaboration, technology license,
development, OEM, marketing or other similar agreements or strategic partnerships approved by the Board of Directors;

(9) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable to suppliers or third party service providers in connection with the
provision of goods or services pursuant to transactions approved by the Board of Directors; and

(10) any other shares of Common Stock issued or issuable if the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock agree in writing that such shares shall not constitute Additional Shares of Common Stock.

(ii) No Adjustment of Conversion Price. No adjustment in the Conversion Price of a particular series of Preferred Stock shall be
made in respect of the issuance of Additional Shares of Common unless the consideration per share (as determined pursuant to Section 4(e)(v)) for
an Additional Share of Common issued or deemed to be issued by the Corporation is less than the Conversion Price in effect on the date of, and
immediately prior to such issue, for the Series D Preferred Stock.

(iii) Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common. In the event the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the
Filing Date shall issue any Options or

12

Convertible Securities or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive any such Options or
Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of shares (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto without regard to any provisions
contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case of
Convertible Securities, the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities or, in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise
of such Options and the conversion or exchange of the underlying securities, shall be deemed to have been issued as of the time of such issue or, in
case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, provided that in any such case in which shares are
deemed to be issued:

(1) no further adjustment in the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock shall be made upon the subsequent issue
of Convertible Securities or shares of Common Stock in connection with the exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities;

(2) if such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any change
in the consideration payable to the Corporation or in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange
thereof (other than a change pursuant a Mandatory Conversion or the anti-dilution provisions of such Options or Convertible Securities such as this
Section 4(e) or pursuant to Recapitalization provisions of such Options or Convertible Securities such as Sections 4(f), 4(g) and 4(h) hereof), the
Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock and any subsequent adjustments based thereon shall be recomputed to reflect such change as if
such change had been in effect as of the original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of the record date with respect thereto);

(3) no readjustment pursuant to clause (2) above shall have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price of a series of
Preferred Stock to an amount above the Conversion Price that would have resulted from any other issuances of Additional Shares of Common and
any other adjustments provided for herein between the original adjustment date and such readjustment date;

(4) upon the expiration of any such Options or any rights of conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities
which shall not have been exercised, the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon the
occurrence of a record date with respect thereto) and any subsequent adjustments based thereon shall, upon such expiration, be recomputed as if:

(A) in the case of Convertible Securities or Options for Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common
issued were the shares of Common Stock, if any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities and the consideration received therefor was the consideration actually received by the Corporation for the issue of such
exercised Options plus the consideration actually received by the Corporation upon such exercise or for the issue of all such Convertible Securities
which were actually converted or exchanged, plus the additional consideration, if any, actually received by the Corporation upon such conversion
or exchange, and

Prepared by R.R. Donnelley Financial -- EX-3.1

(B) in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, only the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon
the exercise thereof were issued at the time of issue of such Options, and the consideration received by the Corporation for the Additional Shares of
Common deemed to have been then issued was the consideration actually received by the Corporation for the issue of such exercised Options, plus
the consideration deemed to have been received by the Corporation (determined pursuant to Section 4(e)(v)) upon the issue of the Convertible
Securities with respect to which such Options were actually exercised; and

(5) if such record date shall have been fixed and such Options or Convertible Securities are not issued on the date fixed
therefor, the adjustment previously made in the Conversion Price which became effective on such record date shall be canceled as of the close of
business on such record date, and thereafter the Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this Section 4(e)(iii) as of the actual date of their
issuance.

(iv) Adjustment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional Shares of Common

(1) Adjustment of Conversion Price of Series D Preferred Stock Upon Issuance of Additional Shares of Common.

(A) In the event this Corporation shall issue Additional Shares of Common (including Additional Shares of
Common deemed to be issued pursuant to Section 4(e)(iii)) after the Filing Date without consideration or for consideration per share less than the
then existing Conversion Price for the Series D Preferred Stock, then, the Conversion Price of the Series D Preferred Stock shall be reduced,
concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, (i) the
numerator of which shall be (A) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus (B) the number of shares
which the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of Common so issued would purchase at
such Conversion Price, and (ii) the denominator of which shall be (A) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
such issue plus (B) the number of such Additional Shares of Common so issued.

(B) Notwithstanding Section 4(e)(iv)(1)(A), if the Corporation shall at any time issue any Additional Shares of
Common (including Additional Shares of Common deemed to be issued pursuant to Section 4(e)(iii)) in a Subsequent Closing under the Series D
Purchase Agreement for consideration per share (such price, the “Subsequent Closing Price”) less than the then existing Conversion Price of the
Series D Preferred Stock, then, in lieu of the adjustments provided for in Section 4(e)(iv)(1)(A), the Conversion Price of the Series D Preferred
Stock shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue to the Subsequent Closing Price.

14

(2) Adjustments to the Conversion Price of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred

(A) In the event this Corporation shall issue Additional Shares of Common (including Additional Shares of
Common deemed to be issued pursuant to Section 4(e)(iii)) after the Filing Date without consideration or for consideration per share less than the
then existing Conversion Price for the Series C Preferred Stock (a “Dilutive Issuance”), then, the Conversion Price of the Series C Preferred Stock
shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a
fraction, (i) the numerator of which shall be (A) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus (B) the
number of shares which the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of Common so issued
would purchase at such Conversion Price, and (ii) the denominator of which shall be (A) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to such issue plus (B) the number of such Additional Shares of Common so issued. Immediately after the Conversion Price for
the Series C Preferred Stock has been adjusted as a result of each Dilutive Issuance pursuant to this Section 4(e)(iv)(2)(A), the Conversion Prices
for the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock shall each respectively be adjusted to a price equal to the then-effective Conversion
Price for the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, as applicable, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the
Conversion Price for the Series C Preferred Stock immediately following the adjustment set forth in this Section 4(e)(iv) for the Dilutive Issuance
and the denominator of which shall be the Conversion Price of the Series C Preferred Stock immediately prior to the adjustment set forth in this
Section 4(e)(iv) for the Dilutive Issuance. For purposes of illustration only, if the Conversion Price for the Series C Preferred Stock after a Dilutive
Issuance is adjusted to $0.8175, from the initial Conversion Price of the Series C Preferred Stock of $1.09, then the Conversion Prices for the Series
A Preferred Stock and the Conversion Price for the Series B Preferred Stock would be adjusted to $0.91239 and $1.0656225, respectively, in
connection with such Dilutive Issuance, representing an adjustment factor of 0.75 from the current Conversion Price of each such series.

(B) Notwithstanding Section 4(e)(iv)(2)(A), in the event of a Subsequent Closing as a result of which the Conversion
Price of the Series D Preferred Stock is adjusted pursuant to Section 4(e)(iv)(1)(B) (a “Subsequent Closing Adjustment’), the Conversion Price
of the Series C Preferred Stock shall be reduced, concurrently with such Subsequent Closing Adjustment, to a price (calculated to the nearest cent)
determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which shall be (A) the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such Subsequent Closing plus (B) the number of shares which the aggregate consideration received by the
Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of Common issued in such Subsequent Closing would purchase at such Conversion Price,
and (ii) the denominator of which shall be (A) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Subsequent Closing

http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1301501/0001193 12514091 160/d623715dex3 1.htm[4/25/2014 9:13:27 AM]
Prepared by R.R. Donnelley Financial -- EX-3.1

plus (B) the number of such Additional Shares of Common issued in such Subsequent Closing, plus (C) the Series D Adjustment Additional Shares
with respect to such Subsequent Closing Adjustment. The “Series D Adjustment Additional Shares” with respect to a Subsequent Closing
Adjustment shall be equal to the product of (i) the aggregate number of shares of Series D Preferred Stock issued in the First Closing, any
Supplemental Closings and the Second Closing (if such has occurred) that are outstanding at the time of the Subsequent Closing and (ii) the

15

result of (a) the Conversion Rate applicable to the Series D Preferred Stock immediately following such Subsequent Closing Adjustment, minus
(b) the Conversion Rate applicable to the Series D Preferred Stock immediately prior to such Subsequent Closing Adjustment. Immediately after
the Conversion Price for the Series C Preferred Stock has been adjusted as a result of a Subsequent Closing Adjustment pursuant to this

Section 4(e)(iv)(2)(B), the Conversion Prices for the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock shall each respectively be adjusted to a
price equal to the then-effective Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, as applicable, multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Conversion Price for the Series C Preferred Stock immediately following the adjustment set forth in
this Section 4(e)(iv)(2)(B) and the denominator of which shall be the Conversion Price of the Series C Preferred Stock immediately prior to the
adjustment set forth in this Section 4(e)(iv)(2)(B). The adjustments provided by this Section 4(e)(iv)(2)(B) shall be in lieu of any adjustments that
would be provided by Section 4(e)(iv)(2)(A) with respect to such Subsequent Closing.

(3) Notwithstanding Sections 4(e)(iv)(1)-(2), the Conversion Price shall not be reduced at such time if the amount of such
reduction would be less than $0.01, but any such amount shall be carried forward, and a reduction will be made with respect to such amount at the
time of, and together with, any subsequent reduction which, together with such amount and any other amounts so carried forward, equal $0.01 or
more in the aggregate. For the purposes of this Section 4(e)(iv)(3), all shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all outstanding shares
of Preferred Stock and the exercise and/or conversion of any other outstanding Convertible Securities and all outstanding Options shall be deemed
to be outstanding.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this Section 4(e), the consideration received by the Corporation for the
issue (or deemed issue) of any Additional Shares of Common shall be computed as follows:

(1) Cash and Property. Such consideration shall:

(A) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the aggregate amount of cash received by the Corporation before
deducting any reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the Corporation for any underwriting or otherwise
in connection with such issuance;

(B) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be computed at the fair market value thereof at the time of
such issue, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors; and

(C) in the event Additional Shares of Common are issued together with other shares or securities or other assets of
the Corporation for consideration which covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in clauses (a) and
(b) above, as reasonably determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

16

(2) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of
Common deemed to have been issued pursuant to Section 4(e)(iii) shall be determined by dividing

(x) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Corporation as consideration for the issue of such Options or
Convertible Securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without
regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration) payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such
Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such
Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities by

(y) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any
provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange
of such Convertible Securities.

(f) Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of Common Stock. In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be
subdivided (by stock split, by payment of a stock dividend or otherwise) after the Filing Date into a greater number of shares of Common Stock,
the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of
such subdivision, be proportionately decreased. Except for the Reverse Stock Split, in the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be

http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1301501/0001193 12514091 160/d623715dex3 1.htm[4/25/2014 9:13:27 AM]
Prepared by R.R. Donnelley Financial -- EX-3.1

combined (by reclassification or otherwise) after the Filing Date into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Prices in effect
immediately prior to such combination shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination, be proportionately increased.

(g) Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of Preferred Stock. In the event the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock or a series
of Preferred Stock shall be subdivided (by stock split, by payment of a stock dividend or otherwise) after the Filing Date into a greater number of
shares of Preferred Stock, the Dividend Rate, Original Issue Price and Liquidation Preference of the affected series of Preferred Stock in effect
immediately prior to such subdivision shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such subdivision, be proportionately decreased. Except for the
Reverse Stock Split, in the event the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock or a series of Preferred Stock shall be combined (by reclassification or
otherwise) after the Filing Date into a lesser number of shares of Preferred Stock, the Dividend Rate, Original Issue Price and Liquidation
Preference of the affected series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such combination shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of
such combination, be proportionately increased.

(h) Adjustments for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. Subject to Section 3 above, and except for the Reverse Stock Split, if
the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be changed after the Filing Date into the same or a different number of
shares of any other class or classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or
combination of shares

17

provided for above), then, in any such event, in lieu of the number of shares of Common Stock which the holders would otherwise have been
entitled to receive each holder of such Preferred Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such shares of Preferred Stock into a number of
shares of such other class or classes of stock which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of such series
of Preferred Stock immediately before that change would have been entitled to receive in such reorganization or reclassification, all subject to
further adjustment as provided herein with respect to such other shares.

(i) No Impairment. The Corporation will not through any reorganization, transfer of assets, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of
securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed
hereunder by the Corporation but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Section 4 and in the taking of
all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the Conversion Rights of the holders of Preferred Stock against impairment.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 4(i) shall prohibit the Corporation from amending its Certificate of Incorporation with the
requisite consent of its stockholders and the board of directors.

(j) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this
Section 4, the Corporation at its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish
to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such
adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause
to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (1) such adjustments and readjustments, (2) the Conversion Price at the time in effect
and (3) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon the conversion
of Preferred Stock.

(k) Waiver of Adjustment of Conversion Price. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any downward adjustment of the
Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock may be waived by the consent or vote of the holders of the majority of the outstanding shares of
such series either before or after the issuance causing the adjustment.

(1) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized
but unissued shares of Common Stock solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock, such number of its
shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and
if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding
shares of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.

18

(c) Preferred Stock. Each holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of shares of Common
Stock into which the shares of Preferred Stock held by such holder could be converted as of the record date. The holders of shares of the Preferred
Stock shall be entitled to vote on all matters on which the Common Stock shall be entitled to vote. Holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
notice of any stockholders’ meeting in accordance with the Bylaws of the Corporation. Fractional votes shall not, however, be permitted and any
fractional voting rights resulting from the above formula (after aggregating all shares into which shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder
could be converted), shall be disregarded.

(d) Election of Directors. The holders representing a majority of the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class,
shall be entitled to elect two (2) members of the Corporation’s Board of Directors at each meeting or pursuant to each consent of the Corporation’s
stockholders for the election of directors. The holders of representing a majority of the outstanding Series B Preferred Stock , voting as a separate
class, shall be entitled to elect one (1) member of the Corporation’s Board of Directors at each meeting or pursuant to each consent of the
Corporation’s stockholders for the election of directors. The holders of representing a majority of the outstanding Series C Preferred Stock, voting

Stock, voting together as a single class. If a vacancy on the Board of Directors is to be filled by the Board of Directors, only directors elected by the
same class or classes of stockholders as those who would be entitled to vote to fill such vacancy shall vote to fill such vacancy.

(e) Adjustment in Authorized Common Stock. The number of authorized shares of Common Stock may be increased or decreased (but
not below the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding) by an affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock of the
Corporation.

19

of the California General Corporation Law applicable to the Corporation, the Corporation’s stockholders shall have the right to cumulate their
votes in connection with the election of directors as provided by Section 708 subdivisions (a), (b) and (c) of the California General Corporation
Law.

6. Protective Provisions.

(a) Preferred Stock. For so long as at least 136,363 shares (as adjusted for Recapitalizations that occur after the Filing Date, except
with respect to the Reverse Stock Split) of the Preferred Stock shall be issued and outstanding, the Corporation shall not, without first obtaining the

a manner that adversely affects such series of Preferred Stock shall require the approval (by vote or written consent as provided by law) of at least a
majority of the outstanding shares of such series of Preferred Stock voting as a separate class; provided further, however, that authorization or
creation of any new class or series of shares having powers, preferences, or privileges senior to or on parity with any series of Preferred Stock then
outstanding shall not be deemed an action adverse to such series of Preferred Stock;

(b) Series D Preferred Stock. For so long as at least 909,090 shares (as adjusted for Recapitalizations that occur after the Filing Date,
except with respect to the Reverse Stock Split) of Series D Preferred Stock shall be issued and outstanding, the Corporation shall not, without first
