2.5 Conversion.
(a) Conversion Procedure.

(i) Any holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock may convert all or any portion of the shares of Series
A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock (including any fraction
of a share) held by such holder into a number of shares of Common Stock computed by
multiplying the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series
C Preferred Stock, as the case may be, to be converted by the applicable Original Issue Price, and
dividing the result by the applicable Conversion Price (as defined below) then in effect.

(ii) Each conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock,
Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have been effected as of
the close of business on the date on which the certificate or certificates representing the shares of
Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock, as the case may
be, to be converted, together with properly executed conversion instructions or stock powers,
have been surrendered for conversion at the principal office of the Corporation. At the time such
conversion has been effected, the rights of the holder with respect to the converted shares of
Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock, as the case may
be, shall cease and the Person or Persons in whose name or names any certificate or certificates
for shares of Common Stock are to be issued upon such conversion shall be deemed to have
become the holder or holders of record of the shares of Common Stock represented by such
certificate or certificates.

3894548 1.DOC -I1-
(iii) As soon as possible after a conversion has been effected
(but in any event within three business days), the Corporation shall deliver to the converting
holder:

1. a certificate or certificates representing the number
of shares of Common Stock issuable by reason of such conversion in such name or names and
such denomination or denominations as the converting holder has specified:

2. a certificate representing any shares of Series A
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock, as the case may be, which
were represented by the certificate or certificates delivered to the Corporation in connection with
such conversion but which were not converted; and

3. cash in lieu of any fractional share as provided in
Section 2.5(a)(v) of this Article Four.

(iv) The issuance of certificates for shares of Common Stock
upon conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series C
Preferred Stock shall be made without charge to the holders of such shares of Series A Preferred
Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock, as the case may be, for any issuance
tax in respect of such issuance or other cost incurred by the Corporation in connection with such
conversion and the related issuance of shares of Common Stock, other than any transfer taxes
resulting from the transfer of converted shares to a Person or Persons other than the converting
holder. Upon conversion of each share of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or
Series C Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall take all such actions as are necessary in order to
insure that the Common Stock issuable with respect to such conversion shall be validly issued,
fully paid, and nonassessable.

(v) If any fractional interest in a share of Common Stock
would, except for the provisions of this Section 2.5(a)(v), be deliverable upon any conversion of
shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock, the
Corporation, in lieu of delivering such fractional share of Common Stock, shall pay an amount to
the holder of such fractional interest equal to the Fair Market Value of such fractional interest as
of the date of conversion. All shares of Common Stock issuable to a holder shall be aggregated
for purposes of determining whether a fractional interest shall result from any conversion.

(vi) All declared but unpaid dividends on shares of Series A
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock, as the case may be, to be
converted shall be payable upon conversion of such shares in cash or, at the option of a majority
of the Board, in shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value as of the date of
conversion equal to the amount of such declared but unpaid dividends.

(b) Conversion Price.
(i) The “Series A Conversion Price” shall initially be the
Series A Original Issue Price per share of Series A Preferred Stock. The “Series B Conversion

Price” shall initially be the Series B Original Issue Price per share of Series B Preferred Stock.
The “Series C Conversion Price” shall initially be the Series C Original Issue Price per share of

3894548_1.D0C -12-
Series C Preferred Stock. The Series A Conversion Price, the Series B Conversion Price and the
Series C Conversion Price are each referred to herein as a “Conversion Price.” In order to
prevent dilution of the conversion nights granted under this subdivision, each Conversion Price
also shall be subject to adjustment from time to time pursuant to Section 2.5(b)(ii) of Article
Four.

(ii) ‘If and whenever, on or after the date of this Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Corporation issues or sells, or is deemed to have issued
or sold, any shares of its Common Stock for consideration per share less than (A) in the case of
the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, the Series B Conversion Price in
effect immediately prior to the time of such issue or sale or (B) in the case of the Series C
Preferred Stock, the Series C Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the time of such
issue or sale, then immediately upon such issue or sale, the Series A Conversion Price, Series B
Conversion Price or the Series C Conversion Price, as the case may be, shall be reduced to the
price determined by multiplying such Conversion Pnce by a fraction:

1. the numerator of which shall be (x) the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale (assuming the
exercise or conversion of all Options (as defined below) and Convertible Securities (as defined
below) that are then exercisable or convertible, and assuming (without duplication) the issuance
of all shares reserved for issuance pursuart to any Approved Plan), plus (y) the number of shares
of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for the total
number of additional shares of Common Stock so issued or sold would purchase at such
Conversion Price; and

2. the denominator of which shall be the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale (assuming the
exercise or conversion of all Options and Convertible Securities that are then exercisable or
convertible, and assuming (without duplication) the issuance of all shares reserved for issuance
pursuant to any Approved Plan) plus the number of additional shares of Common Stock so
issued.

(iii) | Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation shall not be
required to make any adjustment to the Conversion Price by reason of the issuance of Common
Stock when such issuance is (i) upon conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, (ii) upon
conversion of shares of Series B Preferred Stock, (iii) upon conversion of shares of Series C
Preferred Stock, (iv) as a dividend or distribution on the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock, (v) pursuant to any Approved Plan, (vi) in
connection with an acquisition transaction, building or equipment lease transaction, bank loan
transaction, or strategic alliance or partnering arrangement that is not primarily for equity
financing purposes and that is approved by the Board (including at least one Purchaser Director),
(vii) pursuant to a Purchase Agreement, or (viii) pursuant to warrants to purchase up to 368
shares of Common Stock or 64,528 shares of Series C Preferred Stock outstanding as of the date
of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

3893558_1.DOC -13-
(c) Effect_on Conversion Price of Certain Events. For purposes of
determining the adjusted Conversion Price under Section 2.5 of this Article Four, the following
shall be applicable:

(i) If the Corporation in any manner issues or grants any
options, warrants, or similar nights (“Options”) to purchase or acquire Common Stock or Equity
Securities convertible or exchangeable, with or without consideration, into or for Common Stock
(“Convertible Securities”) and the price per share for which Common Stock is issuable upon
the exercise of such Options or upon conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities is
less than the Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to the
time of the granting of such Options, then the total maximum number of shares of Common
Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Options or upon conversion or exchange of the total
maximum amount of such Convertible Securities issuable upon the exercise of such Options
shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the Corporation for such
price per share. For purposes of this Section, the “price per share for which Common Stock is
issuable” shall be determined by dividing (a) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by
the Corporation as consideration for the granting of such Options, plus the minimum aggregate
amount of additional consideration payable to the Corporation upon exercise of all such Options,
plus, in the case of such Options which relate to Convertible Securities, the minimum aggregate
amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to the Corporation upon the issuance or sale
of such Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, by
(b) the total maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such
Options or upon the conversion or exchange of all such Convertible Securities issuable upon the
exercise of such Options. No further adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made when
Convertible Securities are actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or when Common
Stock is actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities.

(ii) If the Corporation in any manner issues or sells any
Convertible Securities and the price per share for which Common Stock is issuable upon such
conversion or exchange is less than the Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock in
effect immediately prior to the time of such issue or sale, then the maximum number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities shall be
deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the Corporation for such price per
share. For the purposes of this Section, the “price per share for which Common Stock is
issuable” shall be determined by dividing (a) the total amount received or receivable by the
Corporation as consideration for the issue or sale of such Convertible Securities, plus the
minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to the Corporation upon
the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, by (b) the total maximum number of
shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion or exchange of all such Convertible
Securities. No further adjustment of the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock shall
be made when Common Stock is actually issued upon the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities, and if any such issue or sale of such Convertible Securities is made upon
exercise of any Options for which adjustments of the Conversion Price for such series of
Preferred Stock had been or are to be made pursuant to other provisions of this Section 2.5 of
Article Four, no further adjustment of the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock
shall be made by reason of such issue or sale.

3894548_1.DOC -14-
(ii) If the purchase price provided for in any Options, the
additional consideration, if any, payable upon the conversion or exchange of any Convertible
Securities or the rate at which any Convertible Securities are convertible into or exchangeable for
Common Stock changes at any time, the Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock in
effect at the time of such change shall be readjusted to the Conversion Price for such series of
Preferred Stock which would have been in effect at such time had such Options or Convertible
Securities stil] outstanding provided for such changed purchase price, additional consideration,
or changed conversion rate, as the case may be, at the time initially granted, issued, or sold.

(iv) Upon the expiration of any Option or the termination of any
right to convert or exchange any Convertible Security without the exercise of any such Option or
right, the Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock then in effect under this Certificate
shall be adjusted to the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock which would have
been in effect at the time of such expiration or termination had such Option or Convertible
Security, to the extent outstanding immediately prior to such expiration or termination, never
been issued.

(v) If any Common Stock, Option, or Convertible Security is
issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold for cash, the consideration received for such
Common Stock, Option, or Convertible Security shall be deemed to be the net amount received
by the Corporation for such Common Stock, Option, or Convertible Security. In case any
Common Stock, Options, or Convertible Securities are issued or sold for a consideration other
than cash, the amount of the consideration other than cash received by the Corporation shall be
the Fair Market Value of such Common Stock, Options, or Convertible Securities as of the date
of receipt. If any Common Stock, Option, or Convertible Security is issued in connection with
any merger in which the Corporation is the surviving corporation, the amount of consideration
for such Common Stock, Option, or Convertible Security shall be deemed to be the Fair Market
Value of such portion of the net assets and business of the non-surviving corporation as is
attributable to such Common Stock, Options, or Convertible Securities, as the case may be.

(vi) In case any Option is issued in connection with the issue or
sale of other securities of the Corporation, together comprising one integrated transaction in
which no specific consideration is allocated to such Option by the parties to such transaction, the
Option shall be deemed to have been issued for a consideration of $0.001.

(vil) The number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any
given time does not include shares owned or held by or for the account of the Corporation or any
Subsidiary, and the disposition of any shares so owned or held shall be considered an issue or
sale of Common Stock.

(viii) If the Corporation takes a record of the holders of Common
Stock for the purpose of entitling them (a) to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in
Common Stock, Options, or Convertible Securities or (b) to subscribe for or purchase Common
Stock, Options, or Convertible Securities, then such record date shall be deemed to be the date of
the issue or sale of the shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued or sold upon the
declaration of such dividend or upon the making of such other distribution or the date of the
granting of such right of subscription or purchase, as the case may be.

3894548_1.D0C -15-
(d) Subdivision or Combination of Common Stock. If the Corporation
at any time subdivides (by any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, or otherwise after the
filing date of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation) its outstanding shares of
Common Stock into a greater number of shares, the Conversion Price for each series of Preferred
Stock in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall be proportionately reduced, and if the
Corporation at any time combines (by reverse stock split or otherwise after the filing date of this
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation) its outstanding shares of Common Stock
into a smaller number of shares, the Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock in effect
immediately prior to such combination shall be proportionately increased.

(e) Reorganization, Mergers, Consolidations, or Sales_of Assets.
Subject to Section 2.2(c) of this Article Four, if at any time or from time to time there shall be a
capital reorganization of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision, combination,
reclassification, or exchange of shares provided for elsewhere in this Section 2.5 of Article Four)
or a merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into another corporation, or the sale of al]
or substantially all of the Corporation’s properties and assets to any other person, then, as a part
of such reorganization, merger, consolidation, or sale, provision shall be made so that the holders
of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock, after
such reorganization, merger, consolidation, or sale, shall be entitled to receive upon conversion
of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock, the
number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the Corporation (including cash), or
of the successor corporation resulting from such merger or consolidation or sale, to which a
holder of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled on such capital
reorganization, merger, consolidation, or sale. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be
made in the application of the provisions of this Section 2.5 of Article Four with respect to the
rights of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C
Preferred Stock after the reorganization, merger, consolidation, or sale to the effect that the
provisions of this Section 2.5 of Article Four (including adjustment of each Conversion Price and
the number of shares purchasable upon conversion of Series A Preferred Stock, Senes B
Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event as nearly
equivalent as may be practicable.

(f) Certain Events; No Impairment. If any event occurs of the type
contemplated by the provisions of this Section 2.5 of Article Four but not expressly provided for
by such provisions, then the Board shall make an appropriate adjustment in each Conversion
Price so as to protect the rights of the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock; provided that no such adjustment shall increase
any Conversion Price as otherwise determined pursuant to this Section 2.5 of Article Four or
decrease the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of each share of
Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock. The Corporation
shall not avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed
or performed under this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation by the Corporation
but shall at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Section
2.5 of Article Four and in the taking of all actions that may be necessary or appropriate to protect
the nghts of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C
Preferred Stock against impairment.

3894548_1.DOC -16-
(g) Notices.

(i) Immediately upon any adjustment of a Conversion Price,
the Corporation shall give written notice of such adjustment to all holders of shares of Series A
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock, as the case may be.

(ii) | The Corporation shall give written notice to all holders of
shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Senes C Preferred Stock at least
10 days prior to the date on which the Corporation closes its books or takes a record (a) with

(h) Automatic Conversion. All of the outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock shall be converted into
Common Stock at the applicable Conversion Price then in effect without any further action on
the part of the Corporation or any holder of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or
Series C Preferred Stock, upon the earlier of (i) immediately prior to the time of and subject to
the closing and funding of a Qualified Public Offering or (ii) the date that a cumulative total of at
least seventy-five percent (75%) of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred
Stock and Series C Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class, on an as-converted basis)
issued by the Corporation prior to such date (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends,
recapitalizations, combinations, and similar transactions with respect to such shares after the
filing date of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation) have been converted into
Common Stock pursuant to this Section 2.5 of Article Four or otherwise consent thereto.

(i) Other Distributions. In the event that the Corporation at any time
or from time to time after the date of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation the
Corporation declares a distribution payable in securities of other Persons, evidences of
indebtedness issued by the Corporation or other Persons, or assets of the Corporation (excluding
cash dividends), then in each such case for the purpose of this Section 2.5(i) of Article Four, the
holders of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any such distribution
as though they were the holders of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation
into which their shares of Preferred Stock are convertible as of the record date fixed for the
determination of the holders of Common Stock of the Corporation entitled to receive such
distribution.

(j) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation
shall at al] times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common

Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of Preferred Stock, such
number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, and if at any time the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, in addition to such other remedies as shall be
available to the holder of such Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series C
Preferred Stock, as the case may be, the Corporation shall take such corporate action as may be
necessary, in the reasonable opinion of its counsel, to increase its authorized but unissued shares

3894548_1.DOC -17-
of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including,
without limitation, using its best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any
necessary amendment to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. The
Corporation shall also use its best efforts to take all such actions as may be necessary to ensure
that all shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock may be so
issued without violation of any applicable law or governmental regulation or any requirements of
any securities exchange or quotation system upon which shares of Common Stock may be listed
or quoted, as the case may be.

(k) Waiver _of Adjustment_to Conversion Price. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, any downward adjustment of the Conversion Price of any series

of Preferred Stock may be waived, either prospectively or retroactively or in a particular
instance, by the consent or vote of the holders of at least 66-2/3% of the outstanding shares of
such series of Preferred Stock. Any such waiver shall bind all future holders of shares of such
series of Preferred Stock.

office a register for the registration of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred
Stock and Series C Preferred Stock. Upon the surrender of any certificate representing shares of

the Corporation's expense) a new certificate or certificates in exchange for such surrendered
certificate representing in the aggregate the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series
B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock, as the case may be, represented by the
surrendered certificate. Each such new certificate shall be registered in such name and shall
represent such number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series
C Preferred Stock, as the case may be, as is requested by the holder of the surrendered certificate
and shall be substantially identical in form to the surrendered certificate, and dividends shall
accrue on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred
Stock, as the case may be, represented by such new certificate from the date to which dividends
have been fully paid on such shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or
Series C Preferred Stock, as the case may be, represented by the surrendered certificate.

2.7 Replacement. Upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the
Corporation (an affidavit without bond of the registered holder shall be satisfactory) of the
ownership and the loss, theft, destruction, or mutilation of any certificate evidencing shares of
Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock and, in the case of
any such loss, theft, or destruction, upon receipt of indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the

representing the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series
C Preferred Stock, as the case may be, represented by such lost, stolen, destroyed, or mutilated
certificate, and dividends shall accrue on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock, as the case may be, represented by such new
