as “Series C Preferred Stock.”

B. Rights, Preferences and Restrictions of Preferred Stock. The rights,
preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to and imposed on the Preferred Stock are as set
forth below in this Article IV(B).

1. Dividend Provisions.

(a) The holders of shares of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
receive dividends, on a pari passu basis, out of any assets legally available therefor, prior and in
preference to any declaration or payment of any dividend (payable other than in Common Stock
or other securities and rights convertible into or entitling the holder thereof to receive, directly or
indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock of this corporation) on the Common Stock of this
corporation, at the applicable Dividend Rate (as defined below), payable when, as and if declared
by the Board of Directors. Such dividends shall not be cumulative. The holders of the
outstanding Preferred Stock can waive any dividend preference that such holders shall be entitled
to receive under this Section 1 upon the affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of at
least a majority of the shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding (voting together as a single
class and not as separate series, and on an as-converted basis). For purposes of this
subsection 1(a), “Dividend Rate” shall mean $0.022 per annum for each share of Series A
Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, subdivisions,
recapitalizations or the like), $0.0272 per annum for each share of Series A-2 Preferred Stock (as
adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, subdivisions, recapitalizations or the
like), $0.065 per annum for each share of Series B Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any stock
splits, stock dividends, combinations, subdivisions, recapitalizations or the like) and $.2676848
per annum for each share of Series C Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock
dividends, combinations, subdivisions, recapitalizations or the like).

(b) After payment of such dividends, any additional dividends
or distributions shall be distributed among all holders of Common Stock and Preferred Stock in
proportion to the number of shares of Common Stock that would be held by each such holder if
all shares of Preferred Stock were converted to Common Stock at the then effective conversion
rate.

2. Liquidation Preference.

(a) In the event of any Liquidation Event (as defined below),
either voluntary or involuntary, the holders of each series of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
receive, prior and in preference to any distribution of the proceeds of such Liquidation Event (the
Proceeds”) to the holders of Comrnon Stock by reason of their ownership thereof and pari passu

GDSVF&H\ 2
to each other, an amount per share equal to the sum of the applicable Original Issue Price (as
defined below) for such series of Preferred Stock, plus declared but unpaid dividends on such
share. If, upon the occurrence of such event, the Proceeds thus distributed among the holders of
the Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full
aforesaid preferential amounts, then the entire Proceeds legally available for distribution shall be
distributed ratably among the holders of the Preferred Stock in proportion to the full preferential
amount that each such holder is otherwise entitled to receive under this subsection (a). For
purposes of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation, “Original Issue Price” shall mean $0.275
per share for each share of the Series A Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock
dividends, combinations, subdivisions, recapitalizations or the like with respect to such series of
Preferred Stock), $0.34 per share for each share of the Series A-2 Preferred Stock (as adjusted
for any stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, subdivisions, recapitalizations or the like
with respect to such series of Preferred Stock), $0.825 per share for each share of the Series B
Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, subdivisions,
recapitalizations or the like with respect to such series of Preferred Stock) and $3.34606 per
share for each share of the Series C Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock
dividends, combinations, subdivisions, recapitalizations or the like with respect to such series of
Preferred Stock).

(b) Upon completion of the distribution required by
subsection (a) of this Section 2, all of the remaining Proceeds available for distribution to
stockholders shall be distributed among the holders of Common Stock pro rata based on the
number of shares of Common Stock held by each.

(c) | Notwithstanding the above, for purposes of determining the
amount each holder of shares of Preferred Stock is entitled to receive with respect to a
Liquidation Event, each such holder of shares of a series of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to
have converted (regardless of whether such holder actually converted) such holder’s shares of
such series into shares of Common Stock immediately prior to the Liquidation Event if} as a
result of an actual conversion, such holder would receive, in the aggregate, an amount greater
than the amount that would be distributed to such holder if such holder did not convert such
series of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock. If any such holder shall be deemed to
have converted shares of Preferred Stock into Common Stock pursuant to this paragraph, then
such holder shall not be entitled to receive any distribution that would otherwise be made to
holders of such shares of Preferred Stock.

(d) (i) For purposes of this Section 2, a “Liquidation
Event” shall include (A) the closing of the sale, transfer or other disposition of all or
substantially all of this corporation’s assets, (B)the consummation of the merger or
consolidation of this corporation with or into another entity (except a merger or consolidation in
which the holders of capital stock of this corporation immediately prior to such merger or
consolidation continue to hold at least 50% of the voting power of the capital stock of this
corporation or the surviving or acquiring entity), (C) the closing of the transfer (whether by
merger, consolidation or otherwise), in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to a
person or group of persons (other than an underwriter of this corporation’s securities), of this
corporation’s securities if, after such closing, such person or group of persons would hold 50%
or more of the outstanding voting stock of this corporation (or the surviving or acquiring entity)

GDSVF&H\ 3
or (D) a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of this corporation; provided, however, that a
transaction shall not constitute a Liquidation Event if its sole purpose is to change the state of
this corporation’s incorporation or to create a holding company that will be owned in
substantially the same proportions by the persons who held this corporation’s securities
immediately prior to such transaction. Notwithstanding the prior sentence, the sale of shares of
Series C Preferred Stock in a financing transaction shall not be deemed a “Liquidation Event.”
The treatment of any particular transaction or series of related transactions as a Liquidation
Event may be waived by the vote or written consent of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class and not as separate series, and on
an as-converted basis).

(ii) In any Liquidation Event, if Proceeds received by
this corporation or its stockholders is other than cash, its value will be deemed its fair market
value. Any securities shall be valued as follows:

(A) Securities not subject to investment letter or
other similar restrictions on free marketability covered by (B) below:

(1) If traded on a securities exchange or
through the Nasdaq National Market, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing
prices of the securities on such exchange or system over the twenty (20) trading-day period
ending three (3) trading days prior to the closing of the Liquidation Event;

(2) If actively traded over-the-counter,
the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is
applicable) over the twenty (20) trading-day period ending three (3) trading days prior to the
closing of the Liquidation Event; and

(3) If there is no active public market,
the value shall be the fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by this corporation and
the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of Preferred
Stock.

(B) The method of valuation of securities
subject to investment letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions
arising solely by virtue of a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to
make an appropriate discount from the market value determined as above in (A) (1), (2) or (3) to
reflect the approximate fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by this corporation and
the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of such
Preferred Stock.

(C) The foregoing methods for valuing non-cash
consideration to be distributed in connection with a Liquidation Event may be superseded by any
determination of such value set forth in the definitive agreements governing such Liquidation:
Event.

* (iii) In the event the requirements of this Section 2 are
not complied with, this corporation shall forthwith either:

GDSVF&H\ 4
(A) cause the closing of such Liquidation Event
to be postponed until such time as the requirements of this Section 2 have been complied with; or

(B) cancel such transaction, in which event the
rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of the Preferred Stock shall revert to and be the
same as such rights, preferences and privileges existing immediately prior to the date of the first
notice referred to in subsection 2(d)(iv) hereof.

(iv) | This corporation shall give each holder of record of
Preferred Stock written or electronic notice of such impending Liquidation Event not later than
twenty (20) days prior to the stockholders’ meeting called to approve such transaction, or twenty
(20) days prior to the closing of such transaction, whichever is earlier, and shall also notify such
holders in writing of the final approval of such transaction. The first of such notices shall
describe the material terms and conditions of the impending transaction and the provisions of this
Section 2, and this corporation shall thereafter give such holders prompt notice of any material
changes. The transaction shall in no event take place sooner than twenty (20) days after this
corporation has given the first notice provided for herein or sooner than ten (10) days after this
corporation has given notice of any material changes provided for herein; provided, however,
that subject to compliance with the General Corporation Law such periods may be shortened or
waived upon the written consent of the holders of Preferred Stock that represent at least a
majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of such Preferred Stock (voting
together as a single class and not as separate series, and on an as-converted basis).

3. Redemption. The Preferred Stock is not redeemable.

4. Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have
conversion rights as follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be
convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such
share, at the office of this corporation or any transfer agent for such stock, into such number of
fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the
applicable Original Issue Price for such series by the applicable Conversion Price for such series
(the conversion rate for a series of Preferred Stock into Common Stock is referred to herein as
the “Conversion Rate” for such series), determined as hereafter provided, in effect on the date
the certificate is surrendered for conversion. The initial Conversion Price per share for each
series of Preferred Stock shall be the Original Issue Price applicable to such series; provided,
however, that the Conversion Price for the Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment as set
forth in subsection 4(d).

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall
automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Rate at the time in
effect for such series of Preferred Stock immediately upon the earlier of (i) the closing of this
corporation’s sale of its Common Stock in a firm commitment underwritten public offering
pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 or Form SB~-2 under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended, the public offering price of which exceeds $40,000,000 in the aggregate (a
“Qualified Public Offering”) or (ii) the date specified by written consent or agreement of the

GDSVF&H\ 5
holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (voting together as a
single class and not as separate series, and on an as-converted basis).

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Preferred
Stock shali be entitled to voluntarily convert the same into shares of Common Stock, he or she
shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of this
corporation or of any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to this
corporation at its principal corporate office, of the election to convert the same and shall state
therein the name or names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock are
to be issued. This corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such
office to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a
certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall
be entitled as aforesaid. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior
to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be
converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable
upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such
shares of Common Stock as of such date. Ifthe conversion is in connection with an underwritten
offering of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the
conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering Preferred Stock for conversion, be
conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to such
offering, in which event the persons entitled to receive the Common Stock upon conversion of
the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until
immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities. If the conversion is in connection
with Automatic Conversion provisions of subsection 4(b)(ii) above, such conversion shall be
deemed to have been made on the conversion date described in the stockholder consent
approving such conversion, and the persons entitled to receive shares of Common Stock issuable
upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holders of such shares of
Common Stock as of such date.

(d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock for
Certain Dilutive Issuances, Splits and Combinations. The Conversion Price of the Preferred
Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

(i) (A) If this corporation shall issue, on or after the
date upon which this Restated Certificate of Incorporation is accepted for filing by the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware (the “Filing Date”), any Additional Stock (as defined below)
without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Conversion Price applicable
to a series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional
Stock, the Conversion Price for such series in effect immediately prior to each such issuance
shall forthwith (except as otherwise provided in this clause (i)) be adjusted to a price determined
by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number
of shares of Common Stock Outstanding (as defined below) immediately prior to such issuance
plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received by this ©
corporation for such issuance would purchase at such Conversion Price; and the denominator of
which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock Outstanding (as defined below)
immediately prior to such issuance: plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock. For
purposes of this Section 4(d)(i)(A), the term “Common Stock Outstanding” shall mean and

GDSVF&H\ 6
include the following: (1) outstanding Common Stock, (2) Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of outstanding Preferred Stock, (3) Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
outstanding stock options and (4) Common Stock issuable upon exercise (and, in the case of
warrants to purchase Preferred Stock, conversion) of outstanding warrants. Shares described in
(1) through (4) above shall be included whether vested or unvested, whether contingent or non-
contingent and whether exercisable or not yet exercisable.

(B) No adjustment of the Conversion Price for
the Preferred Stock shall be made in an amount less than one cent per share, provided that any
adjustments that are not required to be made by reason of this sentence shall be carried forward
and shall be either taken into account in any subsequent adjustment made prior to three (3) years
from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward, or shall be made at
the end of three (3) years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried
forward. Except to the limited extent provided for in subsections (E)(3) and (E)(4), no
adjustment of such Conversion Price pursuant to this subsection 4(d)(i) shall have the effect of
increasing the Conversion Price above the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such
adjustment.

(C) In the case of the issuance of Additional
Stock for cash, the consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before
deducting any reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by
this corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale
thereof.

(D) In the case of the issuance of the Additional
Stock for a consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash
shall be deemed to be the fair market value thereof as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors irrespective of any accounting treatment.

(E) In the case of the issuance of options to
purchase or rights to subscribe for Common Stock, securities by their terms convertible into or
exchangeable for Common Stock or options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such
convertible or exchangeable securities, the following provisions shall apply for purposes of
determining the number of shares of Additional Stock issued and the consideration paid therefor:

(1) The aggregate maximum number of
shares of Common Stock deliverable upon exercise (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions
to exercisability, including without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into
account potential antidilution adjustments) of such options to purchase or rights to subscribe for
Common Stock shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such options or rights were
issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in
subsections 4(d)(i)(C) and (d)(i)(D)), if any, received by this corporation upon the issuance of
such options or rights plus the minimum exercise price provided in such options or rights
(without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) for the Common Stock covered
thereby.

GDSVF&H\ 7
(2) The aggregate maximum number of
shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of, or in exchange (assuming the
satisfaction of any conditions to convertibility or exchangeability, including, without limitation,
the passage of time, but without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) for, any
such convertible or exchangeable securities or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights
to subscribe for such convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or
exchange thereof shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or
such options or rights were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration, if any,
received by this corporation for any such securities and related options or rights (excluding any
cash received on account of accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the minimum additional
consideration, if any, to be received by this corporation (without taking into account potential
antidilution adjustments) upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or the exercise of
any related options or rights (the consideration in each case to be determined in the manner
provided in subsections 4(d)(i)(C) and (d)(i)(D)).

(3) In the event of any change in the
number of shares of Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to this
corporation upon exercise of such options or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for
such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock, to the
extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, rights or securities, shall be
recomputed to reflect such change, but no further adjustment shall be made for the actual
issuance of Common Stock or any payment of such consideration upon the exercise of any such
options or rights or the conversion or exchange of such securities.

(4) Upon the expiration of any such
options or rights, the termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of
any options or rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Conversion Price
of the Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such options,
rights or securities or options or rights related to such securities, shall be recomputed to reflect
the issuance of only the number of shares of Common Stock (and convertible or exchangeable
securities that remain in effect) actually issued upon the exercise of such options or rights, upon
the conversion or exchange of such securities or upon the exercise of the options or rights related
to such securities.

(5). The number of shares of Additional
Stock deemed issued and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to subsections

4(d)(i)(E)(1) and (2) shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or
expiration of the type described in either subsection 4(d)(i)(E)(3) or (4).

(ii) | “Additional Stock” shall mean any shares of
Common Stock issued (or deemed to have been issued pursuant to subsection 4(d)(i)(E)) by this
corporation on or after the Filing Date other than:

(A) Common Stock issued pursuant to a
transaction described in subsection 4(d)(iii) hereof;

GDSVF&H\ 8
(B) Common Stock issued pursuant to a stock
dividend;

(C) Common Stock issued pursuant to a

(E) Common Stock issued pursuant to a
Qualified Public Offering;

(F) Common Stock issued pursuant to the
conversion or exercise of convertible or exercisable securities outstanding on the Filing Date;

(G) Common Stock issued in connection with a
bona fide business acquisition of or by this corporation approved by the Board of Directors
whether by merger, consolidation, sale of assets, sale or exchange of stock or otherwise;

(H) Common Stock issued or deemed issued
pursuant to subsection 4(d)(i)(E) as a result of a decrease in the Conversion Price of any series of
Preferred Stock resulting from the operation of this Section 4(d);

" d) Common Stock issued in connection with
joint ventures, development projects or other strategic transactions approved by the Board of
Directors (including the affirmative vote of at least one of the directors elected by holders of
Preferred Stock); or

(J) Common Stock issued to leasing companies,
landlords, lenders and other providers of goods and services to this corporation, provided such
issuances are for other than primarily equity financing purposes, approved by the Board of
Directors (including the affirmative vote of at least one of the directors elected by holders of
Preferred Stock).

(iii) In the event this corporation should at any time or
from time to time after the Filing Date fix a record date for the effectuation of a split or
subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or the determination of holders of
Common Stock entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of
Common Stock or other securities or rights convertible into, or entitling the holder thereof to
receive directly or indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock (hereinafter referred to as
“Common Stock Equivalents”) without payment of any consideration by such holder for the
additional shares of Common Stock or the Common Stock Equivalents (including the additional
shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof), then, as of such record
date (or the date of such dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no record date is fixed), the
Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock shall be appropriately decreased so that the number of
shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be increased
in proportion to such increase of the aggregate of shares of Common Stock outstanding and those

GDSVF&H\ 9
issuable with respect to such Common Stock Equivalents with the number of shares issuable
with respect to Common Stock Equivalents determined from time to time in the manner provided
for deemed issuances in subsection 4(d)(i)(E).

(iv) If the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding at any time after the Filing Date is decreased by a combination of the outstanding
shares of Common Stock, then, following the record date of such combination, the Conversion
Price for the Preferred Stock shall be appropriately increased so that the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be decreased in
proportion to such decrease in the aggregate outstanding shares of Common Stock.

(e) Other_Distributions. In the event this corporation shall
declare a distribution payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by
this corporation or other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not
referred to in subsection 4(d)(iii), then, in each such case for the purpose of this subsection 4(e),
the holders of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any such
distribution as though they were the holders of the number of shares of Common Stock of this
corporation into which their shares of Preferred Stock are convertible as of the record date fixed
for the determination of the holders of Common Stock of this corporation entitled to receive such
distribution.

(f) Recapitalizations. If at any time or from time to time there
shall be a recapitalization of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision, combination or
merger or sale of assets transaction provided for elsewhere in this Section 4 or in Section 2)
provision shall be made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to
receive upon conversion of the Preferred Stock the number of shares of stock or other securities
or property of this corporation or otherwise, to which a holder of Common Stock deliverable
upon conversion would have been entitled on such recapitalization. In any such case,
appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 4 with
respect to the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock after the recapitalization to the end that
the provisions of this Section 4 (including adjustment of the Conversion Price then in effect and
the number of shares purchasable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be applicable
after that event as nearly equivalently as may be practicable.

(g) No Fractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments.

(i) | No fractional shares shall be issued upon the
conversion of any share or shares of the Preferred Stock, and the aggregate number of shares of
Common Stock to be issued to particular stockholders shall be rounded down to the nearest
whole share and the corporation shall pay in cash the fair market value of any fractional shares as
of the time when entitlement to receive such fractions is determined. Whether or not fractional
shares would be issuable upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total
number of shares of Preferred Stock the holder is at the time converting into Common Stock and
the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion.

(i) | Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Conversion Price of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4, this

GDSVF&E\ 10
corporation, at its expense, shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in
accordance with the terms hereof and prepare and furnish to each holder of Preferred Stock a
certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon
which such adjustment or readjustment is based. This corporation shall, upon the written request
at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a
like certificate setting forth (A) such adjustment and readjustment, (B) the Conversion Price for
such series of Preferred Stock at the time in effect, and (C) the number of shares of Common
Stock and the amount, if any, of other property that at the time would be received upon the
conversion of a share of Preferred Stock.

(h) Notices of Record Date. In the event of any taking by this
corporation of a record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the
holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend) or other
distribution, this corporation shall mail to each holder of Preferred Stock, at least ten (10) days
prior to the date specified therein, a notice specifying the date on which any such record is to be
taken for the purpose of such dividend or distribution, and the amount and character of such
dividend or distribution.

(i) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. This
corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares
of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the
Preferred Stock, such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be
sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any
time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to
effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, in addition to such
other remedies as shall be available to the holder of such Preferred Stock, this corporation will
take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient
for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite
stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to this Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

Gj) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this
Section 4 to be given to the holders of shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed given if
deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to each holder of record at
his address appearing on the books of this corporation.

(k) Waiver __of Adjustment _to__Conversion _Price.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any downward adjustment of the Conversion
Price of any series of Preferred Stock may be waived, either prospectively or retroactively and
either generally or in a particular instance, by the consent or vote of the holders of a majority of
the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock. Any such waiver shall bind all future holders of
shares of such series of Preferred Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there shall be no waiver
of any antidilution adjustment applicable to the Series C Preferred Stock without approval by the
holders of a majority of the Series C Preferred Stock.

GDSVF&H\ 11
5. Voting Rights.

(a) General Voting Rights. The holder of each share of
Preferred Stock shall have the right to one vote for each share of Common Stock into which such
Preferred Stock could then be converted, and with respect to such vote, such holder shall have
full voting rights and powers equal to the voting rights and powers of the holders of Common
Stock, and shall be entitled, notwithstanding any provision hereof, to notice of any stockholders’
meeting in accordance with the Bylaws of this corporation, and shall be entitled to vote, together
with holders of Common Stock, with respect to any question upon which holders of Common
Stock have the right to vote. Fractional votes shall not, however, be permitted and any fractional
voting rights available on an as-converted basis (after aggregating all shares into which shares of
