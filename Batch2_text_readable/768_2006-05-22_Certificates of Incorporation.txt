California corporation.

B. The Articles of Incorporation of this corporation are amended and restated in their
entirety to read as follows:

]
The name of this corporation is ATRUA TECHNOLOGIES. INC.

Classes of Stock

l. Conversion of Existing Preferred Stock and Reverse Stock Split. Prior to
the time of the filing of this Fifth Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (the “Articles of

Incorporation’) with the Secretary of State of California (the “Effective Time”), the corporation was
authorized to issue two classes of stock to be designated. respectively, “Common Stock” and
“Preferred Stock” and the corporation had authorized and issued shares of Series A-1 Preferred
Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, all outstanding shares of which have been converted into
Common Stock in accordance with the Fourth Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of
the corporation (the “Conversion’). At the Effective Time each share of Common Stock of the
corporation issued and outstanding or held in the treasury of the corporation immediately prior
thereto (including with shares of Common Stock issued or issuable in connection with the
Conversion) shall be automatically reconstituted and converted into 0.01 shares of Common Stock
(the “Reverse Stock Split’). No further adjustment of any preference or price set forth in this Article
III shall be made as a result of the Reverse Stock Split, as all share amounts per share and per share
numbers set forth in these Articles of Incorporation have been appropriately adjusted to reflect the
Reverse Stock Split. No fractional shares shall be issued upon the Reverse Stock Split. If the
Reverse Stock Split would result in any fractional share, the corporation shall, in lieu of issuing any
such fractional share. pay the holder thereof an amount in cash equal to the fair market value of such
fractional share on the date of the Reverse Stock Split, as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors.

2. Authorized Classes of Stock. From and after the Effective Time the
corporation is authorized to issue two classes of stock to be designated, respectively, “Common
Stock” and “Preferred Stock.” From and after the occurrence of the Reverse Stock Split the total
number of shares which the corporation is authorized to issue will be 35,215,000 shares, each with
no par value per share. 20,300,000 shares shall be Common Stock and 14,915,000 shares shall be
Preferred Stock. The Preferred Stock shall consist of three series designated (i) Series 1 Preferred
Stock (the "Series | Preferred"), consisting of 2,565,000 shares, (ii) Series 2 Preferred Stock (the
"Series 2 Preferred") consisting of 1,850,000 shares and (iii) Series 3 Preferred Stock (the "Series 3
Preferred") consisting of 10,500,000 shares.

IV.

are as set forth below in this Article IV. All section references in this Article IV will be deemed to be
references to sections within this Article IV unless specifically stated otherwise.

by the Board of Directors of the corporation, to dividends out of assets of the corporation legally

prior and in preference to any payment of any dividend on the Common Stock. Thereafter, the
holders of Common Stock and Preferred Stock shall be entitled, when and if declared by the Board
of Directors of the corporation, to dividends out of assets of the corporation legally available
therefor, provided. however, that no such dividend may be declared or paid on any shares of
Common Stock unless at the same time an equivalent dividend is declared or paid on all outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock. and provided further that the dividend on Preferred Stock shall be payable
at the same rate per share as would be payable on the shares of Common Stock or other securities
into which such Preferred Stock is convertible immediately prior to the record date of such dividend.

The right to dividends on shares of the Preferred Stock shal! not be cumulative, and no right shall
accrue to holders of Preferred Stock by reason of the fact that dividends on such shares are not
declared or paid in any prior year.

holders of Series 2 Preferred in proportion to the full preferential amount each such holder would
otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2(b).

(c) Series | Preferred Preference. After the payment or setting apart of payment

funds of the corporation legally available for distribution shall be distributed ratably among the
holders of the Series 1 Preferred in proportion to the full preferential amount each such holder would
otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2(c).

(d) Remaining Assets. After the payment or setting apart of payment of the
Series 2 Preferred Preference and the Series 1 Preferred Preference, the holders of Common Stock.

the Series 2 Preferred Preference and subject to adjustment for any applicable stock splits, reverse
stock splits or similar recapitalizations); provided, further, that if the aggregate amount that would be
payable with respect to the Series 2 Preferred pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2
would be less than the amount payable with respect to such stock if it were then converted into
Common Stock, then in lieu of the foregoing preferential payments, the holders of the Series 2
Preferred Preference, as applicable, shall receive the amount that they would have received if such
stock were then converted into Common Stock.

(e) Shares not Treated as Both Preferred Stock and Common Stock in any

Distribution. Shares of Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to be converted into shares of Common
Stock in order to participate in any distribution. or series of distributions, as shares of Common

power of the corporation: (ii) a sale or exclusive licensing of all or substantially all of the assets of
this corporation; or (iii) a sale of stock by the shareholders of the corporation in any single
transaction or series of related transactions that results in the transfer of fifty (50%) or more of the
outstanding voting power of the corporation (collectively, a "Change of Control") shall be deemed to
be a liquidation within the meaning of this Section 2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction
subject to this Section 2(f) shall not be deemed a liquidation within the meaning of this Section 2 if

class and not as separate series, waive the treatment of such transaction as a liquidation.

(g) | Noncash Distributions. If any of the assets of the corporation are to be
distributed other than in cash under subsections (a), (b) (c) or (d) of this Section 2 or for any

Preferred Stock and Common Stock; provided. however, that in the event the Board of Directors and
the holders of a majority of the Preferred Stock (voting as a single class and on as-converted to
Common Stock basis) agree on the value of the noncash consideration such value shall be used, and
an appraiser shall not be engaged. The corporation shall. upon receipt of such appraiser's valuation

-4.
or upon the date the valuation is determined by the Board of Directors and agreed to by the holders
of Preferred Stock, give prompt written notice to each holder of shares of Preferred Stock of the
appraiser's valuation. Notwithstanding the above, any securities to be distributed to the shareholders
shall be valued as follows:

(i) If traded on a securities exchange or the Nasdaq National Market or
Nasdaq SmallCap Market, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the
securities on such exchange, or the last reported sale prices on the Nasdaq National Market or
Nasdaq SmallCap Market as the case may be, over the thirty (30)-day period ending three (3)
business days prior to the closing;

(ii) If actively traded over-the-counter (other than on the Nasdaq National
Market or Nasdaq SmallCap Market), the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid
prices or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the thirty (30)-day period ending three (3)
business days prior to the closing; and

(iii) If there is no active public market, the value shall be the fair market
value thereof, as mutually determined by the corporation and the holders of not less than a majority
of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (voting as a single class and on as-converted to
Common Stock basis), provided that if the corporation and the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock are unable to reach an agreement, then by independent
appraisal by an investment banker or independent appraiser hired and paid by the corporation, but
acceptable to the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (voting as
a single class and on as-converted to Common Stock basis).

3. Voting Rights.

(a) Vote Other Than for Directors. The holder of each share of Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of shares of Common Stock into which
each share of Preferred Stock could be converted on the record date for the vote or consent of
shareholders. Except as provided in Sections 3(b) and 5 or as otherwise required by law, the
Preferred Stock shall have voting rights and powers equal to the voting rights and powers of the
Common Stock. The holder of each share of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to notice of any
shareholders’ meeting in accordance with the bylaws of the corporation and shall vote with holders
of the Common Stock upon any matter submitted to a vote of shareholders, except as otherwise
expressly provided herein or as required by law to be submitted to a class vote. Fractional votes
shall not, however, be permitted and any fractional voting rights resulting from the above formula
(after aggregating all shares of Common Stock into which shares of Preferred Stock held by each
holder could be converted) shall be rounded to the nearest whole number (with one-half rounded
upward to one).

(b) —_ Election of Directors. Subject to the qualifications set forth below, at each
election of directors. (i) so long as at least 300,000 shares of Series 2 Preferred are outstanding (as

Preferred, voting together as a single class, shall be entitled to elect one (1) member of the
corporation's Board of Directors; (ii) so long as at least 300.000 shares of Series 1 Preferred are

-5-
outstanding (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations or the like), the
holders of the Series 1 Preferred, voting together as a single class, shall be entitled to elect two

(2) members of the corporation's Board of Directors; (iii) the holders of Common Stock, voting
together as a single class, shall be entitled to elect two (2) members of the corporation's Board of
Directors; and (iv) the holders of Common Stock and Preferred Stock. voting as a single class on an
as-converted basis, shall elect the remaining members of the Board of Directors. Except as
otherwise provided by law, any director who was elected by a specified series, class or classes of
shares may be removed during his or her term of office, either for or without cause, by the
affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of the series, class or classes of shares which initially
elected such director. Such vote may be given at a special meeting of such shareholders duly called
or by an action by written consent for that purpose. Vacancies on the Board of Directors may be
filled by (i) the unanimous written consent of the directors then in office, (ii) the affirmative vote of
a majority of the directors then in office at a meeting held pursuant to notice or waivers of notice
complying with Section 307 of the California Corporations Code, or (iii) a sole remaining director of
the Corporation. except that a vacancy created by the removal of a director by court order may be
filled by only the vote of the outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon represented at a duly held
meeting at which a quorum is present, or by an action by written consent for that purpose. Each
director so elected shall hold office until the next annual meeting of shareholders or until a successor
has been elected and qualified. The shareholders of the specified series or class entitled to vote upon
the election of any director from which a vacancy arose may elect a director at any time to fill such
vacancy not filled by the directors.

4. Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock have conversion rights as follows
(the "Conversion Rights"):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the
option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share, at the office of the
corporation or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, into such number of fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Issuance Price by the
Conversion Price, determined as hereinafter provided, in effect at the time of the conversion (the
"Conversion Rate"). The Issuance Price for each of the Series 3 Preferred, Series 2 Preferred and
Series | Preferred shall be $1.05 per share. The Conversion Price for each of the Series 3 Preferred,
Series 2 Preferred and Series 1 Preferred shall initially be its Issuance Price. Such initial Conversion
Prices for the Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment as hereinafter provided.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be
converted into shares of Common Stock at the then effective Conversion Rate (i) on the date
specified by written consent or agreement of the holders of Preferred Stock whose shares of
Preferred Stock, when multiplied by their respective Issuance Prices (subject to adjustment for any
applicable stock splits, reverse stock splits or similar recapitalizations), exceeds fifty percent (50%)
of the product obtained by multiplying (A) the total number of outstanding shares of Preferred Stock
by (B) their respective Issuance Prices (subject to adjustment for any applicable stock splits, reverse
stock splits or similar recapitalizations), or (ii) immediately prior to the closing of a firm
commitment underwritten public offering by the corporation pursuant to an effective registration
statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, that is underwritten by a nationally
recognized investment bank. results in the listing of the corporation's Common Stock on a major

-6-
U.S. stock exchange or the Nasdaq National Market. and results in the issuance by the corporation as
part of such offering of shares of Common Stock at a price per share that is not less than three (3)
times the Issuance Price of the Series 3 Preferred (subject to adjustment for any applicable stock
splits, reverse stock splits or similar recapitalizations) and aggregate proceeds to the corporation
(prior to underwriter commissions and discounts) in excess of $25,000,000 (a "Qualifying Public
Offering"). In the event of such automatic conversion, the holders of Preferred Stock shall not be
deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of the
Qualifying Public Offering.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to convert the same into full shares of Common Stock and to receive certificates therefor,
such holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the
corporation or of any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the
corporation at such office that such holder elects to convert the same; provided, however, that in the
event of an automatic conversion pursuant to Section 4(b), the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock
shall be converted automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and
whether or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the corporation or its
transfer agent, and provided further that the corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates
evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such automatic conversion unless the
certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are either delivered to the corporation or its
transfer agent as provided above, or the holder notifies the corporation or its transfer agent that such
certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the
corporation to indemnify the corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such
certificates. The corporation shall, as soon as practicable after such delivery, or such agreement and
indemnification in the case of a lost certificate, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of
Preferred Stock, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which the
holder shall be entitled as aforesaid and a check payable to the holder in the amount of any cash
amounts payable as the result of a conversion into fractional shares of Common Stock. Such
conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date
of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, or in the case of automatic
conversion on the date of closing of the offering and the person or persons entitled to receive the
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the
record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date.

(d) Fractional Shares. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder of
Preferred Stock would otherwise be entitled, the corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction
multiplied by the then fair market value of one share of the corporation's Common Stock as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. Whether or not fractional shares are issuable
upon such conversion shal] be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Preferred
Stock of each holder at the time converting into Common Stock and the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such aggregate conversion.

(e) Adjustment of Conversion Price. The Conversion Prices of the Series 3
Preferred, Series 2 Preferred and Series | Preferred shall be subject to adjustment from time to time
as follows:

-7-
(i) | If the corporation shall issue (or, pursuant to Section 4(e)(ii)(C) hereof,
shall be deemed to have issued) any Common Stock other than "Excluded Stock" (as defined below)
for a consideration per share less than the Conversion Price of the Series 3 Preferred in effect
immediately prior to the issuance of such Common Stock (excluding stock dividends, subdivisions.
stock splits, combinations, dividends or recapitalizations which are covered by Sections 4(e)(v) and
(vi)), the Conversion Price for the Series 3 Preferred in effect immediately after each such issuance
shall forthwith (except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 4(e)) be adjusted by lowering
the Conversion Price of the Series 3 Preferred Stock to the amount determined be dividing the
aggregate consideration received by the corporation for the issuance or deemed issuance of such
Common Stock by the number of shares of Common Stock issued or deemed issued by the
corporation in the applicable transaction.

(ii) | If the corporation shall issue (or, pursuant to Section 4(e)(11)(C) hereof,
shall be deemed to have issued) any Common Stock other than Excluded Stock for a consideration
per share less than the Conversion Price of the Series 2 Preferred, or the Conversion Price of the
Series 1 Preferred, as the case may be, in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Common
Stock (excluding stock dividends, subdivisions. stock splits, combinations, dividends or
recapitalizations which are covered by Sections 4(e)(v) and (vi)), the Conversion Price for the Series
2 Preferred and/or the Conversion Price for the Series | Preferred, in effect immediately after each
such issuance shall forthwith (except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 4(e)) be
adjusted by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any shares of Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of outstanding Preferred Stock. or issuable upon exercise (and, if applicable,
conversion) of outstanding options, warrants or other convertible securities or deemed to have been
issued pursuant to clause 4(e)(ii)(C)) immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares
of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received by the corporation for such issuance
would purchase at such Conversion Price, and the denominator of which shall be the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of outstanding Preferred Stock, or issuable upon exercise of outstanding options.
warrants or other convertible securities or deemed to have been issued pursuant to clause 4(e)(1i)(C))
immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares of Common Stock issued in the
transaction that resulted in the adjustment pursuant to this Section 4(e)(ii).

(iii) | For the purposes of any adjustment of the Series 3 Conversion Price,
Series 2 Conversion Price and Series | Conversion Price pursuant to clause (i), the following
provisions shall be applicable:

(A) Inthe case of the issuance of Common Stock for cash, the
consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor after deducting any discounts
or commissions paid or incurred by the corporation in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

(B) Inthe case of the issuance of Common Stock for a
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be deemed
to be the fair value thereof as reasonably determined by the Board of Directors of the corporation in
good faith; provided, however, that if, at the time of such determination, the corporation's Common
Stock is traded in the over-the-counter market or on a national or regional securities exchange, such

-8-
fair market value as determined by the Board of Directors of the corporation shall not exceed the
aggregate "Current Market Price" (as defined below) of the shares of Common Stock being issued.

(C) In the case of the issuance of (i) options to purchase or rights to
subscribe for Common Stock, (ii) securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for
Common Stock, or (iii) options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or
exchangeable securities:

(1) the aggregate maximum number of shares of Common
Stock deliverable upon exercise of such options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common
Stock shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such options or rights were issued and for a
consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in clauses 4(e)(i11)(A)
and 4(e)(iii)(B) above), if any, received by the corporation upon the issuance of such options or
rights plus the minimum purchase price provided in such options or rights for the Common Stock
covered thereby;

(2) the aggregate maximum number of shares of Common
Stock deliverable upon conversion of or in exchange for any such convertible or exchangeable
securities, or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or
exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof, shall be deemed to have
been issued at the time such securities were issued or such options or rights were issued and for a
consideration equal to the consideration received by the corporation for any such securities and
related options or rights (excluding any cash received on account of accrued interest or accrued
dividends), plus the additional minimum consideration, if any, to be received by the corporation
upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or the exercise of any related options or rights
(the consideration in each case to be determined in the manner provided in clauses 4(e)(1i)(A) and
4(e)(iii)(B) above);

(3) on any change in the number of shares of Common
Stock deliverable upon exercise of any such options or rights or conversion of or exchange for such
convertible or exchangeable securities. or on any change in the minimum purchase price of such
options, rights or securities, other than a change resulting from the antidilution provisions of such
options, rights or securities, the Series 2 Conversion Price and Series 1 Conversion Price shall
forthwith be readjusted to such Series 2 Conversion Price and Series | Conversion Price as would
have been obtained had the adjustment made upon (x) the issuance of such options. rights or
securities not exercised, converted or exchanged prior to such change or (y) the options or rights
related to such securities not converted or exchanged prior to such change, as the case may be, been
made upon the basis of such change; and

(4) — on the expiration of any such options or rights. the
termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options or rights
related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Series 2 Conversion Price and Series 1]
Conversion Price shall forthwith be readjusted to such Series 2 Conversion Price and Series 1
Conversion Price as would have been obtained had the adjustment made upon the issuance of such
options. rights, convertible or exchangeable securities or options or rights relate to such convertible
or exchangeable securities. as the case may be, been made upon the basis of the issuance of only the

-9.
number of shares of Common Stock actually issued upon the exercise of such options or rights, upon
the conversion or exchange of such convertible or exchangeable securities or upon the exercise of
the options or rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, as the case may be.

after the date hereof is increased by a stock dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or by a
subdivision or split-up of shares of Common Stock, then, on the date such payment is made or such

after the date hereof is decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of Common Stock,
then, on the effective date of such combination, the Conversion Price of Preferred Stock shall be
appropriately increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of
