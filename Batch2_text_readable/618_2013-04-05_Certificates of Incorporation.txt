separate class, shall be entitled to elect five (5) directors of the Corporation (the
“Preferred Directors’); and (ili) the holders of the Preferred Stock and the
Common Stock, voting together as a single class on an as-converted basis shall be
entitled to elect the remaining director of the Corporation.”

respectively; provided, further, that such exclusion shall be limited to a
number of Pinnacle Warrant Shares that, in the aggregate, does not exceed
