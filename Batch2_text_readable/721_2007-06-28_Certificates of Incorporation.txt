ARTICLE Iii

The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which
corporations may be organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

ARTICLE IV

A, The Corporation is authorized to issue two classes of shares to be designated respectively
Preferred Stock (“Preferred Stock”) and Common Stock (“Common Stock”). The total number
of shares of capital stock that the Corporation is authorized to issue is thirty-four million
(34,000,000). The total number of shares of all series of Preferred Stock that the Corporation
shall have authority to issue is fourteen million (14,000,000), par value one-tenth of one cent
($0.001). The total number of shares of Common Stock that the Corporation shal] have authority
to issue is twenty million (20,000,000), par value one-tenth of one cent ($0.001).

B. All the Preferred Stock shall be divided into series. The first series shall consist of six
million (6,000,000) shares and is designated “Series A Preferred Stock,” and the second series
shall consist of eight million (8,000,000) shares and is designated “Series B Preferred Stock.”

C. The powers, rights, preferences, privileges, restrictions and other matters relating to the
Preferred Stock are as follows:

Section ]. Dividends

(a) Dividend Rights. The holders of outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock
and Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, pari passu (that is, in concurrent step
with respect to each other but in proportion to the respective Original Purchase Price of such
Preferred Stock) and out of any funds legally available therefor, distributions, payable in
preference and priority to any distribution on Common Stock dividends at a rate of 8% per share

TAS4RSESW-)
of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, respectively per annum (as adjusted for
stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations and the like) of the Original Purchase Price (as
defined below) of the Preferred Stock, payable ratably when and if declared by the Board of
Directors, such that, and to the extent allowable and subject to such adjustments, each share of
Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to be paid $0.08, and each share of Series B Preferred
Stock shall concurrently be entitled to be paid $0.10. The “Original Purchase Price” of the Series
A Preferred Stock shall be $1.00, and the “Original Purchase Price” of the Series B Preferred
Stock shall be $1.25. No dividends shall be paid on any share of Common Stock unless a
dividend (including the amount of any dividends paid pursuant to the above provisions of this
Section 1) is paid with respect to all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock in an amount for each
such share of Preferred Stock greater than the aggregate amount of such dividends for all shares
of Common Stock into which each such share of Preferred Stock could then be converted. The
right to distributions on the Preferred Stock shall not be cumulative, and no right shall accrue to
holders of Preferred Stock by reason of the fact that distributions on such shares are not declared
or paid in any prior year nor shall any undeclared or unpaid dividend bear or accrue interest. As
used in this Section, “distributions” shall exclude purchases of shares of the Corporation in
connection with the repurchase of shares of Common Stock issued to or held by employees,
consultants, officers and directors pursuant to agreements providing for the right of such
repurchase.

(b) Distributions In-Kind. In the event the Corporation shall declare a distribution
payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by the Corporation or
other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights to purchase any such
securities or evidences of indebtedness, then, in each such case the holders of the Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any such distribution as though the holders of the
Preferred Stock were the holders of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation
into which their respective shares of Preferred Stock are convertible as of the record date fixed
for the determination of the holders of Common Stock of the Corporation entitled to receive such
distribution.

Section 2. Preference on Liquidation

(a) Amount, Priority, Etc.

(i) In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the holders of shares of the Series A Preferred
Stock and Series B Preferred Stock then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid, pari passu (that
is, in concurrent step with each other but in proportion to the respective Original Purchase Price
of such Preferred Stock) and out of the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its
stockholders, whether from capital, surplus or earnings, before any payment shall be made in
respect of the Corporation’s Common Stock, an amount equal to the respective Original Purchase
Price per share of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock (adjusted for any stock
splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations and the like), such that, and to the extent allowable and
subject to such adjustments, each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to be paid
$1.00, and each share of Series B Preferred Stock shall concurrently be entitled to be paid $1.25,
plus all declared but unpaid dividends thereon to the date fixed for distribution. If, upon

2

14S4888S\V-5
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the assets of the Corporation available
for distribution to its stockholders shall be insufficient to pay the holders of the Series A
Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock the full amounts to which they shall be entitled as
set fourth above, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock shall
receive a proportionate percentage pro rata distribution of assets according to the preferential
amounts which would be payable in respect of shares held by them upon such distribution if all
preferential amounts payable on or with respect to such shares were paid in full.

(ii) After the full payment to the holders of the Series A Preferred
Stock and Series B Preferred Stock of the preferential! amounts so payable to them pursuant to
Section 2(a)(i), in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up
of the Corporation, the holders of shares of Common Stock, together with the holders of Series
A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to be paid, pari passu and out of
the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders, whether from capital,
surplus or earnings, an amount distributed ratably among the holders of Common Stock, Series A
Preferred Stock, and Series B Preferred Stock in proportion to the number of shares of Common
Stock (A) then held, with respect to the Common Stock, and (B) into which shares of Series A
Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, are then convertible, provided that each holder of
Series B Preferred Stock (with respect to Series B Preferred Stock only) shall cease to participate
in such distribution after each such holder has received an amount equal to an amount equal to
$2.50 per share of Series B Preferred Stock so held, as adjusted to reflect stock splits, stock
dividends and other recapitalizations, including payments made pursuant to Section 2(a)(i) above
and this Section 2(b){ii).

(b) Shares not Treated as Both Preferred Stock and Common Stock in any
Distribution. For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding Section 4(a) of this Article IV,

Paragraph C with respect to optional conversions or anything else which may be construed to the
contrary herein, shares of Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to be converted into shares of
Common Stock in order to participate in any distribution, or series of distributions, as shares of
Common Stock, without first entirely foregoing participation in the distribution, or series of
distributions, as shares of Preferred Stock.

(c) Merger or Reorganization. For purposes of this Section 2, a liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of this Corporation shall be deemed to include (A) the merger,

consolidation, acquisition of the Corporation, sale of control or other similar transaction of the
Corporation into or with another corporation in which the stockholders of the Corporation
immediately prior to the transaction shall own less than 50% of the voting securities of the
surviving corporation or (B) the sale, transfer or lease (but not including a transfer by pledge or
mortgage to a bona fide lender) of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation (each a
“Liquidation Event”). Subject to dissenters’ rights and other rights under law and the exercise
thereof by the holders of shares of Common Stock and/or Preferred Stock, upon the occurrence
of a Liquidation Event, the entire consideration paid in connection with the relevant transaction
and any other funds and assets of the Corporation legally available for distribution shall be
distributed as provided in this Section 2, and each stockholder shall take the necessary actions to
effect the distribution as provided in this Section 2.

145489 ESV-3
(d) Valuation of Non-Cash Consideration. If any assets of the Corporation distributed
to stockholders in connection with any Liquidation Event are other than cash, then the value of
such assets shall be their fair market value as determined in good faith by the Corporation’s
Board of Directors, except that any publicly-traded securities to be distributed to stockholders in
a Liquidation Event shall, unless otherwise specified in the definitive written agreement(s)
governing such Liquidation Event, be valued as follows:

(i) If the securities are then traded on a national securities exchange
or a national quotation system, then the value of the securities shall be deemed to be the average
of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange or system over the ten (10) trading day
period ending five (5) trading days prior to the distribution; or

(ii) if the securities are actively traded over-the-counter, then the
value of the securities shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid prices of the securities
over the ten (10) trading day period ending five (5) trading days prior to the distribution.

In the event of a merger or other acquisition of the Corporation by another entity, the
distribution date shall be deemed to be the date such transaction closes.

For the purposes of this Section 2(d), “trading day” shal] mean any day which the
nna or system on which the securities to be distributed are traded is open and “closing
prices” or “closing bid prices” shall be deemed to be: (i) for securities traded primarily on the
New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, the last reported trade
price or sale price, as the case may be, at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on that day and (ii) for
securities listed or traded on other exchanges, markets and systems, the market price as of the end
of the regular hours trading period that is generally accepted as such for such exchange, market
or system. If, after the date hereof, the benchmark times generally accepted in the securities
industry for determining the market price of a stock as of a given trading day shall change from
those set forth above, the fair market value shall be determined as of such other generally
accepted benchmark times.

Section 3. Voting.

(a) The holder of each share of Preferred Stock shall have the right to one vote for
each share of Common Stock into which such share of Preferred Stock could then be converted
(with any fractional share determined on an aggregate conversion basis being rounded to the
nearest whole share), and with respect to such vote, such holder shal! have full voting rights and
powers equal to the voting rights and powers of the holders of Common Stock, shall be entitled,
notwithstanding any provision hereof, to notice of any stockholders’ meeting in accordance with
the bylaws of this Corporation, and shall be entitled to vote, together with holders of Common
Stock, with respect to any questions upon which holders of Common Stock have the right to
vote, except as set forth in Section 3(b) of this Article IV, Paragraph C, and otherwise required
by this Certificate of Incorporation or by law. Fractional votes by the holders of Preferred Stock
shall not be permitted and any fractional voting rights resulting from the above formula (after
aggregating all shares into which shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder could be
converted) shall be rounded to the nearest number.

4

143483 5\V-3
(b) So long as at least 25% of the Preferred Stock remains outstanding, the holders of
the Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class, shall be entitled to elect four (4) directors to
the Corporation’s Board of Directors (the “Preferred Designees”). The holders of the Common
Stock, voting together as a single class, shall be entitled to designate two (2) directors to the
Corporation’s Board of Directors (the “Common Designees”). Any additional members of the
Corporations Board of Directors shal! be elected by the holders of Common Stock and Preferred
Stock, voting together as a single class. Any vacancies on the Corporation’s Board of Directors
shall be filled by vote of the holders of the class of stock originally entitled to elect the director
whose absence or resignation created such vacancy.

(c) Additionally, and in accordance with Section 141(k) of the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware, any director who is a Preferred Designee or Common Designee
may be removed, in respect to the removal without cause of such a director, only by the
affirmative vote of the of the holders of the shares of the class or series of capital stock entitled to
elect such director or directors.

Section 4. Conversion

(a) Optional and Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be
convertible at the option of the holder thereof at any time into fully paid and nonassessable shares
of Common Stock of the Corporation. Each and every share of Preferred Stock shall
automatically be converted into fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock of the
Corporation (i) upon approval by vote or written consent of the holders of sixty percent (60%) or
more of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding, or (ii) immediately upon the
closing of the sale of the Corporation’s Common Stock in a firm commitment, underwritten
public offering registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Securities Act”),
covering the offer and sale of Common Stock for the account of the Company in which (A) the
per share price (before deduction of underwriting commissions and expenses) is determined from
a valuation of the Corporation, immediately prior to the offering, of at least fifty million dollars
($50,000,000) and (B) the gross proceeds to the Corporation (before deduction of underwriting
commissions and expenses) are at least twenty million dollars ($20,000,000) (the “Initial
Qualified Public Offering”).

(b) Conversion Price. The number of shares of Common Stock into which each share
of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock may be converted shall be
determined by dividing the respective Original Purchase Price, plus accrued and unpaid
dividends, by the Conversion Price (determined as hereinafter provided) in effect at the time of
the conversion. The price at which shares of Common Stock shall! be deliverable upon
conversion of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock shall initially
be the respective Original Purchase Price per share of Common Stock. Such initial “Conversion
Price” shall be adjusted as hereinafter provided. :

(c) Procedure for Conversion. The holder of any shares of Preferred Stock may
exercise the conversion rights as to such shares or any part thereof by delivering to the
Corporation during regular business hours, at the Corporation’s principal office or at the office of
any transfer agent of the Corporation for the Preferred Stock, or at such other place as may be

5

1454988 S\Y-3
designated by the Corporation, the certificate or certificates for the shares to be converted, duly
endorsed for transfer to the Corporation (if required by it), accompanied by written notice stating
that the holder elects to convert such shares. Conversion shall be deemed to have been effected
on the date when such delivery is made, or the conditions for automatic conversion set forth in
subsection 4(a) above have been satisfied, and such date is referred to herein as the “Conversion
Date.” As promptly as practicable thereafter the Corporation shall issue and deliver to or upon
the written order of such holder, at such office or other place designated by the Corporation, a
certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled and a check for cash with respect to any fractional interest in a share of Common Stock
as provided in subsection 4(d) below. The holder shall be deemed to have become a stockholder
of record on the applicable Conversion Date unless the transfer books of the Corporation are
closed on that date, in which event the holder shall be deemed to have become a stockholder of
record on the next succeeding date on which the transfer books are open, but the Conversion
Price shall be that in effect on the Conversion Date. Upon conversion of only a portion of the
number of shares of Preferred Stock represented by a certificate surrendered for conversion, the
Corporation shall issue and deliver to or upon the written order of the holder of the certificate so
surrendered for conversion, at the expense of the Corporation, a new certificate covering the
number of shares of Preferred Stock representing the unconverted portion of the certificate so
surrendered.

(d) NoFractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall-be issued
upon conversion of shares of Preferred Stock. If more than one share of Preferred Stock shal! be
surrendered for conversion at any one time by the same holder, the number of ful! shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate
number of shares of Preferred Stock so surrendered. Instead of any fractional shares of Common
Stock which would otherwise be issuable upon conversion of any shares of Preferred Stock, the
Corporation shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fractional interest equal to the fair
market value of such fractional interest as determined in good faith by the Corporation’s Board
of Directors.

{e) Common Stock Reserve. The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep
available, out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting
the conversion of the Preferred Stock, the full number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
the conversion of all Preferred Stock from time to time outstanding, The Corporation shall from
time to time (subject to obtaining necessary director and stockholder action), in accordance with
the laws of the State of Delaware, increase the authorized amount of its Common Stock if at any
time the authorized number of shares of its Common Stock remaining unissued shall not be
sufficient to permit the conversion of all of the shares of Preferred Stock at the time outstanding.

(f) Status of Converted Stock, All certificates of Preferred Stock surrendered for
conversion shall be appropriately canceled on the books of the Corporation, and the shares so
converted shall be restored to the status of authorized but unissued Preferred Stock of the
Corporation, undesignated as to series.

IASARSES\V-3
(g) Notice of Certain Events. In case:

(i) the Corporation shall take a record of the holders of its Common
Stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend, or any other distribution, payable
otherwise than in cash; or

(ii) the Corporation shall take a record of the holders of its Common
Stock for the purpose of entitling them to subscribe for or purchase any shares of stock of any
class or to receive any other rights; or

(iii) of any capital reorganization of the Corporation, reclassification
of the capital stock of the Corporation (other than a subdivision or combination of its outstanding
shares of Common Stock), or a consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into another
corporation or conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation to another
corporation;

then, and in any such case, the Corporation shall cause to be mailed by first class mail to the
transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, and to the holders of record of the outstanding Preferred
Stock, at least ten (10) days prior to the date hereinafter specified, a notice stating the date on
which (x) a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or nights, or

(y) such reclassification, reorganization, consolidation, merger or conveyance is to take place and
the date, if any is to be fixed, as of which holders of Common Stock of record shall be entitled to
exchange their shares of Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such
reclassification, reorganization, consolidation, merger, conveyance, dissolution, liquidation or
winding up.

Section 5. Adjustment of Conversion Price.

The Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock from time to time in effect shall be subject to
adjustment from time to time as follows:

(a) Stock Dividends, Stock Splits, Etc. In case the Corporation shall at any time
subdivide the outstanding shares of Common Stock, or shall issue a stock dividend on its
outstanding Common Stock, the Conversion Price of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B
Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such subdivision or the issuance of such dividend
shall be proportionately decreased, and in cese the Corporation shall at any time combine the
outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price of the Series A Preferred Stock and
Series B Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such combination shall be proportionately
increased, effective at the close of business on the date of such subdivision, dividend or
combination, as the case may be.

(b) Reorganization, Etc. In case of any capital reorganization (other than a
subdivision or combination of outstanding shares or a transaction deemed to be a liquidation,
dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation pursuant to Section 2(b) above) or any
reclassification of the capital stock of the Corporation, each share of Series A Preferred Stock
and Series B Preferred Stock shall thereafter be convertible into the number of shares of stock or

taSa2gasw-3
other securities or property to which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the
Corporation deliverable upon conversion of such Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred
Stock would have been entitled upon such reorganization or reclassification; and, in any such
case, appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) shall be
made in the application of the provisions herein set forth with respect to the rights and interests
thereafter of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, to the end
that the provisions set forth herein (including provisions with respect to changes in and other
adjustments of the Conversion Price) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may
be, in relation to any share of stock or other property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion
of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock.

(c)  Issuances at Less Than The Conversion Price. Upon the issuance by the
Corporation of Common Stock, or any right or option to purchase Common Stock or stock
convertible into Common Stock, or any obligation or any share of stock convertible into or
exchangeable for Common Stock for a consideration per share less than the Conversion Price of
the Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to the time
of such issue or sale other than an issuance of stock or securities pursuant to subsections 5(a) or
5(b) or the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of any Series A Preferred
Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, then forthwith upon such issue or sale, the Conversion Price
of the Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, as the case may be, shall be reduced
to a price (calculated to the nearest cent)-determined by multiplying the then existing Conversion
Price by a fraction:

(i) the numerator of which shall be, an amount equal to the sum of
(x) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale,
and (y) the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate “consideration actually
received” (as defined below) by the Corporation upon such issue or sale would purchase at such
existing Conversion Price; and

(ii) | the denominator of which shall be, the sum of the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such issue or sale and Additional Stock
(as defined below).

For purposes of this subparagraph 5(c), the following provisions will be applicable:

(A) _ In the case of an issue or sale for cash of shares of Common Stock,
the “consideration actually received” by the Corporation therefor shall be deemed to be the
amount of cash received, before deducting therefrom any commissions or expenses paid by the
Corporation.

(B) ‘Incase of the issuance (otherwise than upon conversion or
exchange of obligations or shares of stock of the Corporation) of additional shares of Common
Stock for a consideration other than cash or a consideration partly other than cash, the amount of
the “consideration actually received” by the Corporation for such shares shall be deemed to be
the fair market value of such consideration as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

1454888 NY-3
(C) Incase of the issuance by the Corporation in any manner of any
rights to subscribe for or to purchase shares of Common Stock, or any options for the purchase of
shares of Common Stock or stock convertible into Common Stock, all shares of Common Stock
or stock convertible into Common Stock to which the holders of such rights or options shall be
entitled to subscribe for or purchase pursuant to such rights or options shall be deemed
“outstanding” as of the date of the offering of such rights or the granting of such options, as the
case may be, and the minimum aggregate consideration named in such rights or options for the
shares of Common Stock or stock convertible into Common Stock covered thereby, plus the
consideration, if any, received by the Corporation for such rights or options, shal! be deemed to
be the “consideration actually received” by the Corporation (as of the date of the offering of such
rights or the granting of such options, as the case may be) for the issuance of such shares.

(D) Incase of the issuance or issuances by the Corporation in any
manner of any obligations or of any shares of stock of the Corporation that shall be convertible
into or exchangeable for Common Stock, all shares of Common Stock issuable upon the
conversion or exchange of such obligations or shares shal] be deemed issued as of the date such
obligations or shares are issued, and the amount of the “consideration actually received” by the
Corporation for such additional shares of Common Stock shall be deemed to be the total of
(X) the amount of consideration received by the Corporation upon the issuance of such
obligations or shares, as the case may be, plus (Y) the minimum aggregate consideration, if any,
other than such obligations or shares, receivable by the Corporation upon such conversion or
exchange, except in adjustment of dividends.

(E) The amount of the “consideration actually received” by the

Corporation upon the issuance of any rights or options referred to in subsection (C) above or
upon the issuance of any obligations or shares which are convertible or exchangeable as
described in subsection (D) above, and the amount of the consideration, if any, other than such
obligations or shares so convertible or exchangeable, receivable by the Corporation upon the
exercise, conversion or exchange thereof shall be determined in the same manner provided in
subsections (A) and (B) above with respect to the consideration received by the Corporation in
case of the issuance of additional shares of Common Stock; provided, however, that if such
obligations or shares of stock so convertible or exchangeable are issued in payment or
satisfaction of any dividend upon any stock of the Corporation other than Common Stock, the
amount of the “consideration actually received” by the Corporation upon the original issuance of
such obligations or shares or stock so convertible or exchangeable shall be deemed to be the
value of such obligations or shares of stock, as of the date of the adoption of the resolution
declaring such dividend, as determined by the Board of Directors at or as of that date. On the

‘ expiration of any rights or options referred to in subsection (C), or the termination of any right of
conversion or exchange referred to in subsection (D), or any change in the number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable upon exercise of such options or rights or upon conversion of or
exchange of such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Conversion Price then in effect shall
forthwith be readjusted to such Conversion Price as would have obtained had the adjustments
made upon the issuance of such options, rights or convertible or exchangeable securities been
made upon the basis of the delivery of only the number of shares of common stock actually
delivered or to be delivered upon the exercise of such rights or options or upon the conversion or
exchange of such securities.

14558885\V-3
(F) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Corporation
shall not be required to make any adjustment of the Conversion Price in the case of (the below
referred to herein as “Additional Stock”):

(i) up to an aggregate of 956,938 shares of Common Stock (as
adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations and the like) issued or issuable from
the date hereto to officers, directors, employees or consultants of the Corporation and its
subsidiaries pursuant to stock grant, stock purchase and/or stock option plans or any other stock
incentive program, arrangement or agreement approved by the Corporation’s Board of Directors,
which shall include the approval of all of the Preferred Designecs;

(ii) shares issued in the Initial Qualified Public Offering;

(iii) | shares issued or issuable in connection with the exercise,
conversion or exchange of warrants issued by the Corporation in connection with a bank (or
similar institution) financing or strategic partnership approved by the Corporation’s Board of
Directors, which shall include the approval of all of the Preferred Designees;

{iv) shares issued in an acquisition by the Corporation of
another business or technology or product line that is approved by the Corporation’s Board of
Directors, which shall include the approval of all of the Preferred Designees;

(v) any shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock that may
be issued upon exercise or conversion of any security outstanding on the date this Second
Restated Certificate of Incorporation is filed; or

(vi) any shares of Common Stock that may be issued upon
conversion of the Preferred Stock.

(G) In the event the Corporation shall! declare a distribution payable in
securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by the Corporation or other persons
or options or rights not referred to in this subsection (5c), then, in each such case, the holders of
the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to the distribution
at the rate provided for in Section | above, and no adjustment to the Conversion Price provided
for in this Section 5 shall be applicable.

For purposes of the foregoing, the per share consideration with respect to the sale or
issuance of Preferred Stock shall be the price per share received by the Corporation, prior to the
payment of any expenses, commissions, discounts and other applicable costs.

(d) Nonimpairment. Subject to the right of the Corporation to amend this Certificate
upon obtaining necessary approvals required by this Certificate and applicable law, the
Corporation will not, by amendment of its Certificate of Incorporation or through any
reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or
any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the
terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Corporation, but will at all times in good
faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Section 5 and in the taking of all such

10

1434BSES\V-]
action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holders
of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock against impairment.

(e) Certificate of Adjustment. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 5, the Corporation, at its expense,
shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and
furnish to each holder of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock affected thereby
a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon
which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon the written request
at any time of any holder of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, furnish or
cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (1) such adjustment or
readjustment, (2) the Conversion Price at the time in effect, and (3) the number of shares of
Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received

series of related transactions approved by a majority of the Board of Directors) an equity
financing in which it sells equity securities with aggregate proceeds to the Corporation of at least
eight million dollars ($8,000,000) (a “Qualified Financing”), then each holder who owns Series
A Preferred Stock must purchase its Requisite Amount (as defined below). In the event a holder
of Series A Preferred Stock elects not to purchase all of its Requisite Amount (as defined below),
then, effective immediately after the first closing of such Qualified Financing, cach share of such
holder’s Series A Preferred Stock shall automatically and without further action on the part of
such holder be converted into one (1) share (the “Pay-to-Play Conversion Ratio”) of Common
Stock. Upon conversion pursuant to this Section 5(f), the shares of Series A Preferred Stock so
converted shall be canceled and shall not be subject to reissuance. For the purposes of this
Section 5(f), the following definitions shail apply:

(A) the “Requisite Amount” shall mean the total number of
shares of securities equal to: the quotient of (1) the aggregate investment amount by the subject
holder in its purchase of Series A Preferred Stock in the prior equity financing consummated on
December 19, 2005, divided by (2) the price per share of the securities to be issued in the
Qualified Financing;

(B) an “Affiliate” shall mean, with respect to any person or
entity, a person or entity that, directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls,
is controlled by or is under common contro] with the first person or entity; and

(ii) | For the avoidance of doubt and for purpose of determining whether
a Series A Preferred Stock holder has purchased its Requisite Amount, the amount of all shares
of such securities purchased in the Qualified Financing by such Series A Preferred Stock holder
and all Affiliates of such Series A Preferred Stock holder will be aggregated (but without
duplication with respect to Affiliates of each other), provided, however, that, for purposes of this
Section 5(f) and purposes set forth in this Section 5(f)(ii), NMSIC Classic LLC, NMSIC Co-
Investment Fund LLP, or Sun Mountain Capital Partners (and/or its managing partners), shall not
be deemed to be a holder or an “Affiliate” of any holder of Series A Preferred Stock.

(iii) | The holder of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock converted
pursuant to this Section 5(f) shall deliver to the Corporation during regular business hours at the
office of any transfer agent of the Corporation of such Series A Preferred Stock, or at such other
place as may be designated by the Corporation, the certificate or certificates representing the
shares so converted, duly endorsed or assigned in blank or to the Corporation. As promptly
thereafter as is practicable, the Corporation shall issue and deliver to such holder, at the place
designated by such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common
Stock to which such holder is entitled. The person in whose name the certificate for such shares
of Common Stock is to be issued shall be deemed to have become a stockholder on the effective
date of the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, unless the transfer books of the
Corporation are closed on the date, in which case such person shall be deemed to have become a
stockholder of record on the next succeeding date on which the transfer books are open.
