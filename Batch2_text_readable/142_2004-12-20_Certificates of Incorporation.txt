number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of their respective shares of
Series A-1, Series A-2, Series B-1 or Series C as of the record date fixed for the determination of
the holders of shares of Common Stock entitled to receive such distribution.

2. Liquidation Preference.

(a) Series C. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up
of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of shares of Series C shall be
entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any distribution of any of the assets or surplus funds
of the Corporation to the holders of Series C Junior Securities (as defined below) by reason of
their ownership thereof, an amount equal to $0.76 per share (as adjusted for any
Recapitalization) (the “Series C Issue Price”) plus all accrued but unpaid dividends on such
shares of Series C then held by them. If, upon any liquidation, distribution, or winding up of the
Corporation, the assets and surplus funds of the Corporation shall be insufficient to make
payment in full of the aforesaid preferential amounts to all holders of shares of Series C, such
assets and surplus funds shall be distributed ratably among the holders of Series C then
outstanding in proportion to the full preferential amounts to which each holder of shares of
Series C would otherwise be entitled. The term “Series C Junior Securities” means any capital
stock or other equity securities of the Corporation, except for the Series C.

(b) Series B-1. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding
up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, after the payment in full of all amounts
payable to the holders of the Series C pursuant to Section 2(a) above, the holders of shares of
Series B-1 shall be entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any distribution of any of the
assets or surplus funds of the Corporation to the holders of Series B-1 Junior Securities (as
defined below) by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount equal to $0.70183 per share (as
adjusted for any Recapitalization) (the “Series B-1 Issue Price”) plus all accrued but unpaid

or winding up of the Corporation, the assets and surplus funds of the Corporation shall be
insufficient to make payment in full of the aforesaid preferential amounts to all holders of shares
of Series B-1, such assets and surplus funds shall be distributed ratably among the holders of
Series B-1 then outstanding in proportion to the full preferential amounts to which each holder of
shares of Series B-1 would otherwise be entitled. The term “Series B-1 Junior Securities” means
any capital stock or other equity securities of the Corporation, except for the Series C and Series
B-1.

(c) Series A-1 and Series A-2. In the event of any liquidation,

dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, after the
payment in full of all amounts payable to the holders of the Series C and Series B-1 pursuant to

-3-
Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, (i) the holders of shares of Series A-1 shall be entitled to receive,
prior and in preference to any distribution of any of the remaining assets or surplus funds of the
Corporation to the holders of shares of Common Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, an
amount equal to the sum of $0.249783 per share (as adjusted for any Recapitalization) (the
“Series A-1 Issue Price”) and (ii), the holders of shares of Series A-2 shall be entitled to receive,
prior and in preference to any distribution of any of the assets or surplus funds of the Corporation
to the holders of shares of Common Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount equal
to $2.123241 per share (as adjusted for any Recapitalization with respect to shares of Series A-2)

Corporation, the assets and surplus funds of the Corporation remaining after the payments to the
holders of the Series C and Series B-1 required under Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above shall be
insufficient to make payment in full of the aforesaid preferential amounts to all holders of shares
of Series A-1 or Series A-2, such assets and surplus funds shall be distributed ratably among the
holders of Series A-1 or Series A-2 then outstanding in proportion to the full preferential
amounts to which each holder of shares of Series A-1 or Series A-2 would otherwise be entitled.

(d) Following the payment of the preferential amounts required by
Sections 2(a), 2(b) and 2(c) hereof, the remaining assets and surplus funds of the Corporation
legally available for distribution to stockholders, if any, shall be distributed ratably among the
holders of shares of Series B-1, Series A-1, Series A-2 and Common Stock based on the number
of shares of Common Stock held by each (assuming conversion of all such Preferred Stock into
Common Stock pursuant to Section 4 hereof) until each such holder has received (A) with
respect to Series B-1, an aggregate of $1.40366 per share (excluding all paid and accrued
dividends); (B) with respect to Series A-1, an aggregate of $0.499566 per share; and (C) with
respect to Series A-2, an aggregate of $4.246482 per share, in the case of each of clauses (A),
(B), and (C) including the amounts per share received pursuant to Sections 2(b) and 2(c) hereof
(but excluding all paid and accrued dividends on the Series B-1 Preferred) and in each case as
adjusted for any Recapitalization. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, in the event
that the amount distributed with respect to the shares of a particular series of Preferred Stock
pursuant to this Section 2 would be greater if all such shares were converted into Common Stock
pursuant to Section 4 hereof (assuming the simultaneous operation of this sentence with respect
to all other series of Preferred Stock), then the holder of each share of such series of Preferred
Stock shall receive, in lieu of any other payment pursuant to this Section 2 with respect to such
share, the amount such holder would have received had such holder converted such share into
Common Stock pursuant to Section 4 hereof. If assets and surplus funds remain in the
Corporation after payment of the full preferential amounts to the holders of shares of Series C,
Series B-1, Series A-1 and Series A-2 pursuant to Sections 2(a). 2(b) and 2(c) hereof and this
Section 2(d), such remaining assets and surplus funds shall be distributed ratably among the
holders of shares of Common Stock in proportion to the aggregate number of shares of Common
Stock then held by each such holder.

Corporation by means of a sale of outstanding capital stock, a merger or other form of corporate
reorganization (other than a transaction effected solely to reincorporate the Corporation in
another jurisdiction) and pursuant to which the holders of the outstanding voting securities of the
Corporation immediately prior to such consolidation, merger or other transaction fail to hold (in
substantially the same proportions) equity securities representing a majority of the voting power

4.
and economic rights of the Corporation or surviving entity immediately following such sale,
consolidation, merger or other transaction; or (ii) a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of
the Corporation, shall be treated as a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation
and shail entitle the holders of shares of Series A-1, Series A-2, Series B-1 or Series C to receive
at the closing of such transaction in cash, securities or other property (valued in accordance with
the terms of Section 2(f) hereof) the preferential amounts set forth in Sections 2(a), 2(b), 2(c) and
2(d) hereof.

(f) In the event that any distribution contemplated by this Section 2
shall be payable in securities or property other than cash, the value of such distribution shall be
the fair market value of such securities or other property, valued as follows:

(i) if traded on a securities exchange or through the Nasdaq
National Stock Market, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the
securities on such exchange or system over the thirty (30) day period ending three (3) days prior
to the date of such distribution;

(ii) if actively traded over-the-counter but not on the Nasdaq
National Stock Market, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale
prices (whichever is applicable) over the thirty (30) day period ending three (3) days prior to the
date of such distribution, and

(iii) if there is no active market, the value shall be the fair
market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

provided, that no distribution may be made to the Series C in any form
other than in cash unless all Series C Junior Securities are also paid in such non-cash
consideration, and no distribution may be made to the Series B-1 in any form other than in cash
untess all Series B-1 Junior Securities are also paid in such non-cash consideration,

provided, further, that, to the extent practicable, if such distribution with
respect to the Series C is comprised of both cash and noncash consideration, distributions upon
all Series C Junior Securities shall be comprised of the same ratio of cash to such non-cash
consideration, and that, to the extent practicable, if such distribution with respect to the Series B-
1 is comprised of both cash and noncash consideration, distributions upon all Series B-1 Junior
Securities shall be comprised of the same ratio of cash to such non-cash consideration.

3. Redemption.
(a) Series B-1 and Series C Terms of Redemption.

(i) Optional Redemption. At any time after November 28,
2010, each holder of outstanding shares of Series B-1 or Series C may require that the
Corporation redeem all or any portion of the shares held by such holder. For purposes of this
Section 3, “Senior Preferred Redemption Date” shall mean the date specified for such
redemption in the notice delivered to the Corporation by each such holder of Series B-1 or Series
C: provided that except as provided in the following sentence, such date shall be no earlier than

-5-
thirty (30) days following the date such notice is delivered to the Corporation. At least fifteen
(15) days prior to each Senior Preferred Redemption Date, the Corporation shall inform each
other holder of shares of Series B-1 and/or Series C of such notice and invite such holders to
require that the Corporation redeem all or any portion of such holder’s shares of Series B-1 or
Series C on such Senior Preferred Redemption Date by delivering, or causing to be delivered, to
each holder of record (at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on
which notice is given) of issued and outstanding shares of Series B-1 and/or Series C by
registered first class mail, postage prepaid, at the address last shown on the records of the
Corporation for each such holder, notice of the redemption to be effected, the Senior Preferred
Redemption Date, the place at which payment may be obtained and, if pursuant to Section
3(a)(iii) below less than all of the Series B-1 and Series C for which redemption has been

requested on such Redemption Date to be redeemed, specifying the maximum number of shares
of Series B-1 and Series C to be redeemed on such Redemption Date and calling upon each such
holder to surrender to the Corporation, in the manner and at the place designated, his, her or its
certificate or certificates representing the shares of Series B-1 and/or Series C to be so redeemed
(the “Senior Preferred Redemption Notice”), and each holder of Series B-1 or Series C may join
in such request for redemption as of such Senior Preferred Redemption Date by delivering notice
of such election to the Corporation no later than five (5) days prior to such Senior Preferred
Redemption Date.

(ii) | Redemption Payments, On or before each Senior Preferred
Redemption Date, each holder of shares of Series B-1 or Series C electing to have shares of
Series B-1 or Series C redeemed by the Corporation pursuant to this Section 3(a) will surrender
to the Corporation the certificate or certificates representing such shares in the manner and at the
place designated in the Senior Preferred Redemption Notice. For each share of Series B-1 and
Series C so surrendered on or before such Senior Preferred Redemption Date, the Corporation
shall be obligated on such Senior Preferred Redemption Date to pay to the order of the holder
whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof an amount in cash
equal to the Series B-1 Issue Price (plus all declared, accrued and unpaid dividends thereon) or
Series C Issue Price (plus all declared, accrued and unpaid dividends thereon) for each such
share, as the case may be, and each surrendered certificate shall be cancelled. In the event that
less than all the shares of Series B-1 or Series C represented by any such certificate are redeemed
pursuant to this Section 3(a), a new certificate representing the unredeemed shares of Series B-1
or Series C, as the case may be, shall be issued and delivered by the Corporation or its designated
transfer agent to the holder whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner
thereof.

(iii) Priority. In the case of any request for redemption made
prior to May 28, 2011, if the funds of the Corporation legally available for redemption of shares
of Series B-1 or Series C on any Senior Preferred Redemption Date are insufficient to redeem the
total number of shares of Series B-1 and Series C to be redeemed on such date, those funds
which are legally available shall be used to redeem the maximum possible number of such shares
pro rata among the holders of the shares of Series B-1 and Series C to be redeemed based upon
the aggregate Series B-1 Issue Price and Series C Issue Price of such shares held by each such
holder (plus all declared, accrued and unpaid dividends thereon). Following such Senior
Preferred Redemption Date, the Corporation shall use its best efforts to complete such
redemption as promptly as practicable, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Restated

6
Certificate, no capital stock of the Corporation (including, without limitation, any other Preferred
Stock) shall be redeemed on any subsequent Senior Preferred B-1 Redemption Date or Series A
Redemption Date (as defined below) until all shares of Series B-1 and Series C for which
redemption was previously properly requested as of an earlier Senior Preferred Redemption Date
have been redeemed. In the case of any request for redemption made on or after May 28, 2011,
those funds which are then legally available or which shall become legally available from time to
time thereafter, shall immediately be used to redeem first, all shares of Series C, Series B-1,
Series A-1 or Series A-2 for which redemption was properly requested as of an earlier Senior
Preferred Redemption Date or Series A Redemption Date, with priority in order of time
(meaning that all shares for which redemption was requested on the earlier of any such dates
shall be redeemed in full prior to the redemption of any shares for which redemption was
requested as of a later date), and thereafter the maximum possible number of such shares of
Series B-1 and Series C and all such shares of Series A-1 and Series A-2 redeemed as of such
date pursuant to Section 3(b) below pro rata among such holders of the shares of Series C, Series
B-1, Series A-1 and Series A-2 based upon the aggregate Series C Issue Price, Series B-1 Issue
Price, Series A-1 Issue Price or Series A-2 Issue Price, as the case may be, of such shares of
Series C, Series B-1, Series A-1 or Series A-2 held by each such holder.

(iv) Dividends After Senior Preferred Redemption Date. No
shares of Series B-1 or Series C shall be entitled to any dividends accruing after the date on
which the Series B-1 Issue Price or Series C Issue Price, as the case may be, of such share (plus
all declared, accrued and unpaid dividends thereon) is paid to the holder of such share. On such
date, all rights of the holder of such share shall cease, and such share shall no longer be deemed
to be issued and outstanding.

(b) Series A-1 and Series A-2 Terms of Redemption.

(i) Optional Redemption. At any time after May 28, 2011,
each holder of outstanding shares of Series A-1 or Series A-2 may require at any time thereafter
that the Corporation redeem all or any portion of such shares. For purposes of this Section 3
“Series A Redemption Date” shal! mean the date specified for such redemption in the notice
delivered to the Corporation by such holders of either Series A-1 or Series A-2; provided that
except as provided in the following sentence, such date shall be no earlier than thirty (30) days
following the date such notice is delivered to the Corporation. At least fifteen (15) days prior to
each Series A Redemption Date, the Corporation shal! inform each other holder of shares of
Series C, Series B-1, Series A-1 or Series A-2 of such notice and invite such holders to require
that the Corporation redeem all or any portion of such holder’s shares of Series C, Series B-1,
Series A-1 or Series A-2, as the case may be, on such Series A Redemption Date by delivering,
or causing to be delivered, to each holder of record (at the close of business on the business day
next preceding the day on which notice is given) of issued and outstanding shares of Series C,
Series B-1, Series A-1 or Series A-2 by registered first class mail, postage prepaid, at the address
last shown on the records of the Corporation for each such holder, notice of the redemption to be
effected and, if pursuant to Section 3(b)(iii) below less than all of the Series A-1 or Series A-2
for which redemption has been requested on such Redemption Date to be redeemed, specifying
the maximum number of shares of Series C, Series B-1, Series A-1 or Series A-2, as the case
may be, that may be redeemed from cach such holder, the Series A Redemption Date, the place
at which payment may be obtained and calling upon each such holder to surrender to the

7-

Corporation, in the manner and at the place designated, his, her or its certificate or certificates
representing the shares of Series C, Series B-1, Series A-1 or Series A-2 to be so redeemed (the
“Series A Redemption Notice”), and each holder of Series A-1, Series A-2, Series B-1 or Series
C may join in such request for redemption as of such Series A Redemption Date by delivering
notice of such election to the Corporation no later than five (5) days prior to such Series A
Redemption Date.

(ii) | Redemption Payments. On or before each Series A
Redemption Date, each holder of shares of Series C, Series B-1, Series A-1 or Series A-2
electing to have shares of Series C, Series B-1, Series A-1 or Series A-2 redeemed by the
Corporation pursuant to this Section 3(b) will surrender to the Corporation the certificate or
certificates representing such shares in the manner and at the place designated in the Series A
Redemption Notice. For each share of Series C, Series B-1, Series A-1 or Series A-2 so
surrendered on or before such Series A Redemption Date, the Corporation shall be obligated on
such Series A Redemption Date to pay to the order of the holder whose name appears on such
certificate or certificates as the owner thereof an amount in cash equal to the Series C Issue Price
(plus all declared, accrued and unpaid dividends thereon), Series B-1 Issue Price (plus all
declared, accrued and unpaid dividends thereon), Series A-1 Issue Price or Series A-2 Issue Price
for each such share, as the case may be, and each surrendered certificate shall be cancelled. In
the event that less than all the shares of Series C, Series B-1, Series A-1 or Series A-2
represented by any such certificate are redeemed pursuant to this Section 3(b), a new certificate
representing the unredeemed shares of Series C, Series B-1, Series A-1 or Series A-2, as the case
may be, shall be issued and delivered by the Corporation or its designated transfer agent to the
holder whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof.

(iii) Priority. If the funds of the Corporation remaining after
completion of all redemptions requested as of earlier dates but not yet paid and legally available
for redemption of shares of Series C, Series B-1, Series A-1 or Series A-2 on any Series A
Redemption Date are insufficient to redeem the total number of shares of Series C, Series B-1,
Series A-1 or Series A-2 to be redeemed on such date, those remaining funds which are then
legally available or which shall become legally available from time to time thereafter, shall
immediately be used to redeem the maximum possible number of such shares pro rata among
the holders of the shares of Series C, Series B-1, Series A-1 and Series A-2 to be so redeemed
based upon the aggregate Series C Issue Price (or portion thereof not yet paid pursuant to Section
3(a) above, if applicable), Series B-1 Issue Price (or portion thereof not yet paid pursuant to
Section 3(a) above, if applicable), Series A-1 Issue Price or Series A-2 Issue Price, as the case
may be, of such shares of Series C, Series B-1, Series A-1 or Series A-2 held by each such
holder: provided, that not withstanding any other provision of this Restated Certificate, no such
shares shall be redeemed until all shares for which redemption was previously properly requested
as of an earlier Senior Preferred Redemption Date or Series A Redemption Date have been
redeemed. Following such Series A Redemption Date the Corporation shall use its best efforts to
complete such redemption as promptly as practicable.

4. Conversion.

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Series A-1, Series A-2, Series B-1
and Series C, shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of

-B-

representing shares of Series A-1 is surrendered to the Corporation for conversion pursuant to
this Section 4. The conversion price per share for each share of Series A-1 shall initially be
$0.70183, subject to adjustment after the date of filing of this Restated Certificate as hereinafter

surrendered to the Corporation for conversion pursuant to this Section 4. The conversion price
per share for each share of Series B-1 initially shall be $0.70183, subject to adjustment as
hereinafter provided (the “Series B-1 Conversion Price”). The number of shares of Common
Stock issuable upon the conversion of each share of Series C shall be determined by dividing
$0.76 by the conversion price for the Series C in effect at the time that any certificate

Section 4. The conversion price per share for each share of Series C initially shall be $0.76,

be paid in cash or in Common Stock (valued at its then fair market value as determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors) as elected by the Corporation.

(bv) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Series C and Series B-1
shall be converted automatically into shares of Common Stock at the then applicable conversion

(c) Mechanics of Conversion.

(i) Before any holder of shares of Series A-1, Series A-2,
Series B-1 or Series C shall be entitled to convert such shares into shares of Common Stock,
such holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates representing such shares of Series A-1,
Series A-2, Series B-1 or Series C, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any
transfer agent for such shares of Series A-1, Series A-2, Series B-1 or Series C, and shall give
written notice thereof to the Corporation at such office stating that such holder is electing to
convert such shares of Series A-1, Series A-2, Series B-1 or Series C and further stating the
name or names in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common
Stock issuable upon such conversion to be issued. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable
thereafter, issue and deliver to such holder of shares of Series A-1, Series A-2, Series B-1 or
Series C a certificate or certificates representing the number of shares of Common Stock issuable
upon the conversion of such shares of Series A-1, Series A-2, Series B-1 or Series C. Such
conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the
date of surrender of the certificate or certificates representing the shares of Series A-1, Series A-
2, Series B-1 or Series C to be so converted, and the holder or holders entitled to receive the

such event, the Series A-1 Conversion Price, the Series A-2 Conversion Price, the Series B-1
Conversion Price, and the Series C Conversion Price shall each be reduced, concurrently with
such issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying each such

Common Stock deemed to be outstanding (as defined below) immediately prior to such issuance,
plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration received by the
Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued would
purchase at each such Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance, and the
denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be outstanding
(as defined below) immediately prior to such issuance, plus the number of such Additional
Shares of Common Stock so issued. For the purpose of the above calculation, the number of
shares of Common Stock deemed to be outstanding immediately prior to such issuance shall be
calculated on a fully diluted basis, as if all shares of Preferred Stock and all Convertible
Securities had been fully converted into or exchanged for shares of Common Stock, and any
outstanding Options or any Options reserved for issuance under any stock option or stock
purchase plans or other arrangements on terms approved by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation, had been fully exercised (and the resulting securities fully converted into shares of

the aggregate amount of cash received by the Corporation excluding amounts paid or payable for
accrued interest or declared but unpaid dividends;

; (B) _ insofar as it consists of property other than
cash, be computed at the fair value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith
by the Board of Directors; and

(©) __ in the event Additional Shares of Common
Stock are issued together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for
consideration which covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed
as provided in clauses (A) and (B) above, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors
of the Corporation.

(2) Options and Convertible Securities. The
consideration per share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock

deemed to have been issued pursuant to Section 4(d){iii) hereof relating to Options and
Convertible Securities shall be quotient obtained by dividing:

(A) _ the total amount, if any, received or
receivable by the Corporation as consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible
Securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the
instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein designed to
protect against dilution) payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible
Securities, the exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities; by

(B) The maximum number of shares of
Common Stock (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision
contained therein designed to protect against the dilution) issuable upon the exercise of such

consideration, or shall effect a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a
greater number of shares of Common Stock (by stock split, reclassification or otherwise than by
payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock or in any right to acquire shares of Common
Stock), or in the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined or
consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock,
then the Series A-1, Series A-2, Series B-1, and Series C Conversion Price in effect immediately
prior to such event shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such event, be proportionately
decreased or increased, as appropriate. In the event that the Corporation shall declare or pay,
without consideration, any dividend on or in respect of shares of Common Stock payable in any
right to acquire shares of Common Stock for no consideration, then the Corporation shall be

-14-
deemed to have made a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock in an amount of shares
equal to the maximum number of shares issuable upon exercise of such rights to acquire shares
of Common Stock.

(f) Adjustments for Reclassification and Reorganization. If the shares
- of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of any shares of Series A-1, Series A-2, Series B-1

classes of capital stock of the Corporation, whether by capital reorganization, merger,
reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares provided for in
Section 4(e) hereof or a merger or other reorganization referred to in Section 2(d) hereof), the
Series A-1, Series A-2, Series B-1, and Series C Conversion Price then in effect shall,
concurrently with the effectiveness of such reorganization or reclassification, be proportionately
adjusted so that shares of Series A-1, Series A-2, Series B-1, and Series C shall be convertible
into, in lieu of the number of shares of Common Stock which the holders would otherwise have
been entitled to receive, a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock equivalent to
the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been subject to receipt by the holder,
upon conversion of shares of Series A-1, Series A-2, Series B-1 and Series C immediately before
such change, respectively.

Certificate of Incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation,

sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of Series A-1, Series A-2, Series B-1
or Series C, and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock
shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of Series A-1, Series
