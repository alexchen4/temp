such removal; provided, however, that, unless the entire Board of Directors is removed, no
individual director may be removed when the votes cast against such director’s removal, or not
consenting in writing to such removal, would be sufficient to elect that director if voted
cumulatively at an election which the same total number of votes were cast (or, if such action is
taken by written consent, aJl shares entitled to vote were voted) and the entire number of
directors authorized at the time of such director’s most recent election were then being elected.

(d) Mechanics of Conversion.

(i) Each holder of Series Preferred who desires to convert the
same into shares of Common Stock pursuant to this Section 4 shall surrender the certificate or
certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Company or any transfer agent for the
Series Preferred, and shall give written notice to the Company at such office that such holder
elects to convert the same. Such notice shall state the number of shares of Series Preferred being
converted. Thereupon, the Company shall promptly issue and deliver at such office to such
holder a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled and shall promptly pay (i) in cash or, to the extent sufficient funds are not then
legally available therefor, in Common Stock (at the Common Stock’s fair market value
determined by the Board of Directors as of the date of such conversion), any declared and unpaid
dividends on the shares of Series Preferred being converted and (ii) in cash (at the Common
Stock’s fair market value determined by the Board of Directors in good faith as of the date of
conversion) the value of any fractional share of Common Stock otherwise issuable to any holder
of Series Preferred. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made at the close of business
on the date of such surrender of the certificates representing the shares of Series Preferred to be
converted, and the person entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such
conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such shares of Common Stock
on such date.

(ii) If the conversion is in connection with an underwritten
offering of securities pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ‘‘Act”), the
conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering shares of Series Preferred for conversion,
be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to such
offering, in which event the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock upon conversion of
the Series Preferred shall not be deemed to have converted such Series Preferred until
immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities.

11.
551756 viS/SD
(e) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If at any time or
from time to time after the Filing Date the Company effects a subdivision of the outstanding
Common Stock without a corresponding subdivision of the Preferred Stock, the applicable Series
Preferred Conversion Price in effect immediately before that subdivision shall be proportionately
decreased. Conversely. if at any time or from time to time after the Filing Date the Company
combines the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares without a
corresponding combination of the Preferred Stock, the applicable Series Preferred Conversion
Price in effect immediately before the combination shall be proportionately increased. Any
adjustment under this Section 4(e) shall become effective at the close of business on the date the
subdivision or combination becomes effective.

(f) Adjustment for Common Stock Dividends and Distributions. If at
any time or from time to time after the Filing Date the Company pays a dividend or other
distribution in additional shares of Common Stock, the applicable Series Preferred Conversion
Price that is then in effect shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance, as provided below:

(i) The applicable Scries Preferred Conversion Price shall be
adjusted by multiplying the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price then in effect by a
fraction:

(A) _ the numerator of which is the total number of shares
of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance, and

(B) the denominator of which is the total number of
shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance
plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or
distnibution;

(ii) If the Company fixes a record date to determine which
holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution, the
applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be fixed as of the close of business on such
record date and the number of shares of Common Stock shall be calculated immediately prior to
the close of business on such record date; and

(iii) If such record date is fixed and such dividend is not fully
paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the applicable Series
Preferred Conversion Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such
record date and thereafter the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be adjusted
pursuant to this Section 4(f) to reflect the actual payment of such dividend or distribution.

(g) Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. If at
any time or from time to time after the Filing Date, the Common Stock issuable upon the
conversion of the Series Preferred is changed into the same or a different number of shares of
any class or classes of stock, whether by recapitalization, reclassification or otherwise (other than
an Acquisition or Asset Transfer as defined in Section 3 or a subdivision or combination of
shares or stock dividend or a reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale of assets provided for
elsewhere in this Section 4), in any such event each holder of Series Preferred shall then have the

12.
551756 v15/SD
right to convert such stock into the kind and amount of stock and other securities and property
receivable upon such recapitalization, reclassification or other change equivalent to the
maximum number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series Preferred could
have been converted immediately prior to such recapitalization, reclassification or change, all
subject to further adjustment as provided herein or with respect to such other securities or
property by the terms thereof.

(h) Reorganizations, Mergers or Consolidations. If at any time or
from time to time after the Filing Date, there is a capital reorganization of the Common Stock or
the merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another corporation or another entity or
person (other than an Acquisition or Asset Transfer as defined in Section 3 or a recapitalization,
subdivision, combination, reclassification, exchange or substitution of shares provided for
elsewhere in this Section 4), as a part of such capital reorganization, provision shall be made so
that the holders of Series Preferred shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of the
Series Preferred the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the Company to
which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion would
have been entitled on such capital reorganization, merger or consolidation subject to adjustment
in respect of such stock or securities by the terms thereof. In any such case, appropriate
adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 4 with respect to the
rights of the holders of Series Preferred after the capital reorganization, merger or consolidation
to the end that the provisions of this Section 4 (including adjustment of the applicable Series
Preferred Conversion Price then in effect and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of
the Series Preferred) shall be applicable after that event and be as nearly equivalent as
practicable.

(i) Sale of Shares Below Series D Preferred Conversion Price.

(i) If at any time or from time to time after the Filing Date, the
Company issues or sells, or is deemed by the express provisions of this Section 4(i) to have
issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock (as defined in Section 4(i)(iv) below), other
than as a dividend or other distribution on any class of stock as provided in Section 4(f) above.
and other than a subdivision or combination of shares of Common Stock as provided in Section
4(e) above, for an Effective Price (as defined in Section 4(i)(iv) below) less than the then
effective Series D Preferred Conversion Price, then the then existing Series D Preferred
Conversion Price shall be reduced, as of the opening of business on the date of such issue or sale,
to a price determined by multiplying the Series D Preferred Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such issuance or sale by a fraction (1) the numerator of which shall be (A)
the number of shares of Common Stock deemed outstanding (as defined below) immediately
prior to such issue or sale, plus (B) the number of shares of Common Stock which the Aggregate
Consideration received (as defined in Section 4(i)(ii) below) by the Company for the total
number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued would purchase at such Series D
Preferred Conversion Price, and (2) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Stock deemed outstanding (as defined below) immediately prior to such issue or sale
plus the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued. For the purposes of the
preceding sentence, the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be outstanding as of a
given date shall be the sum of (A) the number of shares of Common Stock actually outstanding
on the day immediately preceding the given datc, (B) the number of shares of Common Stock

13.

551756 vIS/SD
into which the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock could be converted if fully converted
on the day immediately preceding the given date and (C) the number of shares of Common Stock
which could be obtained through the exercise or conversion of all other rights. options, warrants
and convertible securities outstanding on the day immediately proceeding the given date. No
adjustment shall be made to the Series D Preferred Conversion Price in an amount less than one
cent per share. Any adjustment otherwise required by this Section 4(i) that is not required to be
made due to the preceding sentence shall be included in any subsequent adjustment to the Series
D Preferred Conversion Price.

(ii) | For the purpose of making any adjustment required under
this Section 4(i), the aggregate consideration received by the Company for any issue or sale of
securities (the “Aggregate Consideration”) shall be defined as: (A) to the extent it consists of
cash, be computed at the net amount of cash received by the Company after deduction of any
underwriting or similar commissions, compensation or concessions paid or allowed by the
Company in connection with such issue or sale but without deduction of any expenses payable
by the Company, (B) to the extent it consists of property other than cash, be computed at the fair
value of that property as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, and (C) if
Additional Shares of Common Stock, Convertible Securities (as defined in Section 4(i)(iii)
below) or rights or options to purchase either Additional Shares of Common Stock or
Convertible Securities are issued or sold together with other stock or securities or other assets of
the Company for a consideration which covers both, be computed as the portion of the
consideration so received that may be reasonably determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors to be allocable to such Additional Shares of Common Stock, Convertible Securities or
rights or options.

(iii) For the purpose of the adjustment required under this
Section 4(i), if the Company issues or sells (x) stock or other securities convertible into
Additional Shares of Common Stock (such convertible stock or securities being herein referred
to as “Convertible Securities’’) or (y) rights or options for the purchase of Additional Shares of
Common Stock or Convertible Securities and if the Effective Price of such Additional Shares of
Common Stock is less than the Series D Preferred Conversion Price, in each case the Company
shall be deemed to have issued at the time of the issuance of such rights or options or
Convertible Securities the maximum number of Additional Shares of Common Stock issuable
upon exercise or conversion thereof and to have received as consideration for the issuance of
such shares an amount equal to the total amount of the consideration, if any, received by the
Company for the issuance of such rights or options or Convertible Securities plus, (1) in the case
of such rights or options, the minimum amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Company
upon the exercise of such rights or options, plus, (2) in the case of Convertible Securities, the
minimum amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon the conversion thereof
(other than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities);
provided that if the minimum amounts of such consideration cannot be ascertained, but are a
function of antidilution or similar protective clauses, the Company shall be deemed to have
received the minimum amounts of consideration without reference to such clauses; provided
further (3) that if the minimum amount of consideration payable to the Company upon the
exercise or conversion of rights, options or Convertible Securities is reduced over time or on the
occurrence or non-occurrence of specified events other than by reason of antidilution
adjustments, the Effective Price shall be recalculated using the figure to which such minimum

14,
551756 v15/SD
amount of consideration is reduced; provided further, that if the minimum amount of
consideration payable to the Company upon the exercise or conversion of such rights, options or
Convertible Securities is subsequently increased, the Effective Price shal) be again recalculated
using the increased minimum amount of consideration payable to the Company upon the
exercise or conversion of such rights, options or Convertible Securities (provided, however, no
such adjustment of the Series D Preferred Conversion Price shall affect the Common Stock
previously issued upon conversion of such series of Preferred Stock). No further adjustment of
the Series D Preferred Conversion Price, as adjusted upon the issuance of such rights, options or
Convertible Securities, shall be made as a result of the actual issuance of Additional Shares of
Common Stock or the exercise of any such rights or options or the conversion of any such
Convertible Securities. If any such rights or options or the conversion privilege represented by
any such Convertible Securities shall expire without having been exercised, the Scries D
Preferred Conversion Price as adjusted upon the issuance of such rights, options or Convertible
Securities shall be readjusted to the Series D Preferred Conversion Price which would have been
in effect had an adjustment been made on the basis that the only Additional Shares of Common
Stock so issued were the Additional Shares of Common Stock, if any, actually issued or sold on
the exercise of such rights or options or rights of conversion of such Convertible Securities, and
such Additional] Shares of Common Stock, if any, were issued or sold for the consideration
actually received by the Company upon such exercise, plus the consideration, if any, actually
received by the Company for the granting of all such rights or options, whether or not exercised,
plus the consideration received for issuing or selling the Convertible Securities actually
converted. plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the Company (other than by
cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities) on the
conversion of such Convertible Securities, provided that such readjustment shall not apply to
prior conversions of Series Preferred. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Additional Shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of Convertible Securities and
exercise of rights or options for the purchase of Additional Shares of Common Stock or
Convertible Securitics, including but not limited to convertible promissory notes and warrants,
shall not be deemed to have been issued or sold by the Company under this Section 4(i), until
such date the Effective Price of such Additional Shares of Common Stock underlying such
Convertible Securities or rights or options for the purchase of Additional Shares of Common
Stock or Convertible Securities is ascertainable.

(iv) | For the purpose of making any adjustment to the Series D
Preferred Conversion Price required under this Section 4(i), “Additional Shares of Common
Stock” shall mean all shares of Common Stock issued by the Company or deemed to be issued
pursuant to this Section 4(i) (including shares of Common Stock subsequently reacquired or
retired by the Company), other than (1) shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of then
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock; (2) (x) before the occurrence of the Subsequent Closing

(1,119,500) shares of Common Stock and/or options, warrants or other Common Stock purchase

thousand four hundred sixty-two (1,538,462) shares of Series C-2 Preferred issued pursuant to

the subsections of this clause (iv) above shall mean all shares of Common Stock issued by the
Company or deemed to be issued pursuant to this Section 4(i). The “Effective Price” of
Additional Shares of Common Stock shall mean the quotient determined by dividing the total
number of Additional Shares of Common Stock issued or sold, or deemed to have been issued or
sold by the Company under this Section 4(i), into the Aggregate Consideration received, or

Additional Shares of Common Stock.

compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the provisions hereof and prepare a
certificate showing such adjustment or readjustment, and shall mail such certificate, by first class
mail, postage prepaid, to each registered holder of Series Preferred at the holder’s address as

() Automatic Conversion.

(i) Each share of Series Preferred shall automatically be
converted into shares of Common Stock, based on the then-effective applicable Series Preferred
Conversion Price, (A) immediately upon the closing of a firmly underwnitten public offering
pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
covering the offer and sale of Common Stock for the account of the Company in which (y) if
such closing occurs on or prior to the second anniversary of the Filing Date, (i) the per share
price is at least $10.12 (as adjusted for stock splits, dividends, recapitalizations and the like after

discounts, commissions and fees) are at least $50,000,000, or (z) if such closing occurs after the
second anniversary of the Filing Date, (i) the per share price is at least $15.18 (as adjusted for
stock splits, dividends, recapitalizations and the like after the Filing Date), and (ii) the net cash
proceeds to the Company (after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and fees) are at
least $50,000,000 (a “Qualifying Public Offering’) or (B) the date upon which the Company
consummates an Acquisition or Asset Transfer in which (y) if such Acquisition or Asset Transfer
is completed on or prior to the second anniversary of the Filing Date, the Effective Per Share
Sale Price (as defined below) in such Acquisition or Asset Transfer is not less than $10.12 (as
adjusted for stock splits, dividends, recapitalizations and the like after the Filing Date) or (z) if
such Acquisition or Asset Transfer is completed after the second anniversary of the Filing Date,
the Effective Per Share Sale Price in such Acquisition or Asset Transfer is not less than $15.18
(as adjusted for stock splits, dividends, recapitalizations and the like after the Filing Date). Upon
such automatic conversion, any declared and unpaid dividends shall be paid in accordance with
the provisions of Section 4(d). For purposes of this Section, the “Effective Per Share Sale
Price” with respect to any Acquisition or Asset Transfer shall be the quotient of (1) the value of
the aggregate consideration received or to be received by the Company in respect of such
Acquisition or Asset Transfer (determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, with any
securities and other non-cash consideration valued in accordance with Section 3(f)(iii) above and
the value of any future or contingent payments determined on an expected net present value
basis), divided by (2) the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be outstanding

(determined in accordance with Section 4(i)(i) above) on the date of closing of the Acquisition or
Asset Transfer.

(ii) Upon the occurrence of any of the events specified in
Section 4(1)(i) above, the outstanding shares of applicable Series Preferred shall be converted
automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the

17.
551756 v1S/SD
certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Company or its transfer agent:
provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion unless the certificates evidencing such
shares of Series Preferred are cither delivered to the Company or its transfer agent as provided
below, or the holder notifies the Company or its transfer agent that such certificates have been
lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement reasonably satisfactory to the Company to
indemnify the Company from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates. Upon
the occurrence of such automatic conversion of the Series Preferred, the holders of Series
Preferred shall surrender the certificates representing such shares at the office of the Company or
any transfer agent for the Series Preferred. Thereupon, there shal] be issued and delivered to

conversion occurred, and any declared and unpaid dividends shall be paid in accordance with the
provisions of Section 4(d).

(m) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall
be issued upon conversion of Series Preferred. All shares of Common Stock (including fractions
thereof) issuable upon conversion of more than one share of Series Preferred by a holder thereof
shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the conversion would result in the
issuance of any fractional share. If, after the aforementioned aggregation, the conversion would
result in the issuance of any fractional share, the Company shall, in lieu of issuing any fractional
share, pay cash equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by the Common Stock’s fair
market value (as determined by the Board of Directors in good faith) on the date of conversion.

shal] at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common
Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Series Preferred,
such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding shares of the Series Preferred. If at any time the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all then outstanding shares of the Series Preferred, the Company will take such corporate
action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.

(0) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Section 4
shall be in writing and shall] be deemed effectively given: (i) upon personal delivery to the party
to be notified, (ii) when sent by confirmed electronic mail or facsimile if sent during normal
business hours of the recipient; if not, then on the next business day, (iii) five (5) days after
having been sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or (iv)
one (1) day after deposit with a nationally recognized overnight courier, specifying next day
delivery, with verification of receipt. All notices shall be addressed to each holder of record at
the address of such holder appearing on the books of the Company.

(p) Payment of Taxes. The Company will pay all taxes (other than
taxes based upon income) and other governmental charges that may be imposed with respect to
the issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of shares of Series Preferred,

18.
551756 viS/SD
excluding any tax or other charge imposed in connection with any transfer involved in the issue
and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in which the shares of Series
Preferred so converted were registered.

(q) No Impairment. The Company will not, by amendment of its
Certificate of Incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation,
merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to
avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder
by the Company, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions
of this Section 4 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order
to protect the conversion rights of the holders of Series Preferred against impairment.

5. REDEMPTION.

(a) The Company shall be obligated to redeem the Series Preferred as
follows:

(i) At any time after the fifth anniversary after the Filing Date,
the holders of at least sixty-seven percent (67%) of the then outstanding shares of Series D
Preferred may require the Company, to the extent it may lawfully do so, to redeem all of the
outstanding Series D Preferred in twelve equal quarterly installments (each a “Series D
Redemption Date’), provided that the Company shall receive at least 60 days prior to the first
Series D Redemption Date written notice of such consent of the Series D Preferred. The
Company shall effect such redemptions on the applicable Series D Redemption Date by paying
in cash in exchange for the shares of Series D Preferred to be redeemed a sum equal to (i) the
Original Issue Price of the Series D Preferred (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations,
splits, recapitalizations and the like after the Filing Date), plus (ii) any declared and unpaid
dividends with respect to such shares. The total amount to be paid for Series D Preferred
pursuant to this Section 5(a)(i) is hereinafter referred to as the “Series D Redemption Price.” The
number of shares of Series D Preferred that the Company shall be required to redeem on any one
Series D Redemption Date shall be equal to the amount determined by dividing (A) the
aggregate number of shares of Series D Preferred outstanding immediately prior to the Series D
Redemption Date by (B) the number of remaining Series D Redemption Dates (including the
Series D Redemption Date to which such calculation applies). Shares subject to redemption
pursuant to this Section 5(a)(i) shall be redeemed from each holder of Series D Preferred on a
pro rata basis based on the number of shares of Series D Preferred held by such holder in
proportion to the aggregate number of shares of outstanding Series D Preferred.

(ii) | At any time after the complete redemption of al] of the
outstanding shares of Series D Preferred in accordance with Section 5(a)(i) hereof, the holders of
at least sixty-seven percent (67%) of the then outstanding shares of Series C Preferred and Series
C-2 Preferred, voting together as a single class, may require the Company, to the extent it may
lawfully do so, to redeem all of the outstanding Series C Preferred and Series C-2 Preferred in
twelve equal quarterly installments (each a “Series C/C-2 Redemption Date” and, together with
the Series D Redemption Date, the “Redemption Date’’); provided that the Company shal]
receive at least 60 days prior to the first Series C/C-2 Redemption Date written notice of such
consent of the Series C Preferred and Series C-2 Preferred. The Company shall effect such

19.
551756 vi5/SD
redemptions on the applicable Series C/C-2 Redemption Date by paying in cash in exchange for
the shares of Series C Preferred and Series C-2 Preferred to be redeemed a sum equal to (i) the
Original Issue Price of the Series C Preferred and Series C-2 Preferred, respectively (as adjusted
for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like after the Filing Date),
plus (ii) any declared and unpaid dividends with respect to such shares. The total amount to be

redemption of shares thereafter converted into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 4
hereof no later than the fifth day preceding the applicable Redemption Date shall be returned to
the Company forthwith upon such conversion. The balance of any funds deposited by the
Company pursuant to this Section 5(b) remaining unclaimed at the expiration of one year
following such Redemption Date shall be returned to the Company promptly upon its written
request.

(c) On or after any Redemption Date, each holder of shares to be
redeemed upon such Redemption Date shall surrender such holder’s certificates representing
such shares to the Company in the manner and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice,
and thereupon the Redemption Price of such shares shall be payable to the order of the person

certificate shall be canceled. In the event less than all the shares represented by such certificates

after such Redemption Date, unless there shall have been a default in payment of the Redemption
Price or the Company is unable to pay the Redemption Price due to not having sufficient legally
available funds, all rights and preferences of the holder provided herein (except the right to
receive the applicable Redemption Price without interest upon surrender of certificates for such
shares) shall cease and terminate with respect to such shares; provided that in the event that such
shares are not redeemed due to a default in payment by the Company or because the Company
does not have sufficient legally available funds, such shares shall remain outstanding and shall
be entitled to all of the rights and preferences provided herein.

Preferred and Series C-2 Preferred or Series D Preferred, the Conversion Rights (as defined in
Section 4) for such shares of Series C Preferred and Series C-2 Preferred or Series D Preferred
shall terminate as to the shares designated for redemption at the close of business on the fifth day
preceding the applicable Redemption Date, unless default is made in payment of the applicable
Redemption Price.
