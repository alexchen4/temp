the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share and on or
prior to the fifth day prior to the Redemption Date, if any, as may have been fixed in any
Redemption Notice with respect to the Preferred Stock, at the office of the Corporation or any
transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Original Issue Price for such series of Preferred
Stock by the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock, determined as hereinafter
provided, in effect at the time of the conversion (the “Conversion Rate”). The initial ‘Series A
Conversion Price” per share for the Series A Preferred Stock shall be $1.00 and the initial

A.

AU 163499 2
355680-900000
Series A Conversion Price and Series B Conversion Price are sometimes referred to herein
respectively as the “Conversion Price.” Such initial Conversion Price for each series of
Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment as provided in subsection (D) of this Section 4.3.

(2) ‘Holders of Preferred Stock agree to be bound by the provisions
-contractually- obligating their conversion of their Preferred Stock upon certain conditidns
‘pursuant to Section 2.4 of that certain Investors’ Rights Agreement, as amended, entered into in
connection with the purchase of Preferred Stock. Should such provisions mandate conversion
under Section 4.3(A)(1) above, the converting holder shall not be entitled to accrued dividends
payable under Section 4.1 above on the Preferred Stock.

(B) Automatic Conversion. Each share of each series of Preferred Stock shall
automatically be converted into fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock at its then
effective Conversion Rate upon the earlier of (i) immediately prior to the closing of a firm
commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), covering the offer and sale of
Common Stock to the public for the account of the Corporation in which the public offering
price (prior to underwriter’s discounts or commissions and offering expenses) exceeds $2.20 per
share of Common Stock (as adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split or combination with
respect to such share) and the aggregate gross proceeds raised exceeds $25,000,000 (a “Qualified
IPO”) or (ii) the date specified by written consent or agreement of the holders of at least the
Designated Percentage of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock.

(C) Mechanics of Conversion.

(1) Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert
the same into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates
therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for such
Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the Corporation at such office that such holder
elects to convert the same and shall state therein the name or names in which such holder wishes
the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued. The Corporation shall, as
soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, a
certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall
be entitled as aforesaid. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately pnor
to the close of business on the date of surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted,
and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such
conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of
Common Stock on such date; provided, however, that in the event of an automatic conversion
pursuant to Section 4.3(B) above, the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted
automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the
certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent;
provided further, however, that the Corporation shal] not be obligated to issue certificates
evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such automatic conversion unless the
certificates evidencing such sharcs of Preferred Stock are either delivered to the Corporation or
its transfer agent as provided above.

AU 163499.2
355680-900000
(2) If the conversion is in connection with a Qualified IPO, the
conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering shares of Preferred Stock for conversion,
be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to such
offering, in which event the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock upon conversion of
the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until
immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities.

(D) Adjustment of Conversion Price. The Conversion Price for each series of
Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

(1) (a If the Corporation shall issue, after the date of filing of this

Restated Certificate, any Additional Stock (as defined in subsection (D)(2)) without
consideration or for a consideration per share less than the respective Conversion Price for any
series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock, the
respective Conversion Price for such series in effect immediately prior to each such issuance of
Additional Stock shall forthwith (except as otherwise provided in this subsection (D)) be
adjusted to a price equal to (calculated to the nearest cent) the product obtained by multiplying
the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such:
issuance.of Additional Stock by a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the sum of (x) the
total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any shares of Common Stock
deemed to be issued pursuant to subsection (D)(1)(€)() or (ii) of this Section 4,3) immediately
the aggregate consideration received by this Corporation for such issuance of Additional Stock ~
would purchase at the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately
prior to such issuance of Additional Stock, and the denominator of which is equal.to the sum of
(x) the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any shares of Common’
Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to subsection (D)(1)(e){i) or (ii) of this Section 4,3)
immediately prior to such issuance of Additional Stock plus (y) the number of shares of
Additional Stock issued. For purposes of adjusting the Conversion Price of a series of Preferred
Stock, the issuance of Additional Stock consisting of the same series or class at the same price at
two (2) or more related closings held within a six (6) month period shall be aggregated and
treated as one issuance of Additional Stock occurring on the first date on which such Additional
Stock was issued.

(b) No adjustment in the Conversion Price for any series of
Preferred Stock need be made if such adjustment would result in a change in the Conversion
Price of less than $0.01. Any adjustment of less than $0.01 that is not made shall be carried
forward and shall be made at the time of and together with any subsequent adjustment that, on a
cumulative basis, amounts to an adjustment of $0.01 or more in the Conversion Price. Except to
the limited extent provided for in subsections (D)(1)(e){ili) or (iv), no adjustment of the
Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock pursuant to this subsection (D)(1) shall have
the effect of increasing any such Conversion Price above the Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such adjustment.

(c) In the case of the issuance of Additional Stock for cash, the
consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting any

6-
AU'A105699,2
355680-900000
discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the Corporation for any
underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

(d) ‘In the case of the issuance of Additional Stock for a
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shal] be
deemed to be the fair value thereof as determined in good faith by the Corporation's Board of
Directors irrespective of any accounting treatment.

(e) In the case of the issuance (whether before, on or after the
date of filing of this Restated Certificate) of (i) options to purchase or rights to subscribe for
Common Stock, (ii) securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for Common
Stock or (iii) options to purchase or rights to subscribe for securities by their terms convertible
into or exchangeable for Common Stock, the following provisions shall apply for all purposes of
subsections (D)(1) and (2):

(i) The aggregate maximum number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable upon exercise (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to
exercisability, including without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account
potential antidilution adjustments) of such options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common
Stock shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such options or nights were issued and for
a consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in subsections
(D)(1(c) and (D)(1)(d)), if any, received by the Corporation upon the issuance of such options or
rights plus the minimum exercise price provided in such options or rights (without taking into
account potential antidilution adjustments) for the Common Stock covered thereby.

(ii) The aggregate maximum number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of or in exchange (assuming the satisfaction of any
conditions to convertibility or exchangeability, including without limitation, the passage of time,
but without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) for any such convertible or
exchangeable securities or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for
such convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof shall
be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or such options or rights
were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration, if any, received by the
Corporation for any such securities and related options or nghts (excluding any cash received on
account of accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the minimum additional consideration, if
any, to be received by the Corporation (without taking into account potential antidilution
adjustments) upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or the exercise of any related
options or rights (the consideration in each case to be determined in the manner provided in
subsections (D)(1)(c) and (D)(1)(d)).

(iii) In the event of any change in the number of shares
of Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to this Corporation upon exercise
of such options or rights or upon conversion of or exchange for such convertible or exchangeable
securities, including, but not limited to, a change resulting from the antidilution provisions
thereof, the Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected
by or computed using such options, rights or securities, shall be recomputed to reflect such
change, but no further adjustment shall be made for the actual issuance of Common Stock or any

payment of such consideration upon the exercise of any such options or rights or the conversion
or exchange of such securities.

rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Conversion Price for each series

securities or options or rights related to such securities, shal] be recomputed to reflect the
issuance of only the number of shares of Common Stock (and convertible or exchangeable
securities that remain in effect) actually issued upon the excrcise of such options or rights, upon
the conversion or exchange of such securities or upon the exercise of the options or rights related
to such securities.

(v) The number of shares of Common Stock deemed

payable in additional shares of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents without payment
of any consideration by such holder for the additional shares of Common Stock or the Common
Stock Equivalents (including the additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion
or exercise thercof), then, as of such record date (or the date of such dividend distribution, split

conversion of each share of such series shall be increased in proportion to such increase of the
aggregate of shares of Common Stock outstanding and those issuable with respect to such
Common Stock Equivalents.

(4) Combination. If the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding at any time after the date of filing of this Restated Certificate is decreased by a
combination of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, then, on the effective date of such
combination, the Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock shall be appropriatcly
increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of any shares of
Preferred Stock shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares.

be made so that the holders of each series of Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to
receive upon conversion of each such series of Preferred Stock the number of shares of stock or
other securities or property of the Corporation or otherwise, to which a holder of Common Stock
delivcrable upon conversion of such series of Preferred Stock would have been entitled on such
recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the

fraction multiplied by the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date of
conversion as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. Whether or not fractional
shares are issuable upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of
shares of Preferred Stock the holder is at the time converting into Common Stock and the
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such aggregate conversion.

(2) Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the
Conversion Rate for any series of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4.3, the Corporation,
at its expense, shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the

conversion of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of

necessary amendment to this Restated Certificate.

4.4 Redemption.

(A) At any time after December 17, 2010, but within forty-five (45) days after
the receipt by this Corporation of a written request from the holders of at least the Designated
Percentage of the then outstanding shares of any series of Preferred Stock, that all or, if less than
all, a specified percentage of such holders’ shares of such series of Preferred Stock be redeemed,
and concurrently with surrender by such holders of the certificates representing such shares, this
Corporation shall, to the extent it may lawfully do so, redeem in two (2) annual installments
(each payment date being referred to herein as a “Redemption Date”) the shares specified in such
request by paying in cash therefor an amount per share equal to the greater of (i) the Series A
Original Issue Price or Series B Original Issue Price, as the case may be, or (ii) the fair market
value of the Scries A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, as the case may be, as
determined in good faith by the Corporation’s Board of Directors irrespective of any accounting
treatment and on a going concer basis to the extent the Corporation is not in the process of
liquidation or winding up its business and affairs at the time of such valuation, in each case, plus
an additional amount equal to any dividends declared or accrued but unpaid on each such share
(the ‘Redemption Price”). The number of shares of Preferred Stock that this Corporation shal]
be required to redeem on each Redemption Date shall be equal to the amount determined by
dividing (i) the aggregate number of shares of each series of Preferred Stock outstanding
immediately prior to any such Redemption Date that have been requested to be redeemed
pursuant to this subsection (A) by (ii) the number of remaining Redemption Dates (including the
Redemption Date to which such calculation applies). Any redemption effected pursuant to this
Section 4.4 shall be made on a pro rata basis among the holders of Preferred Stock to be
redeemed in proportion to the number of shares of such affected series of Preferred Stock then
held by such holders.

(B) Redemption Procedure. As used in this subsection(B) and in
subsections (C) and (D) below, the term “Redemption Price” shall refer to the respective
Redemption Price (for either Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, as the case
may be). At least twenty (20) days prior to each Redemption Date, written notice (the
‘Redemption Notice”) shall be mailed, postage prepaid, to each holder of record (at the close of
business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given) of the Preferred
Stock to be redeemed, at the address last shown on the records of the Corporation for such holder
or given by the holder to the Corporation for the purpose of notice or if no such address appears
or is given, at the place where the principal executive office of the Corporation is located,
notifying such holder of the redemption to be effected, specifying the number of shares to be
redeemed from such holder, the Redemption Price, the place at which payment may be obtained
and calling upon such holder to surrender to the Corporation, in the manner and at the place
designated, its certificate or certificates representing the shares to be redeemed. Except as
provided in subsection (C) below, on or after each Redemption Date, each holder of Preferred
Stock to be redcemed shall surrender to the Corporation the certificate or certificates
representing such shares, in the manner and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice,
and thereupon the aggregate Redemption Price of such shares shall be payable to the order of the
person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof and each
surrendered certificate shall be cancelled. In the event less than all the shares represented by any
such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed
shares.

(C) Effect of Redemption. From and after each Redemption Date, unless there
shall have been a default in payment of the Redemption Price, all rights of the holders of the
shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed on a Redemption Date (except the right to receive their
respective Redemption Price without interest upon surrender of their certificate or certificates)
shall cease with respect to such shares, and such shares shall not thereafter be transferred on the
books of the Corporation or be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose whatsoever. If the
funds of the Corporation legally available for redemption on any Redemption Date are
insufficient to redeem the total number of shares requested to be redeemcd on such date, those
funds which are legally available will be used to redeem the maximum possible number of such
shares ratably among the holders of such shares to be redeemed based upon their holdings of
Preferred Stock. The shares not redeemed shal] remain outstanding and be entitled to all the
rights and preferences provided herein. At any time thereafter when additional funds of the
Corporation are legally available for the redemption of shares not redeemed, such funds will
immediately be set aside for the redemption of the balance of the shares which the Corporation
has become obligated to redeem on any Redemption Date but which it has not redeemed.

(D) Redemption Funding. On or prior to each Redemption Date, the
Corporation shall deposit the Redemption Price of all shares of Preferred Stock designated for
redemption in the Redemption Notice, and not yet redeemed or converted, with a bank or trust
company having aggregate capital and surplus in excess of $100,000,000 as a trust fund for the
benefit of the respective holders of the shares designated for redemption and not yet redeemed.
Simultaneously, the Corporation shall deposit irrevocable instructions and authority to such bank
or trust company to pay, on and after the date fixed for redemption or prior thereto, the
Redemption Price of the Preferred Stock to the holders thereof, upon receipt of notification from
the Corporation that such holder has surrendered such holder’s certificates pursuant to

-12-

AUM163499.2
355680-900000

subsection (B) above. Any money deposited by the Corporation pursuant to this subsection (D)
for the redemption of shares which are thcrcafter converted into shares of Common Stock no
later than the close of business on the last business day prior to the Redemption Date shall be
retumed to the Corporation forthwith upon such conversion. The balance of any money
deposited by the Corporation pursuant to this subsection (D) remaining unclaimed at the
expiration of six months following the applicable Redemption Date shall thereafter be retumed
to the Corporation, provided that the stockholder to which such money would be payable
hereunder shall be entitled, upon proof of its ownership of the Preferred Stock and payment of
any bond requested by the Corporation, to receive such monies but without interest from the
Redemption Date.

taken or any written consent of stockholders is solicited, (ii) shall have voting nghts and powers
