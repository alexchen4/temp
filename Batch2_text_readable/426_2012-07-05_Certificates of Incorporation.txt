(c) Mechanics of Conversion, Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock, he, she or it shall surrender the
certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of this Corporation or of any
transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to this Corporation at its

{01615459;3} 10
principal corporate office, of the election to convert the same and shall state therein the name or
names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued, This
Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such
holder of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as
aforesaid. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of
business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the
person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion
shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock
as of such date. If the conversion is in connection with an underwritten offering of securities
registered pursuant to the Act, the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering
Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale
of securities pursuant to such offering, in which event the persons entitled to receive the
Common Stock upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted
such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities.

(d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock. The Conversion Prices
of the Series D Preferred Stock, Series C-1 Preferred Stock, Series B-1 Preferred Stock and

Series A Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

(i) (A) If this Corporation shall issue, after the date hereof (the
“Purchase Date”), any Additional Stock (as defined below) without consideration or for a
consideration per share less than the Conversion Price for a particular series of Preferred Stock in
effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock, the Conversion Price for such
series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall forthwith (except
as otherwise provided in this Section IV(B)(4)(d)(i)) be adjusted to a price determined by
multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding and deemed issued pursuant to Section IV(B)(4)(d)(i)(E)
immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the
aggregate consideration received by this Corporation for such issuance would purchase at such
Conversion Price; and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding and deemed issued pursuant to Section IV(B)(4)(d)(@)(E) immediately prior to such
issuance plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock.

(B) No adjustment of the Conversion Price for any series of Preferred

Stock shall be made in an amount less than one cent per share, provided that any
adjustments that are not required to be made by reason of this sentence shall be carried
forward and shall be either taken into account in any subsequent adjustment made prior to
three (3) years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried

‘forward, or shall be made at the end of three (3) years from the date of the event giving
rise to the adjustment being carried forward. Except to the limited extent provided for in
Sections IV(B)(4)(d4)(i)(E)G) and IV(B)(4)(d)D(E\(4), no adjustment of such Conversion
Price pursuant to this Section IV(B)(4)(d)(i) shall have the effect of increasing the
Conversion Price above the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such
adjustment.

{01615459;3} 1]
(C) In the case of the issuance of Additional Stock for cash, the
consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting
any reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by
this Corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and
sale thereof.

(D) In the case of the issuance of the Additional Stock for a
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall
be deemed to be the fair value thereof as determined by the Board of Directors
irrespective of any accounting treatment.

(E) _ Inthe case of the issuance (whether before, on or after the
applicable Purchase Date) of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common
Stock, securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock or
options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or exchangeable securities,
the following provisions shall apply for all purposes of this Section I1V(B)(4)(d)(i) and
Section IV(B)(4)(d)(id):

(1) The aggregate maximum number of shares of Common
Stock deliverable upon exercise (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to
exercisability, including, without limitation, the passage of time) of such options to
purchase or rights to subscribe for Common Stock shall be deemed to have been issued at
the time such options or rights were issued and for a consideration equal to the
consideration (determined in the manner provided in Sections [V(B)(4)(d)(i)(C) and
TV(B)(4)(d)(i)(D)), if any, received by this Corporation upon the issuance of such options
or rights plus the minimum exercise price provided in such options or rights for the
Common Stock covered thereby.

(2) The aggregate maximum number of shares of Common
Stock deliverable upon conversion of, or in exchange (assuming the satisfaction of any
conditions to exercisability, including, without limitation, the passage of time) for any
such convertible or exchangeable securities or upon the exercise of options to purchase or
rights to subscribe for such convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent
conversion or exchange thereof shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such
securities were issued or such options or rights were issued and for a consideration equal
to the consideration, if any, received by this Corporation for any such securities and
related options or rights (excluding any cash received on account of accrued interest or
accrued dividends), plus the minimum additional consideration, if any, to be received by
this Corporation upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or the exercise of
any related options or rights (the consideration in each case to be determined in the
manner provided in Sections 1V(B)(4)(d)(i)(C) and IV(B)(4)(d)(i)(D)).

(3) In the event of any change in the number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to this Corporation upon
exercise of such options or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such
convertible or exchangeable securities, including, but not limited to, a change resulting
from the antidilution provisions thereof, the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred

{016154593} 12
Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, rights or
securities, shall be recomputed to reflect such change, but no further adjustment shall be
made for the actual issuance of Common Stock or any payment of such consideration
upon the exercise of any such options or rights or the conversion or exchange of such
securities.

(4) | Upon the expiration of any such options or rights, the
termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options or
rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Conversion Price of each
series of Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such
options, rights or securities or options or rights related to such securities, shall be
recomputed to reflect the issuance of only the number of shares of Common Stock (and
convertible or exchangeable securities that remain in effect) actually issued upon the
exercise of such options or rights, upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or
upon the exercise of the options or rights related to such securities.

(5) | The number of shares of Common Stock deemed issued
and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to Sections 1V(B)(4)(d)(i)(E)(1) and
IV(B)(4)(d)()(E)(2) shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or
expiration of the type described in either Section TV(B)(4)(d)(i)(E)(3) or

IV(B)A4AOENA).

issued (or deemed to have been issued pursuant to Section IV(B)(4)(d)(D(E)) by this

outstanding shares of Preferred Stock and (II) approved by the Board of Directors unless
such issuance exceeds the number of shares currently authorized under existing stock
option plans or restricted stock purchase plans;

of the Qualified Public Offering;

(D) _ shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to the conversion or
exercise of convertible or exercisable securities outstanding as of the date hereof;

(E) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable in connection with a
bona fide business acquisition of or by this Corporation, whether by merger,

(03615459;3} 13

shares, issued or issuable to persons or entities with which this Corporation has business
relationships, provided such issuances are for other than primarily equity financing
purposes and (ii) shares of Common Stock, in any amount, issued or issuable to persons
or entities with which this Corporation has business relationships, provided such
issuances are for other than primarily equity financing purposes, so long as such
issuances (in excess of 200,000 shares) have been unanimously approved by the Board of
Directors of this Corporation and the holders of at least eighty-five percent (85%) until
the Second Closing, and after the Second Closing seventy-five percent (75%), of the then
outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock voting separately as a single class; or

(G) _ shares of Common Stock issued or issuable in connection with any
transaction where such securities so issued are excepted from the definition “Additional

time after the applicable Purchase Date fix a record date for the effectuation of a split or
subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or the determination of holders of
Common Stock entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of
Common Stock or.other securities or rights convertible into, or entitling the holder thereof to
receive directly or indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock (hereinafter referred to as
“Common Stock Equivalents”) without payment of any consideration by such holder for the
additional shares of Common Stock or the Common Stock Equivalents (including the additional
shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof), then, as of such record
date (or the date of such dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no record date is fixed), the
Conversion Prices of each series of Preferred Stock shall be appropriately decreased so that the
number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be
increased in proportion to such increase in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding and those issuable with respect to such Common Stock Equivalents.

(iv) | If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any time
after the applicable Purchase Date is decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock, then, following the record date of such combination, the Conversion Prices for
each series of Preferred Stock shall be appropriately increased so that the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be decreased in
proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares.

(e) Other Distributions, In the event this Corporation shall declare a
distribution payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by this
Corporation or other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred
to in Section ITV(B)(4)(d)(iii), then, in each such case for the purpose of this Section IV(B)(4)(e),
the holders of each series of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any such
distribution as though they were the holders of the number of shares of Common Stock of this
Corporation into which their shares of such series of Preferred Stock are convertible as of the
record date fixed for the determination of the holders of Common Stock of this Corporation
entitled to receive such distribution.

{O1615459;3} 14

recapitalization of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision, combination or merger or sale
of assets transaction provided for elsewhere in Section IV(B)(2) or this Section IV(B)(4))
provision shall be made so that the holders of each series of the Preferred Stock shall thereafter
be entitled to receive upon conversion of such series of Preferred Stock the number of shares of
stock or other securities or property of this Corporation or otherwise, to which a holder of the
number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock held by
such holder would have been entitled on such recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate
adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section IV(B)(4) with
respect to the rights of the holders of each series of Preferred Stock after the recapitalization to
the end that the provisions of this Section IV(B)(4) (including adjustment of the Conversion
Price then in effect and the number of shares purchasable upon conversion of each such series of
Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event as nearly equivalent as may be practicable.

(g) | Nolmpairment. This Corporation will not, by amendment of this Eighth
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or through any reorganization,
recapitalization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities
or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the

all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the Conversion Rights of
the holders of Preferred Stock against impairment.

(h) No Fractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments.

(i) No fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of any
share or shares of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would
otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the then
fair market value of a share of Common Stock as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors, The number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon such conversion shall be
determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock the holder is at the time
converting into Common Stock and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such
aggregate conversion.

Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section IV(B){4), this
Corporation, at its expense, shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in
accordance with the terms hereof and prepare and furnish to each holder of such series of
Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail

written request at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to
such holder a like certificate setting forth (A) such adjustment and readjustment, (B) the
