(d}) Reorganization. For purposes of this Section 3, a liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation shall be deemed to be occasioned by, or to include, (a) the acquisition
of the Corporation by another entity by means of any transaction or series of related transactions to
which the Corporation is party (including, without limitation, any stock acquisition, reorganization,
merger or consolidation but excluding any sale of stock for capital raising purposes) other than a
transaction or series of transactions in which the holders of the voting securities of the Corporation
outstanding immediately prior to such transaction continue to retain (either by such voting securities
remaining outstanding or by such voting securities being converted into or exchanged for voting
securities of the surviving entity), as a result of shares in the Corporation held by such holders prior
to such transaction, at least fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power represented by the voting
securities of the Corporation or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such transaction
or series of transactions; (b) a sale, Jease or other conveyance of al! or substantially all of the assets
of the Corporation; or (c) any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, whether
voluntary or involuntary.

(e) Valuation of Non-Cash Consideration. If any assets of the Corporation
distributed to stockholders in connection with any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the
Corporation are other than cash, then the value of such assets shall be their fair market value as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, except that any publicly-traded securities to be
distributed to stockholders in a liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation shall be
valued as follows:

(i) If the securities are then traded on a national securities exchange or the
Nasdaq Stock Market (or a similar national quotation system), then the value of the securities shall
be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange or system over
the ten (10) trading day period ending five (5) trading days prior to the Distribution;

(ii) if the securities are actively traded over-the-counter, then the value of
the securities shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid prices of the securities over the ten
(10) trading day period ending five (5) trading days prior to the Distribution.

In the event of a merger or other acquisition of the Corporation or of all or substantially all of
its assets by another entity, the Distribution date shall be deemed to be the date such transaction
closes.

For the purposes of this subsection 3(e), “trading day” shall mean any day which the
exchange or system on which the securities to be distributed are traded is open and “closing prices”
or “closing bid prices” shall be deemed to be: (i) for securities traded primarily on the New York
Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, the last reported trade price or sale price,
as the case may be, at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on that day and (ii) for securities listed or traded on
other exchanges, markets and systems, the market price as of the end of the regular hours trading
period that is generally accepted as such for such exchange, market or system. If, after the date
hereof, the benchmark times generally accepted in the securities industry for determining the market
price of a stock as of a given trading day shall change from those set forth above, the fair market
value shall be determined as of such other generally accepted benchmark times.

4. Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as
follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the
option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share at the office of the
Corporation or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, into that number of fully-paid,
nonassessable shares of Common Stock determined by dividing the Original Issue Price for the
relevant series by the Conversion Price for such series, (The number of shares of Common Stock
into which each share of Preferred Stock of a series may be converted is hereinafter referred to as the
“Conversion Rate” for each such series.) Upon any decrease or increase in the Conversion Price
for any series of Preferred Stock, as described in this Section 4, the Conversion Rate for such series
shall be appropriately increased or decreased.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be
converted into fully-paid, non-assessable shares of Common Stock at the then effective Conversion
Rate for such share upon the earlier to occur of: (1) immediately prior to the closing of a firm
commitment underwritten initial public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement filed
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), covering the offer and sale of
the Corporation’s Common Stock, provided that the offering price per share is not less than $2.04 (as
adjusted for Recapitalizations) and the aggregate gross proceeds to the Corporation (before
deducting underwriter commissions and expenses) are not less than $30,000,000 (a “Qualified
IPO”), or (ii) upon the receipt by the Corporation of a written request for such conversion from the
holders of two-thirds (66 2/3%) of the Preferred Stock then outstanding, or, if later, the effective date
for conversion specified in such requests (each of the events referred to in (i) and (ii) are referred to |
herein as an “Automatic Conversion Event’).

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be
issued upon conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder
would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the
then fair market value of a share of Common Stock as determined by the Board of Directors. For
such purpose, all shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder of Preferred Stock shall be
aggregated, and any resulting fractional share of Common Stock shall-be paid in cash. Before any _
holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into full shares of Commen Stock, and
to receive certificates therefor, such holder shall either (A) surrender the certificate or certificates
therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for the Preferred
Stock or (B) notify the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen
or destroyed and execute an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation
from any Joss incurred by it in connection with such certificates, and shall give written notice to the
Corporation at such office that such holder elects to convert the same; provided, however, that on the
date of an Automatic Conversion Event, the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted
automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the
certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent;
provided further, however, that the Corporation shal} not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing
the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such Automatic Conversion Event unless either the
certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are delivered to the Corporation or its transfer
agent as provided above, or the holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such

CADocuments and Settings\TLB\Local Settings\Temporary Internet Files\OLK 1 A5\3210678_2.DOC -6-
certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the
Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such
certificates. On the date of the occurrence of an Automatic Conversion Event, each holder of record
of shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion, notwithstanding that the certificates representing such shares of
Preferred Stock shall not have been surrendered at the office of the Corporation, that notice from the
Corporation shall not have been received by any holder of record of shares of Preferred Stock, or
that the certificates evidencing such shares of Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered to
such holder.

The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after such delivery, or after such agreement and
indemnification, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as
aforesaid and a check payable to the holder in the amount of any cash amounts payable as the result
of a conversion into fractional shares of Common Stock, plus any declared and unpaid dividends on
the converted Preferred Stock. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately
prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be
converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon
such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of
Common Stock on such date; provided, however, that if the conversion is in connection with an
underwritten offer of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act or a merger, sale, financing,
or liquidation of the Corporation or other event, the conversion may, at the option of any holder
tendering Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing of such transaction or
upon the occurrence of such event, in which case the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock.
issuable upon such conversion of the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such
Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such transaction or the occurrence of such
event.

(d) Adjustments to Conversion Price for Diluting Issues.

(i) Special Definition. For purposes of this paragraph 4(d), “Additional
Shares of Common” shall-mean all shares of Common Stock issued (or, pursuant to ~
paragraph 4(d)(iii), deemed to be issued) by the Corporation after the filing of this Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation, other than issuances or deemed issuances of:

(1) shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of shares of
Preferred Stock;

(2) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable to officers,

or other reorganization or to a joint venture agreement, provided, that such issuances are approved
by the Board of Directors;

(7) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable to banks,
equipment lessors or other financial institutions pursuant to a debt financing or commercial] leasing
transaction approved by the Board of Directors, not to exceed in the aggregate 10% of the then

(8) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable in connection with
collaboration, technology license, development, OEM, marketing or other similar agreements,

Corporation’s Common Stock and Preferred Stock;

(9) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable to suppliers or third
party service providers in connection with the provision of goods or services pursuant to transactions
approved by the Board of Directors; and

(10) shares of Common stock that are otherwise excluded by the
affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of at least two-thirds (66 2/3%) of the
Corporation’s outstanding shares of Preferred Stock.

(ii) No Adjustment of Conversion Price. No adjustment in the Conversion
Price of a particular series of Preferred Stock shal] be made in respect of the issuance of Additional
Shares of Common unless the consideration per share (as determined pursuant to paragraph 4(d)(v))
for an Additional Share of Common issued or deemed to be issued by the Corporation is less than
the Conversion Price in effect on the date of, and immediately prior to such issue, for such series of
Preferred Stock.

(iii) | Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the date of the filing of this Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall issue any Options or Convertible Securities or shall fix a
record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive any such

C:\Documents and Sentings\TLB\Local Settings\Temporary Intemet Files\OLK 1 A5\3210678_2.DOC -8-
Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of shares (as set forth in the
instrument relating thereto without regard to any provisions contained therein for a subsequent
adjustment of such number) of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Options or, in the
case of Convertible Securities, the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities or, in the
case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options and the conversion or
exchange of the underlying securities, shall be deemed to have been issued as of the time of such
issue or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record
date, provided that in any such case in which shares are deemed to be issued:

(1) _ no further adjustment in the Conversion Price of any series of
Preferred Stock shall be made upon the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities or shares of
Common Stock in connection with the exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities;

(2) if such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms
provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any change in the consideration payable to the
Corporation or in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or
exchange thereof (other than a change pursuant to the anti-dilution provisions of such Options or
Convertible Securities such as this Section 4(d) or pursuant to Recapitalization provisions of such
Options or Convertible Securities such as Sections 4(e), 4(f) and 4(g) hereof), the Conversion Price
of each series of Preferred Stock and any subsequent adjustments based thereon shall be recomputed
to reflect such change as if such change had been in effect as of the original issue thereof (or upon
the occurrence of the record date with respect thereto);

(3) no readjustment pursuant to clause (2) above shall have the
effect of increasing the Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock to an amount above the
Conversion Price that would have resulted from any other issuances of Additional Shares of
Common and any other adjustments provided for herein between the original adjustment date and
such readjustment date;

(4) —_ upon the expiration of any such Options or any rights of
conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have been exercised, the
Conversion Price of each Series of Preferred Stock computed upon the original issue thereof (or
upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto) and any subsequent adjustments based
thereon shall, upon such expiration, be recomputed as if:

(a) in the case of Convertible Securities or Options for
Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common issued were the shares of Common Stock, if
any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities and the consideration received therefor was the consideration actually
received by the Corporation for the issue of such exercised Options plus the consideration actually
received by the Corporation upon such exercise or for the issue of all such Convertible Securities
which were actually converted or exchanged, plus the additional consideration, if any, actually
received by the Corporation upon such conversion or exchange, and

CADocuments and Settings\TLB\Locat Settings\Temporary Intemet Files\OLK ] A5\3210678_2.DO0C -9-
(b) in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, only
the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were issued at the time of
issue of such Options, and the consideration received by the Corporation for the Additional Shares of
Common deemed to have been then issued was the consideration actually received by the
Corporation for the issue of such exercised Options, plus the consideration deemed to have been
received by the Corporation (determined pursuant to Section 4(d)(v)) upon the issue of the
Convertible Securities with respect to which such Options were actually exercised; and

(c) no readjustment pursuant to clause (4) above shall have
the effect of increasing the Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock to an amount above the
Conversion Price that would have resulted from any other issuances of Additional Shares of
Common and any other adjustments provided for herein between the original adjustment date and
such readjustment date;

(5) if such record date shall have been fixed and such Options or
Convertible Securities are not issued on the date fixed therefor, the adjustment previously made in
the Conversion Price which became effective on such record date shall be canceled as of the close of
business on such record date, and thereafter the Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this
paragraph 4(d)(iii) as of the actual date of their issuance.

(iv) Adjustment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional Shares
of Common. In the event this Corporation shall issue Additional Shares of Common (including

Additional Shares of Common deemed to be issued pursuant to paragraph 4(d)(iii)) without
consideration or for a consideration per share less than the applicable Conversion Price of a series of
Preferred Stock in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such issue, then, the Conversion
Price of the affected series of Preferred Stock shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a
price (calculated to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction,
the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to such issue plus the number of shares which the aggregate consideration received by the
Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of Common so issued would purchase at-such
Conversion Price, and the denominator of which shal] be the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of such Additional Shares of Common
so issued. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Conversion Price shall not be reduced at-such time if
the amount of such reduction would be less than $0.01, but any such amount shall be carried
forward, and a reduction will be made with respect to such amount at the time of, and together with,
any subsequent reduction which, together with such amount and any other amounts so carried
forward, equal $0.01 or more in the aggregate. For the purposes of this Subsection 4(d)(iv), all
shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock and
the exercise and/or conversion of any other outstanding Convertible Securities and all outstanding
Options shall be deemed to be outstanding.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this subsection 4(d),
the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue (or deemed issue) of any Additional
Shares of Common shall be computed as follows:

C:\Documents and Settings\TLB\Local Settings\Temporary Intemet Files\OLK1A5\3210678_2.DOC -10-
(1) Cash and Property. Such consideration shall:

(a) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
agpregate amount of cash received by the Corporation before deducting any reasonable discounts,
commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the Corporation for any underwriting or
otherwise in connection with such issuance;

(b) —_insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair market value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors; and

(c) in the event Additional Shares of Common are issued
together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for consideration which
covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in clauses (a)
and (b) above, as reasonably determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(2) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per
share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common deemed to have been issued
pursuant to paragraph 4(d)(iii) shall be determined by dividing

(x) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Corporation as
consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the minimum aggregate
amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to
any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration) payable to the
Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options for
Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities by

(y) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set forth in the
instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent
adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities. _ ;

(e) Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of Common Stock. In the
event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided (by stock split, by payment of a
stock dividend or otherwise), into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion
Price of each series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall,
concurrently with the effectiveness of such subdivision, be proportionately decreased. In the event
the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined (by reclassification or otherwise) into a
lesser number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Prices in effect immediately prior to such
combination shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination, be proportionately
increased.

(f) Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of Preferred Stock. In the
event the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock or a series of Preferred Stock shall be subdivided (by
stock split, by payment of a stock dividend or otherwise), into a greater number of shares of

CADocuments and Settings\TLB\Local Setsings\Temporary Intemet Files\OLK 1A5\3210678_2-DOC -i1-
Preferred Stock, the Dividend Rate, Original Issue Price and Liquidation Preference of the affected
series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall, concurrently with the
effectiveness of such subdivision, be proportionately decreased. In the event the outstanding shares
of Preferred Stock or a series of Preferred Stock shal] be combined (by reclassification or otherwise)
into a Jesser number of shares of Preferred Stock, the Dividend Rate, Original Issue Price and
Liquidation Preference of the affected series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such
combination shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination, be proportionately
increased.

(g) Adjustments for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. Subject to
Section 3 above (“Liquidation Rights”), if the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the
Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of any other class or
classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a
subdivision or combination of shares provided for above), then, in any such event, in lieu of the
number of shares of Common Stock which the holders would otherwise have been entitled to receive
each holder of such Preferred Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such shares of Preferred
Stock into a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock which a holder of the number of
shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of such series of Preferred Stock immediately
before that change would have been entitled to receive in such reorganization or reclassification, all
subject to further adjustment as provided herein with respect to such other shares.

(h) No Impairment. The Corporation will not through any reorganization, transfer
of assets, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek
to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder
by the Corporation but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of
this Section 4 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to
protect the Conversion Rights of the holders of Preferred Stock against impairment.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 4(h) shall prohibit the Corporation from
amending its Certificate of Incorporation with the requisite consent of its stockholders and the board
of directors.

(i) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation at its expense shall
promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish
to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and
showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation
shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be
furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and readjustments, (ii) the
Conversion Price at the time in effect and (111) the number of shares of Common Stock and the
amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon the conversion of
Preferred Stock.

(Gj) Waiver of Adjustment of Conversion Price, Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, any downward adjustment of the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock
may be waived by the consent or vote of the holders of at least two-thirds (66 2/3%) of the
outstanding shares of such series either before or after the issuance causing the adjustment.

(k) Notices of Record Date. In the event that this Corporation shall propose at

any time:

property, stock or other securities, whether or not a regular cash dividend and whether or not out of
earnings or earned surplus;

(ii) to effect any reclassification or recapitalization of its Common Stock
outstanding involving a change in the Common Stock; or

(iii) to voluntarily liquidate or dissolve or to enter into any transaction
deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation pursuant to Section 3(d);

then, in connection with each such event, this Corporation shall send to the holders of the
Preferred Stock at least 10 days’ prior written notice of the date on which a record shall be taken for
such Distribution (and specifying the date on which the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled
thereto and, if applicable, the amount and character of such Distribution) or for determining rights to
vote in respect of the matters referred to in (ii) and (iii) above.

Such written notice shall be given by first class mail (or express courier), postage prepaid,
addressed to the holders of Preferred Stock at the address for each such holder as shown on the
books of the Corporation and shall be deemed given on the date such notice is mailed.

retrospectively by the vote or written consent of the holders of at least two-thirds (66 2/3%) of the
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class.

In the event the notice requirements of this section are not complied with or waived, the
Corporation shall forthwith either cause the closing of the transaction to be postponed until such
requirements have been complied with, or cancel such transaction, in which event the rights,
preferences and privileges of the holders of the Preferred Stock shall revert to and be the same as
such rights, preferences and privileges existing immediately prior to the date of the first notice
referred to in this section.

(I) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shal] at all
times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock solely
for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock, such number of its
shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then
outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding
shares of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion
of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such
number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.
