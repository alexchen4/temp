ARTICLE V

A. Authorized Capital Stock. The Corporation is authorized to issue two classes of
shares to be designated respectively “Preferred Stock” and “Common Stock,” both of which have
a par value of $0.001 per share. The total number of shares of Preferred Stock authorized is Nine
Million Five Hundred Thousand (9,500,000). The total number of shares of Common Stock
authorized is Twenty Million (20,000,000). The number of authorized shares of Common Stock
may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares of Common Stock then
outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock of the Corporation
entitled to vote (voting together on an as-if-converted basis), irrespective of the provisions of
Section 242(b)(2) of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

B. Rights, Preferences and Restrictions of Preferred Stock. Nine Million Five Hundred
Thousand (9,500,000) shares of the Preferred Stock authorized by this Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation shall be designated as “Series A Preferred Stock.” The rights,
preferences, privileges, and restrictions granted to and imposed on the Series A Preferred Stock
are as set forth below in this Article V(B).

1. Dividend Provisions.

(a) The holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive
non-cumulative dividends in cash at the rate per annum of $0.08 per share of Series A Preferred
Stock (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations, reorganizations,
recapitalizations and the like) when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors, out of any
assets at the time legally available therefor, payable in preference and priority to any payment of
any dividend on Common Stock or any other class of the Corporation’s capital stock. The right
to such dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock shall not be cumulative. No dividends shall be
paid on any share of Common Stock or any other share of the Corporation’s capital stock during
any fiscal year of the Corporation until all then accrued but unpaid dividends on the Series A
Preferred Stock shall have been paid during that fiscal year.

(b) Each holder of shares of Series A Preferred shall be deemed to have
consented to any repurchases by the Corporation of shares of Common Stock issued to or held by
employees, directors or consultants pursuant to agreements providing for such repurchase at the
original purchase or issuance price in connection with termination of employment or services as
a director or consultant, and none of the foregoing shall be deemed to be distributions on the
Common Stock.

2. Preference on Liquidation.

(a) In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation (including as set forth in Section 2(c) below and in any such case,
a “Liquidation”), the holders of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding shall be
entitled to be paid, out of the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its
stockholders, whether from capital, surplus or earnings, before any payment shall be made in
respect of the Corporation’s Common Stock or any other class of the Corporation’s capital stock,
an amount equal to $1.00 per share of Series A Preferred Stock (as adjusted for stock splits,

Gray Cary\PA\10336356.4 2
2503542000100
stock dividends, stock combinations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like), plus all
declared and unpaid dividends with respect to such Series A Preferred Stock. If upon
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the assets of the Corporation available
for distribution to its stockholders shall be insufficient to pay the holders of shares of Series A
Preferred Stock the full amounts to which they shall be entitled pursuant to this Section 2(a), the
holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall share ratably in any distribution of assets in
proportion to the preferential amount each holder is otherwise entitled to receive.

(b) After paying in full the preferential amounts set forth in Section 2(a)
above, the remaining assets available for distribution, if any, shall be distributed ratably among
the holders of shares of Common Stock and Series A Preferred Stock on an as-converted basis.

(c) A merger or consolidation of the Corporation into or with another
corporation (except into or with a wholly-owned subsidiary) or any other reorganization or
acquisition in whatever manner structured, in each case in which the stockholders of the
Corporation immediately prior to such merger, consolidation or other transaction shall own
immediately following such event, less than fifty percent (50%) of the voting power of the
surviving corporation or the sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the
assets of the Corporation in one transaction or a series of transactions shall be deemed to be a
Liquidation as such term is used herein.

(d) In the event the Corporation shall propose a Liquidation, the
Corporation shall, within ten (10) days after the date the Board of Directors approves such
action, or twenty (20) days prior to any stockholders’ meeting called to approve such action, or
twenty (20) days after the commencement of any involuntary proceeding, whichever is earlier,
give each holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock initial written notice of the proposed
action. Such initial written notice shall describe the material terms and conditions of such
proposed action, including a description of the stock, cash and property to be received by the
holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and by the holders of shares of Common Stock
upon consummation of the proposed action and the date of delivery thereof. If any material
change in the facts set forth in the initial notice shall occur, the Corporation shall promptly give
written notice to each holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock of such material change. By
giving notice to the Corporation prior to any Liquidation, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock
may elect to forego the liquidation preference provided for in this Section 2 and instead convert
their shares of Series A Preferred Stock into Common Stock pursuant to Section 4 immediately
prior to such event.

(e) The Corporation shall not consummate any Liquidation before the
expiration of twenty (20) days after the mailing of the initial written notice or ten (10) days after
the mailing of any subsequent written notice, whichever is later; provided, however, that any
such 20-day or 10-day period may be shortened upon the written consent of the holders of
seventy-one percent (71%) of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock.

(f) Whenever the distribution provided for in this Section 2 shall be
payable in securities or property other than cash, the value of such distribution shall be the fair
market value of such securities or other property as determined by the Board of Directors in good

Gray Cary\PA\10336356.4 3
2503542-900100
faith, including the Series A Designees (as such term is defined herein). Any securities shall be
valued as follows:

(i) Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar
restriction on free marketability:

(A) If traded on a securities exchange or on the Nasdaq
National Market, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the
securities on such exchange or system over the fifteen (15) day period ending three (3) days prior
to the closing;

(B) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the
fifteen (15) day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing; and

(C) If there is no active market, the value shall be the fair
market value thereof, as determined by the Board of Directors of the Corporation, including the
Series A Designees.

(ii) The method of valuation of securities subject to investment
letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of
a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount
from the market value determined as above in 2((i)(A), (B) or (C) to reflect the approximate
fair market value thereof, as determined by the Board of Directors of the Corporation in good
faith, including the Series A Designees.

(g) In the event the requirements of this Section 2 are not complied with,
this Corporation shall forthwith either:

(i) cause such closing to be postponed until such time as the
requirements of Section 2 have been complied with; or

(ii) cancel such transaction, in which event the rights,
preferences and privileges of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall revert to and be
the same as such rights, preferences and privileges as set forth herein.

3. Voting Rights.

(a) General. Except as otherwise required by law, or as set forth herein,
each holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to the number of votes equal to
the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series A Preferred Stock could
be converted on the record date for the vote or consent of stockholders or, if no record date is
established, at the date such vote is taken of any consent of stockholders solicited, and shall have
voting rights and powers equal to the voting rights and powers of the Common Stock. The
holder of each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to notice of any stockholders’
meeting in accordance with the Bylaws of the Corporation and shall vote with holders of the
Common Stock upon any matter submitted to a vote of stockholders, except those matters
required by law or this Certificate of Incorporation to be submitted to a class vote. Fractional

Gray Cary\PA\1L0336356.4 4
2503542-900100

votes by the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall not, however, be permitted and any
fractional voting rights resulting from the above formula (after aggregating all shares into which
shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by each holder could be converted) shall be rounded
down to the nearest whole number with one-half and above being rounded upward.

(b) Voting for the Election of Directors. The holders of Series A
Preferred Stock, voting together as a separate class and on an as-converted basis, shall be entitled
to elect three (3) directors of the Corporation (each a “Series A Designee”) at each annual or
special election of directors or pursuant to such written consent of the stockholders for the
election of directors. The holders of outstanding Common Stock, voting together as a separate
class, shall be entitled to elect one (1) director of the Corporation at each annual or special
election of directors or pursuant to each written consent of the stockholders for the election of
directors. The holders of Series A Preferred Stock and Common Stock, voting together as a
single class and on an as-converted basis, shall be entitled to elect any remaining directors of the
Corporation.

In the case of any vacancy (other than a vacancy caused by removal) in the office
of a director occurring among the directors elected by the holders of a class or series of stock
pursuant to this Section 4(b), the remaining directors so elected by that class or series may by
affirmative vote of a majority thereof (or the remaining director so elected if there be but one, or
if there are no such directors remaining, by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of
the shares of that class or series), elect a successor or successors to hold office for the unexpired
term of the director or directors whose place or places shall be vacant. Any director who shall
have been elected by the holders of a class or series of stock, or by any directors so elected as
provided in the immediately preceding sentence, hereof may be removed during the aforesaid
term of office, either with or without cause, by, and only by, the affirmative vote of the holders
of the shares of the class or series of stock entitled to elect such director or directors, given either
at a special meeting of such stockholders duly called for that purpose or pursuant to a written
consent of stockholders, and any vacancy thereby created may be filled by the holders of that
class or series of stock represented at the meeting or pursuant to unanimous written consent.

4. Conversion Rights. The holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall have
conversion rights as follows:

(a) Each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the
option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share, at the principal
office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for such Series A Preferred Stock, into fully paid
and nonassessable shares of Common Stock of the Corporation. The number of shares of
Common Stock into which each share of Series A Preferred Stock may be converted shall be
determined by dividing $1.00 by the appropriate Conversion Price (as hereinafter defined) in
effect on the date of conversion as such date is determined pursuant to Section 4(c). The initial
Series A Conversion Price per share shall be $1.00, subject to adjustment as provided below.

(b) Each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be converted into
Common Stock automatically in the manner provided herein based on the Series A Conversion
Price then in effect upon the earlier of (i) the closing of a firm commitment underwritten public
offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as

Gray Cary\PA\10336356.4 5
2503542-900100

amended, from which the Corporation receives net proceeds of not less than $30,000,000 and
where the offering price per share (prior to the deduction of underwriting commissions and
expenses) is at least $5.00 (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations,
reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) or (ii) the consent of the holders of at least
seventy-one percent (71%) of the then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock.

(c) Before any holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to convert the same into Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the certificate or
certificates therefor, duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by proper instruments of transfer, at
the principal office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for the Series A Preferred Stock,
and shall give written notice to the Corporation at such office that such holder elects to convert
the same and shall state in writing therein the name or names in which such holder wishes the
certificate or certificates for Common Stock to be issued; provided, however, that in the event of
an automatic conversion pursuant to subparagraph 4(b), the outstanding shares of all Series A
Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically without any further action by the holders of
such shares and whether or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the
Corporation or its transfer agent; provided further, however, that the Corporation shall not be
obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such
automatic conversion unless either the certificates evidencing such shares of Series A Preferred
Stock are delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent as provided above, or the holder
notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or
destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the
Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates. As soon as
practicable thereafter, the Corporation shall issue and deliver at such office to such holder’s
nominee or nominees, certificates for the number of whole shares of Common Stock to which
such holder shall be entitled. A conversion pursuant to Section 4(a) shall be deemed to have
been made as of the date of such surrender of the Series A Preferred Stock to be converted, and
the person or persons entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shal]
be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such Common Stock on said date. A
conversion pursuant to Section 4(b) shall be deemed to have been made as of the date of the
applicable event specified in Section 4(b) and the person entitled to receive the Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of
such Common Stock on said date.

(d) No fractional shares shal! be issued upon the conversion of any share
or shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, and the number of shares of Common Stock to be
issued shall be rounded downward to the nearest whole share. In lieu of issuing any fractional
shares, the Corporation shall pay the holder otherwise entitled to such fraction a sum in cash
equal to the fair market value of such fraction on the date of conversion as determined by the
Board of Directors. Whether or not fractional shares are issuable upon such conversion shall be
determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock the holder is at
the time converting into Common Stock and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable
upon such aggregate conversion.

(e) The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available, out of its
authorized but unissued Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of
Series A Preferred Stock, the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon the

Gray Cary\PA\10336356.4 6
2503542-900100
conversion of all shares of Series A Preferred Stock from time to time outstanding. The
Corporation shall from time to time (subject to obtaining necessary Board of Directors and
stockholder approvals), in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, increase the
authorized amount of its Common Stock if at any time the authorized number of shares of
Common Stock remaining unissued shall not be sufficient to permit the conversion of all of the
shares of Series A Preferred Stock at the time outstanding.

(f) In the event of any taking by the Corporation of a record of the holders
of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof who are entitled to
receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend) or other distribution, any right to subscribe for,
purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of stock of any class or any other securities or property,
or to receive any other right, the Corporation shall mail to each holder of Preferred Stock, at least
twenty (20) days prior to the date specified therein, a notice specifying the date on which any
such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or right, and the amount
and character of such dividend, distribution or right.

5. Adjustment of Conversion Prices for Certain Dilutive Issuances. The Series A
Conversion Price from time to time in effect shall be subject to adjustment as follows:

(a) In case the Corporation shall at any time (i) subdivide the outstanding
Common Stock or (ii) issue a stock dividend in shares of Common Stock on its outstanding
Common Stock, the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the
Series A Preferred Stock immediately prior thereto shall be proportionately increased by the
same ratio as the subdivision or dividend (with appropriate adjustments in the Series A
Conversion Price). In case the Corporation shall at any time combine its outstanding Common
Stock into a smaller number of shares, the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock immediately prior to such combination shall be
proportionately decreased by the same ratio as the combination (with appropriate adjustments in
the Series A Conversion Price). All such adjustments described herein shall be effective at the
close of business on the date of such subdivision, stock dividend or combination, as the case may
be.

(b) In case of any capital reorganization, any consolidation or merger that
is not a Liquidation or any reclassification of the Common Stock of the Corporation (including a
binding share exchange which reclassifies or changes the outstanding capital stock); the Series A
Preferred Stock shall thereafter be convertible into that number of shares of stock or other
securities or property to which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the
Corporation deliverable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock immediately prior to
such reorganization, consolidation, merger or recapitalization would have been entitled upon
such reorganization, consolidation, merger or reclassification.

(c) Upon the issuance or sale by the Corporation on or after the date on
which the Corporation first issues shares of Series A Preferred Stock, of any Equity Securities
(as defined below) at a consideration per share less than the Series A Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to the time of such issue or sale, then forthwith upon such issue or sale, the
Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the time of each such issuance or sale
shall be adjusted to a price (calculated to the nearest tenth of a cent) determined by dividing:

Gray Cary\PA\10336356.4 7
2503542-9001 00
(i) an amount equal to the sum of (x) the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale multiplied by the then
existing Series A Conversion Price, (y) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion or exchange of any obligation, option, warrant or share of stock or other security of
the Corporation convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock of the
Corporation outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale multiplied by the then existing
Series A Conversion Price, and (z) an amount equal to the aggregate “consideration actually
received” by the Corporation upon such issue or sale, by

(ii) | an amount equal to the sum of the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale and the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exchange of any obligations or of any shares of
stock of the Corporation outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale and the additional
shares of Common Stock issued as and/or issuable upon conversion or exchange of the Equity
Securities issued in such issuance or sale.

(d) For purposes of this Section 5, the following provisions shall be
applicable:

(i) The term “Equity Securities” as used in this Section 5 shall
mean any shares of Common Stock, or any obligation, option, warrant or share of stock or other
security of the Corporation convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock
issued or issuable after the date of the first issuance of Series A Preferred Stock except for (A) up
to 1,737,000 shares of Common Stock or options to purchase Common Stock issued or issuable
to officers, directors, employees or consultants of the Corporation pursuant to any agreement,
plan or arrangement approved by the Corporation’s Board of Directors, including the Series A
Designee nominated by Vanguard Venture Partners (provided it or an affiliate is then a
stockholder of the Corporation); (B) securities issued pursuant to a transaction described in
Section 5(a) or (b) hereof; (C) securities issued in connection with an equipment lease, bank line
financing or corporate partnering transaction approved by the Board of Directors, including the
Series A Designee nominated by Vanguard Venture Partners (provided it or an affiliate is then a
stockholder of the Corporation); (D) Common Stock issued upon conversion of Series A
Preferred Stock; and (E) securities issued in connection with an acquisition of another company
by merger, purchase of substantially all of the assets or other reorganization in a transaction
approved by the Board of Directors, including the Series A Designee nominated by Vanguard
Venture Partners (provided it or an affiliate is then a stockholder of the Corporation).

(ii} — In the case of an issue or sale for cash of shares of
Common Stock, the “consideration actually received” by the Corporation therefor shall be
deemed to be the amount of cash received, before deducting therefrom any commissions or
expenses actually paid by the Corporation.

(iii) In case of the issuance (otherwise than upon conversion or
exchange of obligations or shares of stock of the Corporation) of additional shares of Common
Stock for a consideration other than cash or a consideration partly other than cash, the amount of
the consideration other than cash received by the Corporation for such shares shall be deemed to

Gray Cary\PA\10336356.4 8
2503542-900100
be the fair value of such consideration as determined in good faith by the Corporation’s Board of
Directors irrespective of any accounting treatment,

(iv) Incase of the issuance by the Corporation in any manner of
any rights to subscribe for or to purchase shares of Common Stock, or any options for the
purchase of shares of Common Stock or stock convertible into Common Stock, all shares of
Common Stock or stock convertible into Common Stock to which the holders of such rights or
options shall be entitled to subscribe for or purchase pursuant to such rights or options shall be
deemed “outstanding” as of the date of the offering of such rights or the granting of such options,
as the case may be, and the minimum aggregate consideration named in such rights or options
for the acquisition of the shares of Common Stock or stock convertible into Common Stock
covered thereby, plus the consideration, if any, received by the Corporation for such rights or
options, shall be deemed to be the “consideration actually received” by the Corporation (as of the
date of the offering of such rights or the granting of such options, as the case may be) for the
issuance of such shares.

(v) Incase of the issuance or issuances by the Corporation in
any manner of any obligations or of any shares of stock of the Corporation that shall be
convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock, all shares of Common Stock issuable upon
the conversion or exchange of such obligations or shares shall be deemed issued as of the date
such obligations or shares are issued, and the amount of the “consideration actually received” by
the Corporation for such additional shares of Common Stock shall be deemed to be the total of
(x) the amount of consideration received by the Corporation upon the issuance of such
obligations or shares, plus (y) the minimum aggregate consideration, if any, other than such
obligations or shares, receivable by the Corporation upon such conversion or exchange.

(vi) |The amount of the “consideration actually received” by the
Corporation upon the issuance of any rights or options referred to in subsection (iv) above or
upon the issuance of any obligations or shares which are convertible or exchangeable as
described in subsection (v) above, and the amount of the consideration, if any, other than such
obligations or shares so convertible or exchangeable, receivable by the Corporation upon the
exercise, conversion or exchange thereof shall be determined in the same manner provided in
subsections (ii) and (iii) above with respect to the consideration received by the Corporation in
case of the issuance of additional shares of Common Stock. On the expiration of any rights or
options referred to in subsection (iv), or the termination of any right of conversion or exchange
referred to in subsection (v), or any change in the number of shares of Common Stock
deliverable upon exercise of such options or rights or upon conversion of or exchange of such
convertible or exchangeable securities, the Series A Conversion Price then in effect shall
forthwith be readjusted to such Series A Conversion Price as would have been obtained had the
adjustments made upon the issuance of such option, right or convertible or exchangeable
securities been made upon the basis of the delivery of only the number of shares of Common
Stock actually delivered or to be delivered upon the exercise of such rights or options or upon the
conversion or exchange of such securities.

(vii) In the event the Corporation shall declare a distribution
payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by this Corporation or
other persons or options or rights not referred to in this Section 5(d), then, in each such case, the

Gray Cary\PA\10336356.4 9
2503542.900100
holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to the distributions provided for in
Section 1 above, and no adjustment to the Series A Conversion Price provided for in this
Section 5 shall be applicable.

(e) Subject to the right of the Corporation to amend its Certificate of
Incorporation upon obtaining necessary approvals required by its Certificate of Incorporation and
applicable law, this Corporation will not, by amendment of its Certificate of Incorporation or
through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of
secutities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of
any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by this Corporation, but will at all times
in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Section 5 and in the taking of
all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the
holders of the Series A Preferred Stock against impairment. In the event that at any time as a
result of an adjustment made, the holder of any share of Series A Preferred Stock thereafter
converted shall become entitled to receive any shares of the Corporation other than Common
Stock, thereafter the conversion price of such other shares shall be subject to readjustment from
time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions with
respect to Common Stock contained herein.

_ (f) Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the
Series A Conversion Price or the securities or other property to be received upon conversion of
the Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 5, this Corporation at its expense shall
promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof, and
shall prepare and furnish to each holder of Series A Preferred Stock affected thereby a certificate
setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such
adjustment or readjustment is based. This Corporation shall, upon the written request at any time
of any holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such
holder a like certificate setting forth (A) such adjustment or readjustment, (B) the Series A
Conversion Price at the time in effect and (C) the number of shares of Common Stock and the
amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon the conversion of
such holder’s shares.

(g) No adjustment in the Series A Conversion Price need be made if such
adjustment would result in a change in the Series A Conversion Price of less than $0.01. Any
adjustment of less than $0.01 which is not made shall be carried forward and shall be made at the
time of and together with any subsequent adjustment which, on a cumulative basis, amounts to
an adjustment of $0.01 or more in the Series A Conversion Price.

(h) The Corporation will pay any and all documentary, stamp or similar
issue or transfer taxes payable in respect of the issue and delivery of Common Stock or other
securities or properties on conversion of any shares of the Series A Preferred Stock other than
any such taxes payable by reason of the issuance of such Common Stock, or other securities or
properties in names other than those in which the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be
converted stand.

6. Changes. The Corporation shall not, whether by merger, reorganization or
otherwise, without first obtaining the approval, by vote or written consent, in the manner

Gray Cary\PA\10336356.4 10
2503542-900100

provided by law, of the holders of at least seventy-one percent (71%) of the total number of
shares of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding, voting as a separate class:

(a) amend the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Corporation;

(b) undertake or effect any merger, consolidation or reorganization,
including any Liquidation;

(c) authorize or issue any other security having rights preferential to or on
a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock as to voting, dividend, redemption or liquidation
preferences or convertible into such a security or which amends the terms of or reclassifies any
class of equity securities with the same effect;

(d) increase the authorized number of shares of Common Stock, Preferred
Stock, or Series A Preferred Stock;

(e) redeem or repurchase any shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock,
except for repurchases of Common Stock from employees, directors or consultants in connection
with termination of employment or services;

(f) pay or declare a dividend on any security of the Corporation; or
(g) increase or decrease the authorized number of directors.

7. Status of Converted Stock. In the event any shares of Series A Preferred
Stock shall be converted pursuant to Section 5 hereof, the shares so converted shall be canceled
and shall not be issuable by this Corporation. The Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation
shall be appropriately amended to effect the corresponding reduction in this Corporation’s
authorized capital stock.

C. Common Stock. The rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to and
imposed on the Common Stock are as set forth below:

1. Dividend Rights. Subject to the prior rights of holders of all classes of stock at
the time outstanding having prior rights as to dividends, the holders of the Common Stock shall
be entitled to receive, when and as declared by the Board of Directors, out of any assets of this

or serves or served at any other enterprise as a director or officer at the request of the
Corporation or any predecessor to the Corporation.

Neither any amendment nor repeal of this Article X, nor the adoption of any provision of

reduce the effect of this Article X in respect of any matter occurring, or any action or proceeding
accruing or arising or that, but for this Article X, would accrue or arise, prior to such
amendment, repeal or adoption of an inconsistent provision.
