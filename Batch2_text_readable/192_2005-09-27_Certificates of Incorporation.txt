(c) (i) For purposes of this Section 2, unless otherwise agreed in writing
by the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of the Preferred Stock voting together as a single class (the "Majority Preferred
Holders"), a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation shall be deemed to be
occasioned by, and to include: (A) any acquisition of the Corporation by another person or entity
(or group of persons or entities) by means of any transaction or series of transactions (including,
without limitation, any reorganization, consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into

liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation pursuant to the terms hereof unless the
terms of such transaction or transactions provide that the consideration to be paid to the
stockholders of the Corporation is to be allocated in accordance with the preferences and

(A) Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar
restrictions on free marketability covered by (B) below:

(1) If traded on a securities exchange or through NASDAQ
National Market System, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the
securities on such exchange over the thirty-day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing;

(2) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the
thirty-day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing; and

(3) If there is no active public market, the value shall be the
fair market value thereof, as determined by the Board and approved by the Majomity Preferred
Holders.

(B) The method of valuation of securities subject to investment letter
or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of a
stockholder's status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount
from the market value determined as above in (A) (1), (2) or (3) to reflect the approximate fair
market value thereof, as determined by the Board and approved by the Majority Preferred
Holders.

(iii) In the event that there is more than one type of consideration
payable to the Corporation or its stockholders in connection with any Sale Transaction, the
holders of the Preferred Stock may elect, by the written consent or vote of the Majority Preferred
Holders, to receive one or more specified types of consideration in respect of the Scries B
Preference Amount and the Series A Preference Amount. Such type or types of consideration

3

and the respective amounts of such types of consideration to be received by the holders of
Preferred Stock in respect of the Series B Preference Amount and the Series A Preference
Amount shall be determined by the Majority Preferred Holders.

3. Conversion. Thc holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion
rights as follows:

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at
the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share, at the office
of the Corporation or any transfer agent for such stock, into fully paid and nonassessable shares
of Common Stock of the Corporation. The number of shares of Common Stock into which each
share of Series B Preferred Stock may be converted shall be determined by dividing the Original
Series B Issue Price by the Applicable Conversion Price for the Series B Preferred Stock in effect
on the date that the holder thereof elects to convert such share. The initial Applicable
Conversion Price of the Series B Preferred Stock is the Original Series B Issue Price. The
number of shares of Common Stock into which each share of Series A Preferred Stock may be
converted shall be determined by dividing the Original Series A Issue Price by the Applicable
Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred Stock in effect on the date that the holder thereof
elects to convert such share. The initial Applicable Conversion Price of the Series A Preferred
Stock is $0.29453. The Applicable Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock is subject
to adjustment after the Purchase Date (as defined below) as set forth in this Section 3.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically
be converted into shares of Common Stock (as sct forth in Section 3(a)) upon the earlier of (i) the
consummation of a finn commitment underwritten public offering of Common Stock registered
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (x) at a public offering price of not less than 400%
of the Ongimal Series B Issue Price, (y) resulting in net proceeds to the Corporation of not less
than $20,000,000 and (z) after which the Common Stock is either listed on a national securities
exchange or traded in the NASDAQ National Markct System and (ii) the date specified by
written consent of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Series B
Preferred Stock (the "Required Holders"). Such conversion shail be automatic, without need for
any further action by the holders of shares of Preferred Stock and regardless of whether the
certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent;
provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion unless certificates evidencing such
shares of Preferred Stock so converted are surrendered to the Corporation or the holder of record
of such shares notifies the Corporation that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed
and such holder executes an agreement to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it
in connection with such certificates, in cach case in accordance with the procedures described in
Section 3(c) below. Upon the conversion of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 3(b), the
Corporation shall promptly send written notice thereof, by registered or certified mail, return
receipt requested and postage prepaid, by hand delivery or by overnight delivery, to each holder
of record of Preferred Stock at such holder's address then shown on the records of the
Corporation, which notice shall state that certificates evidencing shares of Preferred Stock must
be surrendered at the office of the Corporation (or of its transfer agent for the Common Stock, if
applicable) in the manner described in Section 3(c) below.
(c) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to receive certificates representing shares of Common Stock into which shares of
Preferred Stock are converted pursuant to this Section 3, such holder shall surrender thc
certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any
transfer agent for the Preferred Stock (or such holder notifies the Corporation that such
certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and such holder executes an agreement to
indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates), and
shall give written notice to the Corporation at such office of the name or names in which the
certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued. The Corporation shall, as
soon as practicable and in no event later than ten (10) days after the delivery of said certificates,
issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or nominees
of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which
such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid. The person or persons entitled to receive the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion pursuant to this Section 3 shall be treated for all
purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock as of the effective date
of such conversion. If the conversion is in connection with an underwritten offering of securities
registered pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended or any Sale Transaction, the
conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering Preferred Stock for conversion, be
conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to such
offering or the closing of such Sale Transaction, in which event the person(s) entitled to receive
the Common Stock upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have
converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities or
the closing of such Sale Transaction.

(d) Conversion Price Adjustments for Certain Dilutive Issuances, Splits and
Combinations. The Applicable Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock shall be subject to

adjustment from time to time as follows:

(i) (A) _ In the event that the Corporation shall issue or sell, at any
time, or from time to time, after the tyme upon which any shares of Senes B Preferred Stock were
first issued (the "Purchase Date"), any Additional Stock (as defined below) without
consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Applicable Conversion Price for any
series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock, the
Applicable Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to
each such issuance shall be reduced, concurrently with such issuance or sale, to a price
determined by multiplying the Applicable Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock by
a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the sum of (x) the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale and (y) the number of shares of
Common Stock that the aggregate consideration actually received by the Corporation for such
Additional Stock so issued would purchase at the Applicable Conversion Price for such series of
Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale, and the denominator of
which shall be equal to thc sum of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to such issue or sale and (y) the number of shares of Additional Stock
(calculated on an as converted to Common Stock basis) so issued or sold. For the purpose of the
above calculation, the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such
issue or sale shall be calculated as if all shares of Preferred Stock and all vested securities that are

then exercisable for or convertible into shares of Common Stock had been fully exercised for or
converted into shares of Common Stock as of such time.

(B) Except to the limited extent provided for in Sections
3(dXi)(E)(3) and (E)(4), no adjustment of any Applicable Conversion Price of any series of
Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 3(d) shall have the effect of increasing the Applicable
Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock above the Applicable Conversion Price for
such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such adjustment.

(C) In the case of the issuance or sale of Additional Stock for
cash, the consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor after deducting
any discounts, commissions or other expenses paid or incurred by the Corporation in connection
with the issuance or sale thereof.

(D) In the case of the issuance or sale of the Additional Stock
for a consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be
deemed to be the fair market value thereof as determined in good faith by the Board and the
Required Holders irrespective of any accounting treatment. The issuance or sale of Options (as
defined below) or Convertible Securities (as defined below) together with other securities of the
Corporation in an integrated transaction in which no specific consideration is allocated to such
Options or Convertible Securities shall be deemed to be issuance of shares of Common Stock at
no consideration.

(E) _In the event that the Corporation at any time or from time to
lime after the Purchase Date shall issue any securities by their terms convertible into or
exchangeable for Common Stock ("Convertible Securities") or any options, rights or warrants to
subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire Common Stock or Convertible Securities
("Options") or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities
then entitled to receive any such Options or Convertible Securities, the following provisions shall
apply for all purposes of this Section 3(d)(i) and Section 3(d)(1i):

(1) The aggregate maximum number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable upon exercise of such Options, assuming the
satisfaction of any conditions to exercisability (including, without limitation, the
passage of time), shall be deemed to be Additional Stock issued at the time such
Options were issucd and for a consideration equal to the consideration
(determined in the manner provided in Sections 3(d)(i)(C) and 3(d)(i)(D)), if any,
received by the Corporation upon the issuance of such Options plus the minimum
exercise price provided in such Options.

(2) The aggregate maximum number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of or in exchange for such
Convertible Securities or upon the exercise of Options for such Convertible
Securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thcreof, assuming the
satisfaction of any conditions to convertibility or exchangeability and
exercisability (including, without limitation, the passage of time), shall be deemed
to be Additional Stock issued at the time such Convertible Securities were issued
or such Options for Convertible Securities were issued and for a consideration

6

equal to the consideration, if any, received by the Corporation for any such
Convertible Securities and related Options, plus the minimum additional
consideration, if any, to be received by the Corporation upon the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Secunties or the exercise of any related Options
(the consideration in each case to be determined in the manner provided in
Sections 3(d)(i)(C) and 3(d)(i)(D)).

(3) In the event of any change in the number of shares
of Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to the Corporation
upon exercise of such Options or upon conversion of or in exchange for such
Convertible Securities (including, without limitation, a change resulting from the
antidilution provisions thereof), the Applicable Conversion Price for any series of
Preferred Stock to the extent in any way affected by or initially determined using
such Options or Convertible Securities shall be recomputed to reflect such change.

(4) Upon the expiration of any such Options, the
Applicable Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock to the extent in any
way affected by the issuance of such Options shall be recomputed to reflect the
issuance of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually issued or
issuable upon the exercise of such Options.

(5) No readjustment or readjustments pursuant to either
Section 3(d)(i)(E)(3) or (4) shall have the effect of increasing the Applicable
Conversion Price of any serics of Preferred Stock to an amount that exceeds the
lower of (x) the Applicable Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock on
the Purchase Date or (y) the Applicable Conversion Price for such series of
Preferred Stock that would have resulted from all issuances of Additional Stock
between the Purchase Date and such readjustment date. In the event of any
adjustment to the Applicable Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock as
a result of the issuance of Options or Convertible Securities pursuant to this
Section 3(d), no further adjustment to the Applicable Conversion Price for such
series of Preferred Stock shall be made for the actual issuance of Common Stock
upon the exercise of any such Options or the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities.

or granted after the Purchase Date pursuant to the Corporation's Option Plan, as amended

entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock
or other securities or rights convertible into, or entitling the holder thereof to receive directly or
indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock ("Common Stock Equivalents") without payment
of any consideration by such holder for the additional shares of Common Stock or Common
Stock Equivalents (including the additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion
or exercise thereof), then, as of such record date (or the date of such dividend distribution, split
or subdivision if no record date is fixed), the Applicable Conversion Price for each serics of
Preferred Stock shall be appropriately decreased so that the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable on conversion thereof shall be increased in proportion to such increase of the aggregate
of shares of Common Stock outstanding and those issuable with respect to such Common Stock
Equivalents (determined in the manner provided for deemed issuances set forth in Section

3(4))E)).

(iv) If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any time
after the Purchase Date is decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of Common
Stock, then, following the record date of such combination, the Applicable Conversion Price for
each series of Preferred Stock shall be appropriately increased so that the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable on conversion thereof shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease
in outstanding shares.

(e) Reorganizations, Mergers or Consolidations. If at any time or from time
to time the Common Stock is converted into other securities, assets or property, whether pursuant

§
to a reorganization, merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of the Corporation's
assets or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination provided for elsewhere in this

Section 2), provision shall be made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock shall thereafter be
entitled to receive upon conversion of the Preferred Stock, the number of shares of stock or other
securities, assets or property of the Corporation or otherwise to which a holder of Common Stock
deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled in connection with such transaction.

(f) No Fractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments.

(i) No fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of any
share or shares of the Preferred Stock after aggregating all shares owned by the holder thereof
and, in lieu of any fractional shares to which such holder would otherwise be entitled, the
Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the then effective fair market
value of such share as determined by the Board in good faith.

(ii) | Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the
Applicable Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 3, the Corporation, at its expense, shall
promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and

all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock,
solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock, such
number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, in addition to such other remedies as
shall be available to the holder of Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate
action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose,
including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite shareholder approval
