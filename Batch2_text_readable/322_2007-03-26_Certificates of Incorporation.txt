(1i) nineteen million five hundred thousand (19,500,000) shares of preferred stock, par

B. Terms of Preferred Stock.

1. Series A Preferred Stock. The preferences and relative, participating, optional and other
special rights of Series A Preferred Stock, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions
thereof, are as follows:

(i) Dividends. The holders of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock shall not be
entitled to receive any fixed dividends thereon. Cash or other types of dividends (other than fixed
dividends) may be declared and paid upon the Series A Preferred Stock in such amounts and at
such times as the Corporation’s Board of Directors (“Board of Directors”) may determine, which
determination shall require the prior approval of a majority of the ‘Series A Directors” as such
term is defined in that Amended and Restated Shareholders Agreement dated on or about March
__, 2007 by and among the Corporation and the other parties thereto, as amended, if amended,
from time-to-time (“Shareholders Agreement’), whether or not any dividends are declared and
paid upon the Common Stock.

(ii) Redemption.

(a) Right to Require Redemption. Shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be
redeemed by the Corporation within 60 days after delivery of written notice from the holders of at
least 66.67% of the then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock (the “Supermajority
Holders”) requesting redemption of all or any portion of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock at any
time on or after the fifth (5) anniversary of the Original Issue Date (as defined below).

(b) Redemption Price. The redemption price (the “Redemption Price’) for
any shares of Series A Preferred Stock redeemed under this Section B.1(ii) shall be equal to the
greater of: (i) $0.415702 (the “Original Issue Price”) per share (as adjusted for any stock
dividends, combinations, reverse stock splits, stock splits, recapitalizations, reorganizations,
reclassifications or other similar event with respect to shares) plus all declared but un-paid
dividends thereon, and (ii) the Fair Market Value of such shares on an As-If-Converted Basis as
hereinafter defined, at the time of such redemption. ‘Fair Market Value” shall mean the fair
market value as agreed upon by a majority of the disinterested directors of the Corporation and the
Supermajority Holders, and in the event that the Corporation and the Supermajority Holders do
not agree upon the fair market value, then the Fair Market Value shall be as determined by an
independent third party appraiser without taking into consideration any discount for minority
positions.

(c) Procedure for Redemption.

(i) Any notice by the Supermajority Holders of their election that shares
be redeemed which is to be delivered to the Corporation pursuant to clause B.1(ii)(a) shall be
delivered to the Corporation at its principal place of business at the time, to the attention of the
President, by (A) first class certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, (B) nationally recognized
overnight courier service, or (C) personal delivery.
(ii) On or prior to any redemption date, each holder of Series A Preferred
Stock which has shares which are to be redeemed on such redemption date shall surrender her, his or
its certificates representing the shares to be redeemed on such redemption date to the Corporation, in
the manner and at the place designated by the Corporation, acting reasonably, and against such
surrender the Redemption Price of such shares shall be paid on the redemption date to the order of the
person whose name appears on each such certificate as the owner thereof. Each surrendered
certificate shall be canceled and retired. If fewer than all the shares represented by any such
certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares.

(iii) If the funds of the Corporation legally available for redemption of
the Series A Preferred Stock on a redemption date are insufficient to redeem the full number of
shares of Series A Preferred Stock required by this Certificate of Incorporation to be redeemed on
such date, those funds which are legally available shall be used to redeem the maximum possible
number of shares of such Series A Preferred Stock, ratably among the holders of the Series A
Preferred Stock based upon the number of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock that each such
holder thereof is entitled to have redeemed on such redemption date. At any time thereafter when
additional funds of the Corporation become legally available for the redemption of the Series A
Preferred Stock, such funds will be used promptly to redeem the balance of the Series A Preferred
Stock which the Corporation was theretofore obligated to redeem, ratably on the basis set forth in the
preceding sentence.

(iv) The date on which the redemption of any Series A Preferred Stock is
to occur may be delayed if an independent third-party appraisal is required to determine the
Redemption Price. In such case, said redemption shall occur within thirty (30) days of the
determination of Fair Market Value by the independent third-party appraiser.

(iii) Liquidation Rights.

(a) In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation or other distribution of assets of the Corporation among its shareholders for the
purpose of winding-up the Corporation’s affairs, whether voluntary or involuntary (each a
“Dissolution Event”), each holder of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
receive, prior and in preference to any distribution of any of the assets or surplus funds of the
Corporation to the holders of the Common Stock or any other security ranking junior to the Series
A Preferred Stock as to liquidation, distributions in cash, securities or other property (valued as
provided in paragraph (d) of this Section B.1(iii)) equal to the Original Issue Price then held by
such holder (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, reverse stock splits, stock splits,
recapitalizations, reorganizations, reclassifications or other similar event with respect to shares),
plus all declared, but un-paid dividends thereon (the “Series A Preference Amount”). If upon the
occurrence of a Dissolution Event, the assets and funds legally available for distribution among
the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such
holders of the full Series A Preference Amount, then the entire assets and funds of the
Corporation legally available for distribution shall be distributed ratably among the holders of
Series A Preferred Stock in proportion to the full Series A Preference Amount each such holder is
otherwise entitled to receive.

(b) For purposes of this Article Fourth of this Certificate of Incorporation,
unless otherwise determined by the Supermajority Holders, each of the following (each a
“Fundamental Change’) as well as a sale to a Purchaser (as herein defined) conducted in
accordance with paragraph (e) of this Section B.1(iii) (a “Drag-Along Sale”), shall be treated as a
Dissolution Event and shall entitle the holders of Series A Preferred Stock to receive at the closing
from the Corporation, purchaser, surviving or acquiring entity or the transferee in cash, securities
or other property (valued as provided in paragraph (d) of this Section B.1(iii)) an amount equal to
the Series A Preference Amount upon the occurrence of such Fundamental Change or Drag-Along
Sale: (1) the closing of the sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the
Corporation’s assets (including, but not limited to, the licensing of all or substantially all of the
intellectual property assets of the Corporation to one or more third parties), (2) the consummation
of a merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into another entity (except a merger or
consolidation in which the holders of capital stock of the Corporation immediately prior to such
merger or consolidation continue to hold at least 50% of the voting power of the capital stock of
the Corporation or the surviving or acquiring entity), or (3) the closing of the transfer (whether by
financing, merger, consolidation or otherwise), in one transaction or a series of related
transactions, to a person or group of affiliated persons (other than an underwriter of the
Corporation’s securities), of the Corporation’s securities if, after such closing and as a result of
such transaction(s), the Corporation’s shareholders before such event would own as a result of
their ownership of the Corporation’s secunties before such event fifty percent (50%) or less of the
Corporation’s voting securities after such event; provided, however, that a transaction shall not
constitute a Fundamental Change if its sole purpose is to change the state of the Corporation’s
incorporation or to create a holding company that will be owned in substantially the same
proportions by the persons who held the Corporation’s securities immediately prior to such
transaction. Notwithstanding the prior sentence, the sale of shares of Series A Preferred Stock in
a financing transaction shall not be deemed a “Fundamental Change”. The treatment of any
particular transaction or series of related transactions as a Fundamental Change may be waived by
the vote or written consent of the Supermajority Holders.

(c) In the event of a Dissolution Event, Fundamental Change treated as a
Dissolution Event under Section B.1(iii)(b) above, or Drag-Along Sale, then after the payment to
the holders of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock of the full Series A Preference Amount, the
remaining assets and funds of the Corporation, if any, including amounts paid to the Corporation
and/or shareholders upon the occurrence of such Fundamental Change or Drag-Along Sale, shall
be distributed among the holders of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Common Stock,
pro rata based on the number of shares of Common Stock held or deemed held by each such
holder, treating for this purpose all such securities as if they had been converted to Common
Stock pursuant to the terms of this Certificate of Incorporation immediately prior to such
Dissolution Event, Fundamental Change treated as a Dissolution Event under Section B.1(iii)(b)
above, or Drag-Along Sale.

(d) Whenever the distribution provided for in this Section B.1(iii) shall be
payable in securities or property other than cash, the value of such distribution shall be the Fair
Market Value of such securities or other property.

(e) Subject to paragraph (g) of this Section B. 1 (iii), ift

(1) shareholders (the “Accepting Shareholders”) holding not less than
66.67% of the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock have agreed to Transfer (as defined below) to
a Person (as defined below)) or Persons acting in concert (a “Purchaser”), all of their shares of
Series A Preferred Stock and Common Stock; and

(11) the Purchaser offers to each of the other shareholders (the “Forced
Shareholders”) to purchase the remaining securities of the Corporation (the “Specified

Securities”) on equivalent terms and conditions, mutatis mutandis, as those agreed to by the

Accepting Shareholders, all of which terms and conditions are set out in writing and promptly
delivered to the Forced Shareholders (the “Drag-Along Offer’),

the Forced Shareholders shall be required to sell all of their Specified Securities to the Purchaser
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Drag Along Offer except that the purchase
price shall be distributed among the selling shareholders in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c)
of this Section B.1 (iii).

(f) Upon acceptance of a Drag Along Offer the Accepting Shareholders shall
forthwith provide notice in writing (the “Drag Along Notice’) to the holders of Equity Securities
which are subject to the Drag Along Offer (the ‘Other Securityholders”) which specifies the name
of the Purchaser, the purchase prices, the intended closing date and place and all other material
terms and conditions of the intended sale. For purposes of this Section, “Equity Securities” shall
mean: (A) shares of any class in the share capital of the Corporation or any other security of the
Corporation that carries the residual right to participate in the earnings of the Corporation and, on
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, in the assets of the Corporation, whether or not the security
carries voting rights; (B) any Options (as defined below); or (C) any Convertible Securities (as
defined below).

(iv) Conversion. The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall have conversion
rights as follows:

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be
convertible, in whole or in part, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of
issuance of such share at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for such stock, into
such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion
Rate, determined as hereinafter provided, in effect on the date the certificate is surrendered for
conversion in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section B.1({iv). The Conversion Rate at
which shares of Common Stock shall be deliverable upon conversion of shares of the Series A
Preferred Stock shall initially be one. Such initial Conversion Rate shall be adjusted as
hereinafter provided.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall
automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the then-effective Conversion Rate
and such shares may not be reissued by the Corporation as shares of such series upon the earlier of
(A) the closing of the sale of the Corporation’s Common Stock in a firm commitment,
underwritten public offering registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
“Securities Act”), other than a registration relating solely to a transaction under Rule 145 under
the Securities Act (or any successor thereto), at a public offering price (prior to underwriters’
discounts and expenses) equal to or exceeding $1.662808 (as adjusted for any stock dividends,
combinations, reverse stock splits, stock splits, recapitalizations, reorganizations, reclassifications
or other similar event with respect to shares), and in which the aggregate proceeds to the
Corporation and/or any selling shareholders (prior to underwriters’ discounts and expenses) are at
least $25,000,000 (a “Qualified Public Offering”); or (B) prior written approval of the
Supermajonity Holders.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion.
(1) Before any holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
convert any of such shares into shares of Common Stock pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section

B.I(iv), such holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates evidencing such shares, duly
endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for such stock, and shall give

5
written notice to the Corporation at such office of the number of shares that such holder elects to
so convert. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter (but in any event within 20
business days thereafter), issue and deliver to such holder of Series A Preferred Stock a certificate
or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as
aforesaid and, if applicable, a certificate or certificates representing any such shares of Series A
Preferred Stock that are not being so converted (but were otherwise represented by a certificate
that included shares that were being so converted). Any such conversion shall be deemed to have
been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of surrender of the certificate or
certificates for the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons
entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for
all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date.

(11) In the event of an automatic conversion pursuant to paragraph
(b)(A) of this Section B.1(iv), the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering shares of
Series A Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of
the sale of securitics pursuant to such offering, in which event the person(s) entitled to receive the
Common Stock upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have
converted such Series A Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of
securities. No holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall receive certificates for shares of
Common Stock upon such conversion unless and until such holder shall surrender the certificate
or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for
such stock. Until surrendered as provided above, each certificate previously representing shares
of Series A Preferred Stock shall be deemed for all corporate purposes to represent the number of
shares of Common Stock resulting from such automatic conversion.

(d) Adjustments to Conversion Rate for Certain Diluting Issues.

(1) Special Definitions. For purposes of this Section B.1, the

(1) “Qptions”’ shall mean options, warrants and rights entitling

2 oe

“Transferring”, ‘“Transferor”, ““Transferee” and similar words have corresponding meanings.

(II} No Adjustment of Conversion Rate. Any provision of this
Certificate of Incorporation to the contrary notwithstanding, no adjustment in the Conversion Rate
shall be made in respect of the issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock or deemed
issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock unless the consideration per share (determined
pursuant to subparagraph (d)(V) of this Section B.1(iv)) for an Additional Share of Common
Stock issued or deemed to be issued by the Corporation is less than the Original Issue Price (as
adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, reverse stock splits, stock splits, recapitalizations,
reorganizations, reclassifications or other similar event with respect to shares).

(Il) Deemed Issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock. Except
as otherwise excluded under Section B.1(iv)(d)(I)(4), in the event the Corporation at any time or
from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall issue any Options or Convertible Securities or
shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities then entitled to
receive any such Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of shares (as set
forth in the instrument relating thercto without regard to any provisions contained therein
designed to protect against dilution) of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Options
or, in the case of Convertible Securities and Options for Convertible Securities, the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to be Additional Shares of Common
Stock issued as of the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of
the close of business on such record date, provided that in any such case in which Additional
Shares of Common Stock are deemed to be issued:

(1) no further adjustments in the Conversion Rate shall be
made upon the subsequent issue of such Convertible Securities where an adjustment to the
Conversion Rate had been made on the record date, or shares of Common Stock upon the exercise
of such Options or conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, in each case where an
adjustment to the Conversion Rate had been made on the record date or issue date;

(2) if such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms
provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any increase or decrease in the consideration
payable to the Corporation, or decrease or increase in the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable, upon the exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, the Conversion Rate computed upon
the original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and any
subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon any such increase or decrease becoming
effective, be recomputed to reflect such increase or decrease insofar as it affects such Options or
the rights of conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities (provided, however, that
no such adjustment of the Conversion Rate shall affect Common Stock previously issued upon
conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock);

(3) upon the expiration of any such Options or any rights of
conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have been exercised,
the Conversion Rate computed upon the original issuance thereof (or upon the occurrence of a
record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon such
expiration, be recomputed as if:

(A) _ in the case of Options or Convertible Securities for
Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common Stock issued were the shares of Common
Stock, if any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of
such Convertible Securities and the consideration received therefor was the consideration actually
received by the Corporation for the issue of all such Options, whether or not exercised, plus the
consideration actually received by the Corporation upon such exercise or for the issue of all such
Convertible Securities which were actually converted or exchanged, plus the additional
consideration, if any, actually received by the Corporation upon such conversion or exchange, and

(B) in the case of Options for Convertible Securities,
only the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were issued at the
time of issue of such Options, and the consideration received by the Corporation for the
Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been then issued was the consideration
actually received by the Corporation for the issue of all such Options, whether or not exercised,
plus the consideration deemed to have been received by the Corporation (determined pursuant to
subparagraph (d)(V) of this Section B.1(iv)) upon the issue of the Convertible Securities with
respect to which such Options were actually exercised;
(4) no readjustment pursuant to clause (2) or (3) above shall
have the effect of increasing the Conversion Rate to an amount which exceeds the lower of (a) the
Conversion Rate on the original adjustment date, or (b) the Conversion Rate that resulted from
any issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock, other than those Additional Shares of
Common Stock causing such readjustment, between the original adjustment date and such
readjustment date;

(5) in the case of any Options which expire by their terms not
more than 30 days after the date of issue thereof, no adjustment of the Conversion Rate shall be
made until the expiration or exercise of all such Options, whereupon such adjustment shall be
made in the same manner provided in clause (3) above; and

(6) in the event that any adjustment described in this
subparagraph (d)(III) is made, with respect to any Additional Shares of Common Stock that were
originally issued (or deemed issued) for a consideration per share equal to or in excess of the
Original Issue Price (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, reverse stock splits, stock
splits, recapitalizations, reorganizations, reclassifications or other similar event with respect to
shares) that, had such adjustment been made prior to such original issue date (or deemed original
issue date) would have caused such Additional Shares of Common Stock to be issued for a
consideration per share less than the Original Issue Price (as adjusted for any stock dividends,
combinations, reverse stock splits, stock splits, recapitalizations, reorganizations, reclassifications
or other similar event with respect to shares) then in effect, then such Additional Shares of
Common Stock shal! be deemed to have been issued as of the date of any such adjustment.

(IV) Adjustment of Conversion Rate Upon Issuance of Additional
Shares of Common Stock. In the event the Corporation, at any time after the Original Issue Date,
shall issue Additional Shares of Common Stock (including Additional Shares of Common Stock
deemed to be issued pursuant to subparagraph (d)(III) of this Section B.I{iv)) without
consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Original Issue Price (as adjusted for
any stock dividends, combinations, reverse stock splits, stock splits, recapitalizations,
reorganizations, reclassifications or other similar event with respect to shares), then and in such
event, the Conversion Rate shall be increased, concurrently with such issue, in accordance with
the following formula:

CR = (A * (B+D))/(A*B + C*D)
For purposes of the foregoing formula, the following definitions shall apply:

(1) CR shall mean the Conversion Rate in effect immediately
after such issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock;

(2) “A” shall mean the Original Issue Price per share (as
adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, reverse stock splits, stock splits, recapitalizations,
reorganizations, reclassifications or other similar event with respect to shares);

(3) ‘“B” shall mean the fully-diluted number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue;

. (4) “C” shall mean the consideration per share to be paid for
the Additional Shares of Common Stock issued in such transaction: and
(5) “PD” shall mean the number of such Additional Shares of
Common Stock issued in such transaction.

(V) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of paragraph (d) of
this Section B.1(iv), the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional
Shares of Common Stock shall be computed as follows:

(1) Cash and Property. Such consideration shall:

(A) _ insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
agpregate amount of cash received by the Corporation excluding amounts paid or payable for
accrued interest or accrued dividends;

(B) _ insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the Fair Market Value thereof at the time of such issue; and

(C) in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock
are issued together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for
consideration which covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed
as provided in clauses (A) and (B) above.

(2) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per
share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been
issued pursuant to subparagraph (d)(III) of this Section B.I(iv), relating to Options and
Convertible Securities shall be determined by dividing:

(A) _ the total amount, if any, received or receivable by
the Corporation as consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the
minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating
thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein designed to protect against dilution)
payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of
such Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of
such Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities by

(B) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock
(as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein
designed to protect against dilution) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities.

(e) Adjustments to Conversion Rates for Stock Dividends and for
Combinations or Subdivisions of Common Stock, \n the event that the Corporation at any time or
from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall declare or pay, without consideration, any
dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock or in any right to acquire
shares of Common Stock for no consideration, or shall effect a subdivision of the outstanding
shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares of Common Stock (by stock split,
reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock or in any
right to acquire shares of Common Stock), or in the event the outstanding shares of Common
Stock shall be combined or consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of
shares of Common Stock, then the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to such event
shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such event, be proportionately decreased or increased,
as appropriate. In the event that the Corporation shall declare or pay, without consideration, any

10
dividend on the Common Stock payable in any right to acquire shares of Common Stock for no
consideration, then the Corporation shal! be deemed to have made a dividend payable in shares of
Common Stock in an amount equal to the maximum number of shares issuable upon exercise of
such rights to acquire Common Stock.

(f) Adjustments for Reclassification and Reorganization. lf the Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or
a different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock, whether by capital
reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares
provided for in paragraph (e) of this Section B.1(iv) above or a merger or other reorganization
referred to in paragraph (b) of Section B.1(iii) above), the Conversion Rate then in effect shall,
concurrently with the effectiveness of such reorganization or reclassification, be proportionately
adjusted so that the Series A Preferred Stock shall thereafter be convertible into, in lieu of the
number of shares of Common Stock which the holders would otherwise have been entitled to
receive, a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock equivalent to the number of
shares of Common Stock that would have been received by the holders upon conversion of the
Series A Preferred Stock immediately before that change.

(g) No Impairment. The Corporation will not, by amendment of its Certificate
of Incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger,
dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the
observance of performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the
Corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this
Section B.1(iv) and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to
protect the Conversion Rate against impairment.

(h) Certificates as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Conversion Rate pursuant to this Section B.I(iv), the Corporation at its
expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms
hereof and prepare and furnish to each holder of Series A Preferred Stock a certificate executed by
the Corporation’s President or Chief Executive Officer setting forth such adjustment or
readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is
based. The Corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any such holder, furnish or
cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and
readjustments, (ii) the Conversion Rate at the time in effect, and (iii) the number of shares of
Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received
upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock.

(i) Notices of Record Date. In the event that the Corporation shall propose at
any time prior to the conversion of all outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock: (I) to
declare any dividend or distribution upon its Common Stock, whether in cash, property, stock or
other securities, whether or not a regular cash dividend and whether or not out of earnings or
earned surplus; (II) to offer for subscription pro rata to the holders of any class or series of its
stock any additional shares of stock of any class or series or other rights; (III) to effect any
reclassification or recapitalization of its Common Stock outstanding involving a change in the
Common Stock; or (IV) to merge or consolidate with or into any other corporation, or sell, lease
or convey all or substantially all of its assets, or to liquidate, dissolve or wind-up; then, in

connection with each such event, the Corporation shall send to the holders of Series A Preferred
tock:

qd) at least twenty (20) days’ prior written notice of the date on which
a record shall be taken for such dividend, distribution or subscription rights (and specifying the

ll
date on which the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled thereto) or for determining rights to
vote, if any, in respect of the matters referred to in clauses (1) and (II) above; and

(2) in the case of the matters referred to in clauses (III) and (IV)
above, at least twenty (20) days’ prior written notice of the date when the same shall take place
(and specifying the date on which the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to exchange
their Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon the occurrence of such
event).

Qj) Issue Taxes. The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and other taxes
that may be payable in respect of any issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock on conversion
of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant hereto; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be
obligated to pay any transfer taxes resulting from any transfer requested by any holder in
connection with any such conversion.

(k) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at
all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock,
solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock,
such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such
corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but
unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such
purpose, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite shareholder
approval of any necessary amendment to this Certificate of Incorporation.

(1) Fractional Shares. No fractional share shall be issued upon the
conversion of any share or shares of Series A Preferred Stock. All shares of Common Stock
(including fractions thereof) issuable upon conversion of more than one share of Series A
Preferred Stock by a holder thereof shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the
conversion would result in the issuance of any fractional share. If, after the aforementioned
aggregation, the conversion would result in the issuance of a fraction of a share of Common
Stock, the Corporation shall, in lieu of issuing any fractional share, pay the holder otherwise
entitled to such fraction a sum in cash equal to the Fair Market Value of such fraction on the date
of conversion.

(m) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Section B.1{iv) to
be given to the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, unless waived by the holder, shall be
deemed given if deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, or if sent by facsimile or
delivered personally by hand or nationally recognized courier and addressed to each holder of
record at such holder’s address or facsimile number appearing in the records of the Corporation.

(v) Voting.
(a) Series A Preferred Stock.
(1) Special Definition: For purposes of Section B.1(ii)(b) and Section

B.1(v), and in addition to the definitions set forth in paragraph (d) of Section B.1(iv), the
following definition applies:

12
(1) “As-If-Converted Basis” shall mean at any time that all
shares of any class in the share capital of the Corporation issued and outstanding at that time
which are convertible into Common Stock will be deemed to have been fully converted, in
accordance with the rights, privileges, restrictions and conditions attached thereto, into shares of
Common Stock and that all shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to such convertible shares
will be deemed to have been issued and to form part of the holdings of the Person(s) entitled to
receive such shares of Common Stock.

(II) Voting of Series A Preferred Stock: At any meeting of the
shareholders of the Corporation, the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to the
number of votes for each such share held that would equal the number of shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of such shares on the record date for the meeting. The shares of
the Series A Preferred Stock (on an As-If-Converted Basis) and the Common Stock shall vote

together as a single class of stock, except where voting separately by class or series is required by
the DGCL.

(b) Supermajority Approval Required. Without the prior written approval of
the Supermajority Holders, the Corporation shall not take any of the following actions:

(i) authorize any action or take or institute proceedings in furtherance
of the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary,
or other distribution of assets of the Corporation among its shareholders for the purpose of
winding-up its affairs;

(ii) | authorize any action or take or institute proceedings in furtherance
of (a) any Fundamental Change, (b) amalgamation, merger, plan of arrangement or consolidation
with any other entity; or (c) the acquisition by the Corporation or any subsidiary of any securities,

(iii) | approve any change in the rights or preferences of the any class of

amend any existing stock option plan or stock purchase plan or arrangement to increase the
number of Options or other securities available for issuance thereunder;

(vi) | redeem or acquire any securities of the Corporation other than (x)
pursuant to Section B.1(ii) of this Article Fourth, or (y) the repurchase of shares of Common
Stock owned by an employee, director or consultant to the Corporation pursuant to an
arrangement which was previously approved by the Board of Directors;

(vii) authorize or issue, or obligate itself to authorize or issue, any other

equity security having any preference or priority over, or ranking senior to or on parity with, the
Series A Preferred Stock; or

13
(vili) engage in any recapitalization or reorganization of the Corporation
or otherwise reclassify any shares of Common Stock, Series A Preferred Stock or any other
securities of the Corporation, or engage in any financing requiring the granting of security over
any of the material assets of the Corporation (including its intellectual property).

Cc. Terms of Common Stock. The voting powers and relative, participating, optional and
other special rights of the Common Stock, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions
thereof, are as follows:

1. Voting Rights and Powers. Except as provided in the DGCL, the holders of shares of
the Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote per each share of Common Stock and shall vote
together as a single class (with the holders of Series A Preferred Stock entitled to vote together
with the holders of the shares of Common Stock) on all matters as to which such holders are
entitled to vote.

2. Dividend Rights. Cash or other types of dividends (other than fixed dividends) may be
declared and paid upon the Common Stock so long as (i) there are no Series A Preferred Stock or
other securities ranking prior to the Common Stock upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up of
the Corporation outstanding or (ii) such dividends are declared and paid upon the Series A
Preferred Stock at the same time and in the same amount as the Common Stock. In determining
the amount of the dividend per share, the Series A Preferred Stock shall be on an As-If-Converted
Basis. Thereafter, dividends may be declared and paid upon the Common Stock in such amounts
and at such times as the Board of Directors may determine. Funds otherwise legally available for
the payment of dividends on the Common Stock shall not be restricted or reduced by reason of
there being any excess of the aggregate preferential amount of Series A Preferred Stock
outstanding over the aggregate par value thereof.

3. Liquidation Rights. In the event of any Dissolution Event, after there shall have been
paid or set apart for payment of holders of any outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock the
full preferential amounts to which they are entitled under Section B.1 (iii) the remaining assets and
funds of the Corporation, if any, shall be distributed among the holders of the shares of Series A
Preferred Stock and Common Stock, pro rata based on the number of shares of Common Stock
held or deemed held by each such holder, treating for this purpose all such securities as if they had
been converted to Common Stock pursuant to the terms of this Certificate of Incorporation
immediately prior to such Dissolution Event.

4, Preemptive Rights. The holders of Common Stock shall have no preemptive rights.

FIFTH. All corporate powers of the Corporation shall be exercised by or under the direction of
the Board of Directors except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable law. In furtherance
and not in limitation of the powers conferred by law, the Board of Directors is expressly
authorized:

(i) to adopt, amend or repeal By-laws of the Corporation, subject to the right of the
shareholders of the Corporation entitled to vote with respect thereto to adopt By-laws and to
amend or repeal By-laws made by the Board of Directors; and

(ii) from time to time to determine whether and to what extent, at what time and place,
and under what conditions and regulations the accounts and books of the Corporation, or any of
them, shall be open to the inspection of any shareholder; and no shareholder shall have any right
to inspect any account or book or document of the Corporation except as provided by applicable

14
law or the By-laws of the Corporation, as authorized by resolution of the shareholders or Board of
Directors of the Corporation or as set forth in any agreement among the Corporation and any of its
shareholders.

SIXTH. No present or former director or officer of the Corporation or any person acting at the
direction of the Board of Directors shall be personally liable to the Corporation or its shareholders
for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer; provided, however, that
this Article shall not be deemed to eliminate or limit a director’s or officer’s liability to the extent
provided by applicable law (i) for any breach of the director’s or officer’s duty of loyalty to the
Corporation or its shareholders; (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve
intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of the law; (iii) under Section 174 of Title 8 of the
DGCL,; or (iv) for any transaction from which the director or officer derived an improper personal
benefit. If the DGCL is amended after adoption by the Corporation of this Article to authorize
corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors or officers, then
the liability of a director or officer of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest
extent permitted by the DGCL, as so amended. Neither the amendment nor the repeal of this
Article, nor the adoption of any provision to this Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this
Article, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article in respect of any matter occurring, or
any cause of action, suit or claim that, but for this Article, would accrue or arise prior to such
amendment or repeal of this Article or prior to the adoption of an inconsistent provision.

SEVENTH.

A. Every person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in
any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that such person or a person of whom such
person is a legal representative is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation or for its benefit as a director, officer, employee or agent
of any other corporation, or as the representative of the Corporation in a partnership, joint venture,
trust or other entity, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest
extent legally permissible under the DGCL, as amended from time to time, against all expenses,
liabilities and losses (including attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid or to be paid in
settlement) reasonably paid or incurred by such person in connection therewith. Such right of
indemnification shall be a contract right that may be enforced in any manner desired by such
person. Such right of indemnification shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the
expenses incurred in defending any such action, suit or proceeding in advance of its final
disposition upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay such amount if
ultimately it should be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the
Corporation under the DGCL. Such right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other
right which such directors, officers or representatives may have or hereafter acquire and, without
limiting the generality of such statement, they shall be entitled to their respective rights of
indemnification under any By-law, agreement, vote of shareholders, provision of law or
otherwise, as well as their rights under this Article Seventh.

B. The Board of Directors may adopt By-laws from time to time with respect to
indemnification to provide at all times the fullest indemnification permitted by the DGCL, as
amended from time to time, and may cause the Corporation to purchase and maintain insurance on
behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is
or was serving at the request of the Corporation or for its benefit as a director, officer, employee
or agent of any other corporation, or as the representative of the Corporation in a partnership, joint

15
venture, trust or other entity, against any expense, liability or loss asserted against or incurred by
any such person in any such capacity or arising out of any such status, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or
loss.

EIGHTH. Except as other as otherwise provided in this Certificate of Incorporation, the
Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this
Certificate of Incorporation in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights
conferred upon shareholders, directors and officers herein are granted subject to this reservation.

NINTH. The number of years the corporation is to continue is perpetual.
TENTH. The number of directors to constitute the Board of Directors shall be seven (7).

ELEVENTH. Elections of directors need not be by written ballot unless the by-laws of the
Corporation shall so provide.

TWELFTH. Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed between the Corporation and
its creditors or any class of them, and/or between the Corporation and its shareholders or any class
of them, any court of equitable jurisdiction within the State of Delaware may, on the application
in a summary way of the Corporation or of any creditor or shareholder thereof or on the
application of any receiver or receivers appointed for this Corporation under the provisions of
Section 291 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code or on the application of trustees in dissolution or of
any receiver or receivers appointed for this Corporation under the provisions of Section 279 of
Title 8 of the Delaware Code, order a meeting of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the
shareholders or class of shareholders of the Corporation, as the case may be, to be summoned in
such manner as the said court directs. If a majority in number representing three-fourths in value
of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the shareholders or class of shareholders of the
Corporation, as the case may be, agree to any compromise or arrangement and to any
reorganization of the Corporation as a consequence of such compromise or arrangement, the said
compromise or arrangement and the said reorganization shall, if sanctioned by the court to which
the said application has been made, be binding on all the creditors or class of creditors, and/or on
all the shareholders or class of shareholders, of this Corporation, as the case may be, and also on
the Corporation.

THIRTEENTH. Pursuant to Section 122(17) of the DGCL, but except as otherwise set forth in
this ARTICLE THIRTEENTH, the Corporation hereby renounces any interest or expectancy of
the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation in, or in being offered an opportunity to
participate in, any and all business opportunities that are presented to the Investors (as defined in
the Shareholders’ Agreement) or their affiliates. As used in this ARTICLE THIRTEENTH, the
term “Investor Party” shall include each such Investor and any representative or affiliate of such
Investor, including a representative or affiliate serving on the Board of Directors, but shall not
include any Investor who (or whose representative or affiliate) is otherwise employed by the
Corporation. If any such Investor Party acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter
(other than in connection with service on the Board of Directors) that may be an investment or
business opportunity or prospective economic or competitive advantage in which the Corporation
could have an interest or expectancy (a “Corporate Opportunity’) or otherwise is then exploiting
any Corporate Opportunity, the Corporation shall have no interest in, and no expectation that,
such Corporate Opportunity be offered to it, any such interest or expectation being hereby

16
renounced so that the Investor Parties (a) shall have (i) no duty to communicate or present such
Corporate Opportunity to the Corporation and (ii) the right to hold any such Corporate
Opportunity for the Investor’s own account and benefit or to recommend, assign or otherwise
transfer such Corporate Opportunity to any individual or entity other than the Corporation, and (b)
to the fullest extent permitted by law cannot be, and shall not be, liable to the Corporation or its
shareholders for breach of any fiduciary duty as a shareholder or director of the Corporation by
reason of the fact that an Investor pursues or acquires such Corporate Opportunity or
recommends, assigns or otherwise transfers such Corporate Opportunity to an individual or entity
other than the Corporation; provided, however, that each director of the Corporation shall act in
good faith and provided further, that nothing in this Article shall change a director’s duties or
obligations with respect to proprietary or confidential information of the Corporation or prohibit
the Corporation from pursuing any Corporate Opportunity. In addition, a Corporate Opportunity
shall belong to the Corporation if such Corporate Opportunity is offered to an individual directly
in connection with such individual’s service as a director of the Corporation.

Signed this 23 day of March 2007.
