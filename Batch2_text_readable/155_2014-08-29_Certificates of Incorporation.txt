The following is a statement of the designations and the powers, privileges and rights, and the
qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof in respect of each class of capital stock of the
Corporation.

A. COMMON STOCK.

1. General. The voting, dividend and liquidation rights of the holders of the
Common Stock are subject to and qualified by the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock as
may be designated by the Board of Directors upon any issuance of the Preferred Stock of any
series.

2. Voting. The holders of the Common Stock are entitled to one vote for
each share of Common Stock held at all meetings of stockholders (and actions by written consent
of the stockholders in lieu of meetings) with respect to any and all matters presented to the
stockholders of the Corporation for their action or consideration. There shall be no cumulative
voting.

3. Number of Shares. Subject to any other votes required as set forth herein,
the number of authorized shares of Common Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below
the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote, irrespective of the provisions of
Section 242(b)(2) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.

4, Dividends. Dividends may be declared and paid on the Common Stock
from funds lawfully available therefor if, as and when determined by the Board of Directors and
subject to any preferential dividend rights of any then outstanding Preferred Stock.

5. Liquidation. Upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary (a “Liquidation Event”), or upon an event
described in Section B.2(f) of this Article Fourth that is deemed to be a Liquidation Event, the
holders of Common Stock will be entitled to receive all assets of the Corporation available for
distribution to its stockholders, subject to any preferential rights of any then outstanding
Preferred Stock.

B. PREFERRED STOCK.

1. Dividends. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive,
in preference to the holders of the Junior Stock (as defined in Section B.2(a) below), out of funds
legally available therefor, if, as and when declared by the Corporation’s Board of Directors, cash
dividends annually at a rate equal to the greater of (i) eight percent (8%) per annum multiplied
by the original purchase price per share paid to the Corporation by the initial holder of such
share, and (ii) the dividends payable on the Common Stock into which such shares of Preferred
Stock would have been converted, had such shares of Preferred Stock been converted into shares
of Common Stock on the record date for the dividend (the “Dividend Rate”). Such dividends
shall not be cumulative. Unless all declared dividends on the Preferred Stock shall have been
paid or a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart, no dividend shall be paid or declared,
and no distribution shall be made, on any Junior Stock and no redemption of any Junior Stock
shall occur. Except as otherwise provided herein, if at any time the Corporation pays less than
the total amount of dividends then declared but unpaid with respect to the Preferred Stock, such
payment shall be distributed ratably among the holders of Preferred Stock in proportion to the
payment each such holder would receive if the full amount of such dividend were paid. Upon
any conversion of shares of Preferred Stock, all rights to such preferential dividends (whether or
not declared) on such shares shall terminate.

The original purchase price per share for each series of Preferred Stock for the purpose of
calculating dividends, and for all other purposes of this Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, is as follows (with all per share figures subject to appropriate adjustment in the
event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization affecting

then outstanding (and which have not been surrendered for conversion as provided in

Distributable Amount”), before any payment shall be made to the holders of Common Stock or
any other class or series of stock ranking on liquidation junior to the Preferred Stock (such
Common Stock and other stock being collectively referred to as “Junior Stock”) by reason of
their ownership thereof, the amount determined pursuant to subsections (b), (c), (d), (€), (H
and/or (z) below, as applicable, plus any dividends declared but unpaid on such shares, based on
a per share amount (the “Initial Calculation”) determined by dividing the Total Distributable
Amount by the total number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding, calculated in all cases
assuming conversion of all Preferred Stock into Common Stock and assuming all that shares of
Common Stock underlying options, warrants and other securities convertible into or
exchangeable for Common Stock or Preferred Stock that are to be acquired by the acquirer in the
Liquidation Event are issued and outstanding.

(b) If the Initial Calculation is greater than or equal to five times the
Series G Original Purchase Price, then the Total Distributable Amount shall be distributed
among the holders of shares of Preferred Stock, Common Stock and any other class or series of
stock entitled to participate in liquidation distributions with the holders of Common Stock, pro

Preferred Stock, then the lesser amount that is available for distribution will be distributed
among the holders of Series F Preferred Stock pro rata.

entitled to participate in liquidation distributions with the holders of Common Stock, pro rata
based on the number of shares of Common Stock held by each (assuming conversion into
Common Stock of all such shares of any other class or series of stock).

(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections B.2(a) through (d) of
this Article Fourth, in the event the amount distributable to the Corporation’s stockholders in
connection with a Liquidation Event is payable in installments (whether by reason of earnouts,
escrow, holdbacks or otherwise), then prior to the time a distribution (the “Current Distribution”)
is to be made, the total amount available for the Current Distribution will be cumulated with all
prior distributions made in connection with the Liquidation Event, and a calculation of the
amount distributable to each stockholder will be made as if the total cumulative amount had been
paid in a single initial distribution, assuming for purposes of such calculation that each series of
Preferred Stock elected to convert such series of Preferred Stock to Common Stock in a manner
that would yield such series of Preferred Stock the largest distribution. The amount allocated to
each stockholder in such calculation is called the stockholder’s “Cumulative Distribution.” In
the Current Distribution, each stockholder will receive an amount such that when the portion of
the Current Distribution distributed to such stockholder is added to all prior distributions to such
stockholder in connection with the Liquidation Event, such stockholder will have received its
Cumulative Distribution.

(f) In the event of any merger or consolidation of the Corporation into
or with another corporation (except one in which the holders of capital stock of the Corporation
immediately prior to such merger or consolidation continue to hold at least seventy percent
(70%) by voting power of the capital stock of the surviving corporation), the sale of all of the
outstanding capital stock of the Corporation to a single entity or group of related entities in one
transaction or a series of transactions or the sale of all or substantially all the assets of the
Corporation, such merger, consolidation, stock sale or asset sale shall be deemed to be a
Liquidation Event and all consideration payable to the stockholders of the Corporation (in case
of a merger, consolidation or stock sale) or all consideration payable to the Corporation, together
with all other available assets of the Corporation (in case of an asset sale), shall be distributed to
the holders of capital stock of the Corporation in accordance with Sections B.2(a) through (e) of
this Article Fourth, unless the holders of at least fifty percent (50%) of the then outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock elect not to treat such event as a Liquidation Event by giving written
notice thereof to the Corporation at least three (3) days before the effective date of such event.
The Corporation shall promptly provide to the holders of shares of Preferred Stock such
information concerning the terms of such merger, consolidation, stock sale or asset sale and the
value of the assets of the Corporation as may reasonably be requested by the holders of Preferred
Stock in order to assist them in determining whether to make such an election. The Corporation
shall use its best efforts to ensure that the agreement or plan of merger or consolidation applies a
rate at which the shares of capital stock of the Corporation are converted into or exchanged for
cash, new securities or other property to give effect to Sections B.2(a) through (e) of this Article
Fourth. In any Liquidation Event, if the proceeds received by the Corporation or its stockholders
are comprised of any combination of cash, promissory notes, securities and/or other property
(each, a “Form of Proceeds”), then pro rata distributions of each Form of Proceeds shall be made
in such priority and amounts as required to satisfy the distribution requirements specified in
Section B.2(a) through (e) of this Article Fourth. The amount deemed distributed to the holders
of Preferred Stock upon any such merger or consolidation shall be the cash or the value of the
property, rights or securities distributed to such holders by the acquiring person, firm or other
entity. The value of such property, rights or other securities shall be determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors of the Corporation and the holders of a majority of the Preferred Stock,
provided that if the property is securities that are traded on a securities exchange, the Nasdaq
Stock Market or over-the-counter, the value of the securities shall be deemed to be the average of
the closing prices (with respect to securities listed on a securities exchange or the Nasdaq Stock
Market) or the closing bid and ask prices (with respect to securities listed over-the-counter) of
the securities on such exchange or over-the-counter over the ten (10) day period ending three (3)
days prior to the closing of the transaction which will constitute a liquidation of the Corporation.

(2) In a Liquidation Event, if any portion of the consideration payable
to the stockholders of the Corporation is payable only upon satisfaction of contingencies (the
“Additional Consideration”), the applicable sale agreement shall provide that (a) the portion of
such consideration that is not Additional Consideration (such portion, the “Initial
Consideration”) shall be allocated among the holders of capital stock of the Corporation in
accordance with the above liquidation provisions as if the Initial Consideration were the only
consideration payable in connection with such Liquidation Event; and (b) any Additional
Consideration which becomes payable to the stockholders of the Corporation upon satisfaction of
such contingencies shall be allocated among the holders of capital stock of the Corporation in
accordance with the above liquidation provisions after taking into account the previous payment
of the Initial Consideration as part of the same transaction. Consideration placed into escrow or
retained as holdback to be available for satisfaction of indemnification or similar obligations in
connection with such Liquidation Event shall be deemed to be Additional Consideration.

10
(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if a share of
Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series B-1 Preferred Stock, Series C
Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock, Series F Preferred Stock or
Series G Preferred Stock would receive a greater amount per share if all such shares of Series A
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series B-1 Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock,
Series D Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock, Series F Preferred Stock or Series G
Preferred Stock, as applicable, had been converted into Common Stock immediately prior to the
Liquidation Event, then each such applicable share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be paid
on an as-converted to Common Stock basis in lieu of receiving the lesser liquidation amounts set
forth above.

3. Voting.

(a) General. Each holder of outstanding shares of Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of whole shares of Common Stock
into which the shares of Preferred Stock held by such holder are then convertible (as adjusted
from time to time pursuant to Section B.4 of this Article Fourth), at each meeting of stockholders
of the Corporation (and actions by written consent of the stockholders in lieu of meetings) with
respect to any and all matters presented to the stockholders of the Corporation for their action or
consideration. There shall be no cumulative voting. Except as provided by law, by the
provisions of Section B.7 hereof or by the provisions establishing any other series of preferred
stock, holders of Preferred Stock and of any other outstanding series of preferred stock shall vote
together with the holders of Common Stock as a single class.

(b) Size of Board_of Directors. Unless increased or decreased in

Preferred Stock, each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of the holder
thereof, at any time and from time to time, and without the payment of additional consideration
by the holder thereof, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock
as is determined by dividing the Original Purchase Price for the applicable series of Preferred
Stock by its Conversion Price (as defined below) in effect at the time of conversion. ‘The initial
“Conversion Price” shall be the Series A Original Purchase Price for the Series A Preferred
Stock, the Series B Original Purchase Price for the Series B Preferred Stock, the Series B-1
Original Purchase Price for the Series B-1 Preferred Stock, the Series C Original Purchase Price

In the event of a notice of redemption of any shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to
Section B.6 of this Article Fourth, the conversion rights of the shares designated for redemption
shall terminate at the close of business on the fifth (Sth) full day preceding the date fixed for
redemption, unless the redemption price is not paid when due, in which case the conversion
rights for such shares shall continue until such price is paid in full. In the event of a liquidation
of the Corporation, the conversion rights shall terminate at the close of business on the first (1st)
full day immediately preceding the date fixed for the payment of any amounts distributable on
liquidation to the holders of Preferred Stock.

(b) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be
issued upon conversion of the Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the
holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay to such holder an amount equal to
such fraction multiplied by the fair market value of the Common Stock as determined in good
faith by the Corporation’s Board of Directors.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion.

(i) If a holder of Preferred Stock elects to convert shares of
Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section B.4(a) above, such holder
shall surrender the certificate or certificates for such shares of Preferred Stock at the principal
office of the Corporation together with written notice that such holder elects to convert all or any
number of the shares of the Preferred Stock represented by such certificate or certificates. Such
notice shall state such holder’s name or the names of the nominees in which such holder wishes
the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued and the effective date of
the conversion (the “Conversion Date”), which may be any date within the sixty (60) day period
following the date on which such notice is received by the Corporation. If required by the
Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by a
written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly
executed by the registered holder or such holder’s attorney duly authorized in writing. The
converting holder shall be deemed to be the record holder of the resulting shares of Common
Stock on the Conversion Date and the Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after the
Conversion Date (and in any event within fifteen (15) business days), issue and deliver at such
office of such holder of Preferred Stock, or to such holder’s nominees, a certificate or certificates
for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled, together with
payment in lieu of any fraction of a share pursuant to Section B.4(b) above.

(ii) | The Corporation shall at all times when the Preferred Stock
shall be outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued stock, for the
purpose of effecting the conversion of the Preferred Stock, such number of its duly authorized
shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all
outstanding Preferred Stock. Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment
reducing the Conversion Price below the then par value of the shares of Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation will, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary
in order that the Corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion Price.

(iii) Upon any such conversion, no adjustment to the
Conversion Price shall be made for any declared or accrued but unpaid dividends on the
Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion or on the Common Stock delivered upon conversion.

(iv) On the Conversion Date, all shares of Preferred Stock
which shall have been surrendered for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed
to be outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares, including the rights, if any, to receive
notices and to vote, shall immediately cease and terminate, except only the right of the holders
thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor and payment of any dividends
declared but unpaid thereon. Any shares of Preferred Stock so converted shall be retired and
cancelled and shal! not be reissued, and the Corporation (without the need for stockholder action)
may from thereafter take such appropriate action as may be necessary to reduce the authorized
Preferred Stock accordingly.

(v) The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and other taxes
(other than taxes based on income) that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of
shares of Common Stock upon conversion of shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this
Section B.4.. The Corporation shall not, however, be required to pay any tax which may be
payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of shares of Common
Stock in a name other than that in which the shares of Preferred Stock so converted were
registered, and no such issuance or delivery shall be made unless and until the person or entity
requesting such issuance has paid to the Corporation the amount of any such tax or has
established, to the satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax has been paid.

(d) Adjustment for Dilution. If at any time after the date of the filing
of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware (the “Filing Date”), the Corporation shall issue any shares of Common Stock, or
shall issue any Common Stock Equivalents (as hereinafter defined), for a consideration per share
less than the Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to the
issuance of such Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents, the Conversion Price of such
series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall be decreased to
the amount determined in accordance with the following formula:

Conversion Price = (P} x Q1) +(P2 x Q?)
Ql + Q2

For purposes of the foregoing formula:

Pl = Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance.
Ql = Number of shares of Common Stock deemed outstanding (in
accordance with subparagraph (vi) below) immediately prior to such

issuance.

p2 = Average price per share received by the Corporation upon such
issuance (determined in accordance with subparagraphs (iii) and (vi)
below).

Q2 = Number of shares of Common Stock issued or sold, or deemed to

have been issued or sold (in accordance with subparagraph (vi)
below) upon such issuance.

For purposes of any adjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section B.4(d), the
following provisions shall be applicable:

(i) “Common Stock Equivalents” means any stock or security
convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock, including the Preferred
Stock, and any right, warrant or option to acquire Common Stock or any such convertible,
exercisable or exchangeable security, provided, that the term Common Stock Equivalents shall
not include any rights, warrants or options to acquire Common Stock where the exercise or
“strike” price, or other amount payable in connection with the exercise or exchange of such
security, exceeds the fair market value of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such
exercise.

(il) The per share consideration for the sale or issuance of
Common Stock shall be the price per share received by the Corporation before payment of
commissions, discounts and other expenses. The value of any non-cash consideration received
or receivable upon the sale or issuance of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents shall be
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

(it) In the case of the sale or issuance of Common Stock
Equivalents, the per share consideration shall be determined by dividing the maximum number
of shares of Common Stock issuable with respect to such Common Stock Equivalents into the
aggregate consideration received by the Corporation upon the sale or issuance of such Common
Stock Equivalents plus the minimum aggregate amount of any additional consideration
receivable by the Corporation upon the conversion or exercise of such Common Stock
Equivalents. For the purpose of calculation, such maximum number of shares shall be assumed
to be issued on the earlier of the payment date or record date for a distribution of such Common
Stock Equivalents.

(iv) If any Common Stock Equivalents included in adjustments
under this Section B.4(d) expire or terminate without the Common Stock to which they related
having been issued, the Conversion Price shall be readjusted to eliminate the effect of the
assumed issuance of such Common Stock. If any Common Stock Equivalents by their terms
provide for subsequent increases in the additional consideration payable for the related Common
Stock or for subsequent decreases in the number of shares of Common Stock obtainable, then,
upon any such increase or decrease, the Conversion Price shall be appropriately readjusted to the
extent such Common Stock Equivalents have not then expired or been exercised or converted.
The aggregate increase in the Conversion Price caused by all such readjustments shall not exceed
the decrease in Conversion Price made upon the issuance of the Common Stock Equivalents to
which such readjustments relate. If any Common Stock Equivalents by their terms provide for
subsequent decreases in the additional consideration payable for the related Common Stock or
for subsequent increases in the number of shares of Common Stock obtainable, then, upon any
such decrease or increase, the Conversion Price shall be appropriately adjusted to the extent such
Common Stock Equivalents have not then expired or been exercised or converted.

(v) In case the Corporation shall declare a dividend or make
any other distribution upon any stock of the Corporation payable in Common Stock or Common
Stock Equivalents, such Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents shall be deemed to have
been issued or sold without consideration as of the earlier of the related record or payment date.

(vi) | The number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any
point in time shall include all shares then issuable or to become issuable pursuant to any
Common Stock Equivalent then issued or to be issued.

(vii) The following issuances of Common Stock or Common
Stock Equivalents, which would otherwise trigger an adjustment of the Conversion Price under
this Section B.4(d), will not trigger such an adjustment: (1) any dividend or distribution on any
Preferred Stock; (2) any stock for which adjustment of the Conversion Price is made pursuant to
Section B.4(c) above or Sections B.4(f), B.4(g) or B.4(h) below; (3) securities offered by the
Corporation to the public in a Qualified Public Offering (as defined in Section B.5S(a) below);
(4) securities reissued to directors, employees, or consultants following the Corporation’s
acquisition of such securities pursuant to restricted stock arrangements with individuals who
have terminated their relationship with the Corporation or shares subject to options granted to
individuals who have terminated their relationship with the Corporation which are not exercised;
(5) shares of Common Stock, or securities convertible into or exercisable for such shares, issued
pursuant to an agreement solely to acquire or license technology (including without limitation
sponsored research) by the Corporation or to a collaborative partner of the Corporation in
connection with a corporate partnering transaction, if such agreement is approved by the Board
of Directors; (6) securities issued pursuant to any right or agreement to the extent to which an
adjustment was previously made to the Conversion Price established by this Section B.4 with
respect to the initial sale or grant by the Corporation of such right or agreement; (7) all securities
issued or issuable pursuant to warrants or options outstanding on the Filing Date (subject to
clause (11) below); (8) shares of Common Stock (“Option Shares”) issued or issuable upon
exercise of stock options (“Options”) granted to directors, officers, employees and consultants of
the Corporation, which are approved by the non-employee members of the Board of Directors,
under either the Corporation’s Amended and Restated 2002 Incentive and Non-Incentive Stock
Option Plan or the Corporation’s 201] Stock Incentive Plan (collectively, the “Plans”) approved
by the Board of Directors and adopted by the stockholders, whether previously existing or
granted after the Filing Date, each of which Options has a per share exercise price that is not less
than the per share fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of the Option grant, and
which number of Option Shares does not exceed the greater of (x) 16,312,941 (inclusive of
previously issued option grants) or (y) such higher number approved by the Board of Directors,

15
which approval must include the affirmative vote or consent of all the directors elected solely by
the holders of Preferred Stock; (9) securities issued in connection with any acquisition approved
by the holders of fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding Preferred Stock of the Corporation;
(10) up to 6,318,228 shares of Series F Preferred Stock and up to 3,580,908 shares of Series G
Preferred Stock issued pursuant to the Series F and Series G Preferred Stock Purchase
Agreement, dated August 29, 2014 (it being understood that the Series C Stock Split, Series D
Stock Split and Series E Stock Split and the corresponding reduction in the Series C Original
Purchase Price, Series D Original Purchase Price and Series F Original Purchase Price and the
respective Conversion Price for each such series from the prices that were in effect prior to the
filing of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation reflect the anti-dilution
adjustment with respect to the issuance of Series F Preferred Stock and Series G Preferred Stock,
which are being made in lieu of, and have the same economic effect as, a reduction in the
Conversion Price for each such series that would otherwise have served as the anti-dilution
adjustment); (1!) up to 4,927,468 shares of Series F Preferred Stock issuable upon conversion of
that certain Series F Preferred Stock Purchase Warrant, issued on August 29, 2014 (the
“Warrant”™) (it being understood that the Series C Stock Split, Series D Stock Split and Series E
Stock Split and the corresponding reduction in the Series C Original Purchase Price, Series D
Original Purchase Price and Series E Original Purchase Price and the respective Conversion
Price for each such series from the prices that were in effect prior to the filing of this Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation reflect the anti-dilution adjustment with respect to the
issuance of the Warrant, which are being made in lieu of, and have the same economic effect as,
a reduction in the Conversion Price for each such series that would otherwise have served as the
anti-dilution adjustment; provided, however, that it is further understood, notwithstanding clause
(7) above, that an additional anti-dilution adjustment shall be made in the event that the Warrant
becomes exercisable for additional shares of Series F Preferred Stock) and (12) Common Stock
issued upon conversion of the Preferred Stock.

{e) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If the Corporation
shall at any time, or from time to time after the Filing Date, effect a subdivision of the
outstanding Common Stock, the Conversion Price then in effect immediately before that
subdivision shall be proportionately decreased. If the Corporation shall at any time, or from time
to time after the Filing Date, effect a subdivision of the Preferred Stock, the Conversion Price
with respect to the Preferred Stock then in effect immediately before that subdivision shall be
proportionately increased. If the Corporation shall at any time, or from time to time after the
Filing Date, combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price then in
effect immediately before the combination shall be proportionately increased. If the Corporation
shall at any time, or from time to time after the Filing Date. combine the outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock, the Conversion Price with respect to the Preferred Stock then in effect
immediately before the combination shall be proportionately decreased. Any adjustment under
this paragraph shall become effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or
combination becomes effective.

(f) Adjustment for Certain Dividends and Distributions. In the event
the Corporation at any time, or from time to time after the Filing Date, shall make or issue, or f1x
a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or
other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock, then, and in each such event,
the Conversion Price for the Preferred Stock then in effect shall be decreased as of the time of

16
such issuance or, in the event such a record date, shall have been fixed, as of the close of
business on such record date, by multiplying the Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction:

(1) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares
of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance
or the close of business on such record date, and

(2) the denominator of which shall be the total number of
shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such
issuance or the close of business on such record date plus the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution;

provided, however, if such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend is not fully paid
or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the Conversion Price for the
Preferred Stock shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record date
and thereafter the Conversion Price for the Preferred Stock shall be adjusted pursuant to this
paragraph as of the time of actual! payment of such dividends or distributions; and provided
further, however, that no such adjustment shall be made if the holders of Preferred Stock
simultaneously receive a dividend or other distribution of shares of Common Stock in a number
equal to the number of shares of Common Stock as they would have received if all outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event.

(g) Adjustments for Other Dividends Distributions. In the event the
Corporation at any time, or from time to time after the Filing Date, shall make or issue or fix a
record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or
other distribution payable in securities of the Corporation other than shares of Common Stock,
then, and in each such event, provision shall be made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock
shall receive upon conversion thereof, in addition to the number of shares of Common Stock
receivable thereupon, the amount of securities of the Corporation that they would have received
had the Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event and had
they thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to, and including, the conversion
date, retained such securities receivable by them as aforesaid during such period, giving
application to all adjustments called for during such period under this paragraph with respect to
the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock; provided, however, that no such adjustment shall
be made if the holders of Preferred Stock simultancously receive a dividend or other distribution
of such securities in an amount equal to the amount of such securities as they would have
received if all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock on
the date of such event.

(h) Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange or Substitution. If the
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same

or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by capital
reorganization, reclassification, or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares
or stock dividend provided for above, or a reorganization, merger, consolidation, or sale of assets
provided for below), then, and in cach such event, the holder of each such share of Preferred
Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such share into the kind and amount of shares of
stock and other securities and property receivable upon such reorganization, reclassification, or
other change by holders of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of
Preferred Stock might have been converted immediately prior to such reorganization,
reclassification or change, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein.

(i) No Impairment. Without the requisite consents required under
Section B.7, the Corporation will not, by amendment of its Certificate of Incorporation or
through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of
securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of
any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Corporation, but will at all times
in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Section B.4 and in the taking
of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the rights of the holders
of the Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section B.4 against impairment.

(j) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each
adjustment or readjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section B.4, the Corporation,
al its expense, shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the
terms hereof and furnish to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such
adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or
readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon the written request at any time (but not more
than twice in any twelve (12) month period) of any holder of shares representing at least five
percent (5%) of the authorized number of shares of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be
furnished to such holder a similar certificate setting forth (1) such adjustments and readjustments,
(ii) the Conversion Price then in effect, and (111) the number of shares of Common Stock and the
amount, if any, of other property which then would be received upon the conversion of Preferred
Stock.

(k) Special Series G Conversion Right.

(i) If, subsequent to the Filing Date, the Corporation proposes
to issue additional equity securities (“New Equity Securities”), each holder of Series G Preferred
Stock may elect to exchange all or any portion of its shares of Series G Preferred Stock for
shares of the New Equity Securities. Upon such election, the holder of Series G Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to receive a number of shares of New Equity Securities equal to (A) the Series G
Original Purchase Price multiplied by the number of shares of Series G Preferred Stock being
exchanged, divided by (B) the per share price of the New Equity Securities being offered by the
Corporation.

(ii) If the Corporation intends to issue New Equity Securities,
then it shall give each holder of Serics G Preferred Stock prior written notice of such intention,
describing the type of New Equity Securities proposed to be issued, the price thereof, and the
general terms upon which the Corporation proposes to effect such issuance (the “Sale Notice”).
Each holder of Series G Preferred Stock shall have twenty (20) days from the date of delivery of
any Sale Notice to make its election to exchange such shares by giving written notice to the
Corporation stating the quantity of shares of Series G Preferred Stock to be exchanged.

(iii) If a holder of Series G Preferred Stock elects to exchange
shares of Series G Preferred Stock into shares of the New Equity Securities pursuant to
Section B.4(k)(i) above, such holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates for such shares
of Series G Preferred Stock at the principal office of the Corporation together with written notice
that such holder elects to exchange all or any number of the shares of the Series G Preferred
Stock represented by such certificate or certificates. If required by the Corporation, certificates
surrendered for exchange shall be endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or
instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered
holder or such holder’s attorney duly authorized in writing.

(iv) No fractional shares of New Equity Securities shall be
issued upon exchange of the Series G Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which
the holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay to such holder an amount equal
to such fraction multiplied by the price per share pursuant to which the New Equity Securities
are being offered.

(v) At the closing of the issuance of any New Equity
Securities, the Corporation shall issue and deliver at such office of such holder of Series G
Preferred Stock, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of New Equity Securities to
which such holder shal! be entitled, together with payment in lieu of any fraction of a share
pursuant to Section B.4(k)(iv) above. On the closing date for such offering of New Equity
Securities, all shares of Series G Preferred Stock which shall have been surrendered for exchange
as hercin provided shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights with respect to such
shares, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and to vote, shall immediately cease and
terminate, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive shares of New Equity Securities
in exchange therefor and payment of any dividends declared but unpaid thereon. Any shares of
Series G Preferred Stock so exchanged shall be retired and cancelled and shall not be reissued,
and the Corporation (without the need for stockholder action) may from thereafter take such
appropriate action as may be necessary to reduce the authorized Series G Preferred Stock and
Preferred Stock accordingly.

(vi) | The Corporation shall pay any and all tssue and other taxes
(other than taxes based on income) that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of
shares of New Equity Securities upon exchange of shares of Series G Preferred Stock pursuant to
this Section B.4(k). The Corporation shall not, however, be required to pay any tax which may
be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of shares of New
Equity Securities in a name other than that in which the shares of Series G Preferred Stock so
converted were registered, and no such issuance or delivery shall be made unless and until the
person or entity requesting such issuance has paid to the Corporation the amount of any such tax
or has established, to the satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax has been paid.

5. Mandatory Conversions.
(a) Qualified Public Offering: Affirmative Election.

(i) All outstanding shares of Preferred Stock — shall
automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the then effective Conversion Price
(provided, however, that all outstanding shares of Series G Preferred Stock shall be
automatically converted into shares of Common Stock at a price per share of $0.5285 (as
appropriately adjusted for stock splits and the like)) upon the earlier to occur of (i) the closing
(the “Mandatory Conversion Date”) of the sale by the Corporation of shares of Common Stock
in a firm commitment, underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration
statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), through a firm
acceptable to the Board of Directors of the Corporation resulting in at least $25,000,000 of gross
proceeds to the Corporation (before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
offering expenses) and a pre-moncy valuation of at least $300,000,000 (a “Qualified Public
Offering”), or (ii) upon the affirmative election of the holders of at least a majority of the
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class, in connection with the
closing of a firm commitment, underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration
statement under the Securities Act, covering the offer and sale of Common Stock for the account
of the Corporation which is not a Qualified Public Offering. For purposes of the preceding
sentence, pre-money valuation shall be calculated by multiplying (x) the per share offering price
of the Corporation’s shares in the public offering (before deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and offering expenses), by (y) the total number of shares of Common Stock of the
Corporation outstanding immediately before the closing of the public offering, assuming
conversion of then outstanding Preferred Stock, and including all other convertible securities and
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of all then outstanding options, rights, and warrants.

(ii) All holders of record of shares of Preferred Stock will be
given ten (10) business days prior written notice of the Mandatory Conversion Date and the
place designated for mandatory conversion of all such shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this
Section B.5(a). Such notice shall be sent both by facsimile transmission (if a facsimile number
has been provided and is operational) and by first-class or registered mail, postage prepaid, to
each record holder of Preferred Stock at such holder’s facsimile number and address last shown
on the records of the Corporation for the Preferred Stock. Upon receipt of such notice, each
holder of shares of Preferred Stock shall surrender his, her or its certificate or certificates for all
such shares to the Corporation at the place designated in such notice, and shall thereafter receive
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to this Section B.5({a). On the Mandatory Conversion Date, all rights with respect to the
Preferred Stock so converted, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and vote, will
terminate, except only the rights of the holders thereof, upon surrender of their certificate or
certificates therefor, to receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which
such Preferred Stock has been converted and to receive all declared but unpaid dividends. If so
required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or
accompanied by written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the
Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or by such holder’s attorney duly authorized
in writing. As soon as practicable after the Mandatory Conversion Date and the surrender of the
certificate or certificates for Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall cause to be issued and
delivered to such holder a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common
Stock issuable on such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof and cash as provided
in Section B.4(b) in respect of any fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon
such conversion. All declared and unpaid dividends on shares of Preferred Stock shall be paid in
cash upon mandatory conversion pursuant to this Section 5(a).

(iii) All certificates evidencing shares of Preferred Stock which
are required to be surrendered for conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof shall,

20
from and after the Mandatory Conversion Date, be deemed to have been retired and cancelled
and the shares of Preferred Stock represented thereby converted into Common Stock for all
purposes, notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender such
certificates on or prior to such date. The Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate action
(without the need for stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized Preferred
Stock accordingly.

(b) Mandatory Financings.

(i) Each share of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred
Stock, Series B-1 Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, Series E
Preferred Stock and Series F Preferred Stock held by a Non-Participating Holder (as defined
below) and outstanding as of the Filing Date (including any shares of Common Stock issued to
any Non-Participating Holder pursuant to any conversion of such Preferred Stock on or after
July 10, 2014, the “Affected Preferred Stock”) shall, effective immediately after the closing of
the issuance of Series F Preferred Stock pursuant to the Series F and Series G Preferred Stock
Purchase Agreement, dated August 29, 2014 (the “Series F Financing”), automatically be
converted into one-tenth (1/10th) of a share of Common Stock.

(ii) | For purposes of this Section B.5(b), (A) the “Pro Rata
Amount” of a holder of shares of Affected Preferred Stock means the product of 6,307,158
shares of Series F Preferred Stock times a fraction the numerator of which is the number of
shares of Affected Preferred Stock held by the holder and the denominator of which is the
number of shares of Affected Preferred Stock then outstanding; and (d) “Non-Participating
Holder” means a holder of shares of Affected Preferred Stock that does not invest at least such
holder’s Pro Rata Amount in the Series F Financing at the closing of such Series F Financing;
provided, however, that for purposes of determining whether a holder of Affected Preferred
Stock is a Non-Participating Holder, all shares of Affected Preferred Stock held by Affiliates (as
defined below) of such holder shall be aggregated with such holder’s shares and all shares of
Series F Preferred Stock issued in the Series F Financing purchased by Affiliates of such holder
shall be aggregated with the shares of Series F Preferred Stock purchased by such holder. For
purposes of this Section B.5(b), “Affiliate” shall mean, with respect to any holder of shares of
Affected Preferred Stock, any person, entity or firm which, directly or indirectly, controls, is
controlled by or is under common control with such holder, including, without limitation, any
entity of which the holder is a partner or member, any partner, officer, director, member or
employee of such holder and any venture capital fund now or hereafter existing of which the
holder is a partner or member which is controlled by or under common control with one or more
general partners of such holder or shares the same management company with such holder.

(iii) | No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon
conversion of Affected Preferred Stock under this provision. In lieu of any fractional shares to
which a Non-Participating Holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay to such
holder an amount based on the original purchase price of such Affected Preferred Stock as set
forth in Section B.1 above.

(iv) Immediately after the closing of the Series F Financing, all
rights with respect to Affected Preferred Stock converted into Common Stock pursuant to this

2]
Section B.5(b), including the rights, if any, to receive notices and vote, will terminate, except
only the rights of the holders thereof, upon surrender of their certificate or certificates therefor, to
receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which such Preferred Stock
has been converted. If so required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion
shall be endorsed or accompanied by written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form
satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or by such holder’s
attorney duly authorized in writing. Following any automatic conversion pursuant to this
Section B.5(b), the holders of certificates representing shares of Affected Preferred Stock
converted into Common Stock shall tender such certificates to the Corporation, and the
Corporation shall issue in exchange therefor certificates for the shares of Common Stock into
which such shares have been converted. All certificates evidencing shares of Affected Preferred
Stock which are required to be surrendered in accordance with the preceding sentence shall, from
and after the closing of the Series F Financing, be deemed to have been retired and cancelled and
the shares of Affected Preferred Stock represented thereby converted into Common Stock for all
purposes, notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender such
certificates. The Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate action (without the need for
stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized Preferred Stock and any series
thereof accordingly.

6. Redemption Event.

(a) The Corporation will, subject to the conditions set forth below,
including the possible extension of such date in accordance with this Section B.6(a), on
January 1, 2018 and on each of the first and second anniversaries thereof (each such date being
referred to hereinafter as a “Redemption Date”), upon receipt of written request(s) (an “Initial
Redemption Request”) for redemption not less than thirty (30) days prior to the applicable
Redemption Date from holders of at least a simple majority of the shares of Series A Preferred

of at least a simple majority of the shares of Series I’ Preferred Stock, making demand as a
separate class and/or from holders of at least a simple majority of the shares of Series G
Preferred Stock, making demand as a separate class (such demanding holders of Series A
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series B-1 Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the holders of any series of Preferred Stock be
entitled to have such shares redeemed by the Corporation pursuant to this Section B.6(a), unless
the approval of the holders of Preferred Stock under Section B.7(a) is obtained.

(b)} If the funds of the Corporation legally available for redemption of
Preferred Stock on any Redemption Date are insufficient to redeem all of the number of shares of
Preferred Stock required under Section B.6(a) to be redeemed on such date, those funds which
are legally available will be used to redeem the maximum possible number of such shares of
Preferred Stock ratably among the holders of such shares to be redeemed such that (x) of the
total funds legally available for redemption, the Corporation shall apply to redeem the Preferred
Stock held by the holders of each series an amount equal to the total amount available for
redemption multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount originally paid to the
Corporation by the holders of such series for the Preferred Stock of that series they are seeking to
have redeemed, and the denominator of which is the amount originally paid to the Corporation
for all shares of Preferred Stock for which redemption in sought, and (y) each holder of a share
of a particular series of Preferred Stock will receive the same percentage of the applicable
Redemption Price for each share of such series. At any time thereafter when additional funds of
the Corporation become legally available for the redemption of Preferred Stock, such funds will
be used, at the end of the next succeeding fiscal quarter, to redecm the balance of the shares
which the Corporation was theretofore obligated to redeem, ratably on the basis set forth in the
preceding sentence.

(c) The Corporation shall provide notice of its receipt of an Initial
Redemption Request, specifying the time, manner and place of redemption and the Redemption
Price (a “Redemption Notice”), by first-class or registered mail, postage prepaid, to each holder
of record of all series of Preferred Stock, at the address for such holders last shown on the
records of the transfer agent therefor (or the records of the Corporation, if it serves as its own
transfer agent), not less than twenty (20) days prior to the applicable Redemption Date. Each
holder of record of Preferred Stock may elect to become, together with each of the Initial
Requesting Holders, one of the “Requesting Holders” on such Redemption Date by so indicating
in a written notice mailed to the Corporation, by first-class or registered mail, postage prepaid, at

23
least ten (10) days prior to the applicable Redemption Date. The Corporation will not redeem
shares of Preferred Stock held by any Requesting Holder unless it redeems shares of Preferred
Stock held by all Requesting Holders, with the allocation of available funds made in accordance
with Section B.6(b) above if the funds are not sufficient to redeem al] shares. Each Requesting
Holder shall surrender to the Corporation on the applicable Redemption Date the certificate(s)
representing the shares to be redeemed on such date, in the manner and at the place designated in
the Redemption Notice. Thereupon, the Redemption Price shal! be paid to the order of each such
Requesting Holder and each certificate surrendered for redemption shall be canceled. In case
less than all Preferred Stock represented by any certificate is redeemed in any redemption
pursuant to this Section B.6, a new certificate will be issued representing the unredeemed
Preferred Stock without cost to the holder thereof.

(d) Unless there shall have been a default in payment of the applicable
Redemption Price, no share of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to any dividends declared after its
Redemption Date, and on such Redemption Date all rights of the holder of such share as a
stockholder of the Corporation by reason of the ownership of such share will cease, except the
right to receive the applicable Redemption Price of such share, without interest, upon
presentation and surrender of the certificate representing such share, and such share will not from
and after such Redemption Date be deemed to be outstanding.
