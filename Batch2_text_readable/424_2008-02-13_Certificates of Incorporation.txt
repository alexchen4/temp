(c} Mechanics of Conversion.

(i) Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled voluntarily
to convert the same into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the
certificate or certificates therefor (or evidence satisfactory to the Corporation as to the
loss of such certificate or certificates), duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or
of any transfer agent for such stock, and shall give written notice to the Corporation at
such office that such holder elects to convert the same (except that no such written
notice of election to convert shall be necessary in the event of an automatic conversion
pursuant to Section C.4(b) hereo!) and shall state therein the number of shares of
Preferred Stock to be converted and the name or names in which such holder wishes the
certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued. The Corporation
shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of
Preferred Stock a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock
to which such holder shall be entitled. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been
made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of surrender of the shares
of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all
purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date.

(ii) If the conversion is in connection with an underwritten olfering
of securilies pursuant to the Securities Act (including a Qualified iPO), the conversion
may, at the option of any holder tendering shares of Preferred Stock for conversion, be
conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to
such offering, in which event the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock upon
conversion of the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred
Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities, If the conversion
occurs through the vote of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of Preferred
Stock then outstanding as set forth in Section C.4(b)(i) hereof, such conversion shall be
deemed to have been made at the close of business on the day written notice of such
election has been received by the Corporation or such later date as set forth in such
written notice, and the person or persons entitled to reccive shares of Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or
holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date. Until certificates for such
shares of the Preferred Stock which have been converted have been delivered to the
Corporation for exchange for certificates representing such Common Stock, such
certificates shall be deemed to represent the sharcs of Common Stock into which such
Preferred Stock has been converted.

Common Stock previously issued upon conversion of the shares of such series
of Preferred Stock); ,

(C) upon the expiration of any such Options or any rights of

(1) — inthe case of Convertible Securities or Options
for Common Stock the only Additional Shares of Common Stock issued
were the shares of Common Stock, if any, actually issued upon the
exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities and the consideration received therefor was the

PA\I0S29838.13

(E) in the case of any Options which expire by their terms not
more than thirty (30) days after the date of issue thereof, no adjustment of the
Conversion Price for a series of Preferred Stock shall be made until the
expiration or exercise of al] such Options, whereupon such adjustment shall be
made in the same manner provided in clause (C) above.

(iv) Adjustment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional
Shares of Common Stock. In the event this Corporation, at any time after the Original

Issue Date, shall issue Additional Shares of Common Stock (including Additional
Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to Section C.4(d)(iii) hereof)
without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the applicable
Conversion Price with respect to a series of Preferred Stock in effect on the date of and
immediately prior to such issue, then and in such event, the applicable Conversion Price
for such series of Preferred Stock then in effect shall be reduced, concurrently with
such issuance, to a price determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a
fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares of Common
Stock that the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for the total number
of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued would purchase at such Conversion
Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance, and the denominator of which shall
be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such
issuance plus the number of such Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued. For
the purpose of the above calculation, the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such issuance shall be calculated as of the date of
conversion on a fully-diluted basis, as if all shares of Preferred Stock and all
Convertible Securities had been fully converted into shares of Common Stock
immediately prior to such issuance and any outstanding Options had been fully
exercised immediately prior to such issuance (and the resulting securities fully
converted into shares of Common Stock, if so convertible), but not including in such
calculation any additional shares of Common Stock issuable with respect to shares of
Preferred Stock, Convertible Securities or outstanding Options, solely as a result of the
adjustment of the respective Conversion Price (or other conversion ratios) resulting
from the issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock causing such adjustment.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this Section
C.4(d), the consideration received by the Corporation for the issuance of any Additional
Shares of Common Stock shall be computed as follows:

(A) Cash and Property. Such consideration shall:

(1) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
ageregate amount af cash received by the Corporation, excluding
amounts paid or payable for accrued interest or accrued dividends;

(2) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, .

be computed at the fair value thereof at the time of such issue, as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors; and

(3) — in the event Additional Shares of Common Stack
are issued logether with other shares or securities or other assets of the
Corporation for consideration that covers both, be the proportion of such
consideration so received, computed as provided in clauses (1) and (2)
above, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(B) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration
per share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock

deemed to have been issued pursuant to Section C,.4(d)(iv) hereof, relating to
