provided for in any Option referred’ to in Section 5(e)(1), the additional
consideration, if any, payable upon the conversion or exchange of any
Convertible Securities referred to in Section 5(e)(1) or (2), or the rate at which
Convertible Securities referred to in Section 5(e)(1) or (2) are convertible into
or exchangeable for Common Stock shall change at any time (including, but
not limited to, changes under or by reason of provisions designed to protect
against dilution), the Series A-1 Conversion Price, Series A-2 Conversion
Price, Series A-3 Conversion Price or Series A-4 Conversion Price in effect at
the time of such event shall forthwith be readjusted to the Series A-1
Conversion Price, Series A-2 Conversion Price, Series A-3 Conversion Price or
Series A-4 Conversion Price which would have been in effect at such time had
such Options or Convertible Securities still outstanding provided for such
changed purchase price, additional consideration or conversion rate, as the case

may be, at the time initially granted; issued or sold, but only if as a result of -- ~~

such adjustment the Series A-1 Conversion Price, Series A-2 Conversion Price,
Series A-3 Conversion Price or Series A-4 Conversion Price then in effect
hereunder is thereby reduced and on the termination of any such Option or any
such right to convert or exchange such Convertible Securities without exercise,
conversion or exchange thereof, the Series A-1 Conversion Price, Series A-2
Conversion Price, Series A-3 Conversion Price or Series A-4 Conversion Price
then in effect hereunder shall forthwith be increased to the Series A-]
Conversion Price, Series A-2 Conversion Price, Series A-3 Conversion Price or

{00338083.1} 11
Series A-4 Conversion Price which would have been in effect at the time of
such termination had such Option or Convertible Securities, to the extent
outstanding immediately prior to such termination, never been issued.

(4) Stock Dividends. In case the Corporation shall declare a
dividend or make any other distribution upon any stock of the Corporation
(other than the Common Stock) payable in Common Stock, Options or
Convertible Securities, then any Common Stock, Options or Convertible
Securities, as the case may be, issuable in payment of such dividend or
distribution shall be deemed to have been issued or sold without consideration.

(5) Calculation of Consideration Received. In case any shares of
Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities shall be issued or sold for
cash, the consideration received therefor shall be deemed to be the amount
received by the Corporation therefor, without deduction therefrom of any
expenses incurred or any underwriting commissions, discounts or concessions
paid or allowed by the Corporation in connection therewith. In case any shares
of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities shall be issued or sold for
a consideration other than cash, the amount of the consideration other than cash
received by the Corporation shall be deemed to be the fair value of such
consideration as determined in the reasonable good faith judgment of the Board
of Directors of the Corporation, without deduction of any expenses incurred or
any underwriting commissions, discounts or concessions paid or allowed by the
Corporation in connection therewith. In case any Options or Convertible
Securities shall be issued in connection with the issue and sale of other
securities of the Corporation, together comprising one integral transaction in
which no specific consideration is allocated to such Options or Convertible
Securities by the parties therein, such Options or Convertible Securities shall be
deemed to have been issued for a consideration of $.001.

(6) Record Date. In case the Corporation shall take a record of the
holders of its Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them: (i) to receive a
dividend or other distribution payable in Common Stock, Options or
Convertible Securities; or (ii) to subscribe for or purchase Common Stock,
Options or Convertible Securities, then such record date shall be deemed to be
the date of the issue or sale of the shares of Common Stock deemed to have
been issued or sold upon the declaration of such dividend or the making of such
other. distribution. or the date of the granting of such right of subscription or
purchase, as the case may be.

(7) Treasury Shares. The number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding at any given time shall not include shares owned or held by or for
the account of the Corporation, and the disposition of any such shares shall be
considered an issue or sale of Common Stock for the purpose of this Section
5(e).

{00338083.1}12
(f) Certain Issues of Common Stock Excepted for Conversion Price Adjustment.
Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the contrary, the Corporation shal! not be required
to make any adjustment of the Series A-1 Conversion Price, Series A-2 Conversion Price, Series
A-3 Conversion Price or Series A-4 Conversion Price (appropriately adjusted to reflect the
occurrence of any event described in Section 5(e)) in the case of the issuance or sale from and
after the Effective Date of shares of Common Stock: (i) pursuant to an equity compensation plan
approved by the Corporation’s Board of Directors; (ii) upon conversion of shares of Preferred
Stock; (iii) pursuant to a Qualified Public Offering; or (iv) as a stock dividend, stock split or
combination, reorganization or reclassification or other stock distribution with which an
adjustment to the Series A-1 Conversion Price, Series A-2 Conversion Price, Series A-3
Conversion Price or Series A-4 Conversion Price is made pursuant to Sections 5(e){4), 5(g) and
5(h). The reissuance of shares of Common Stock, the issuance of which was originally excepted
pursuant to subsection (i) above, which are repurchased by the Corporation from such persons
after such date pursuant to contractual rights held by the Corporation and at repurchase prices not
exceeding the respective original purchase prices paid by such persons to the Corporation
therefor, plus interest, shall likewise be excepted if the terms of the approved equity
compensation plan permits such reissuance.

(g) Subdivision or Combination of Common Stock.

(1) Series A Preferred Stock. If the Corporation shall at any time subdivide
(by any stock split, stock dividend or otherwise) its outstanding shares of Common Stock
into a greater number of shares, the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to such
subdivision shall be proportionately adjusted so that each share of Series A Preferred
Stock converts into the corresponding increased number of shares of Common Stock, and
conversely, in case the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be
combined into a smaller-number of shares, the Conversion Rate in effect immediately
prior to such combination shall be proportionately adjusted so that each share of Series A
Preferred Stock converts into the corresponding decreased number of shares of Common
Stock. (Example, if the outstanding shares of Common Stock are subdivided into twice
as many shares, then the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted so that each share of Series A
Preferred Stock is convertible into two shares of Common Stock, and conversely, if the
outstanding shares of Common Stock are combined into half as many shares, then the
Conversion Rate shall be adjusted so that each share of Series A Preferred Stock is
convertible into one-half share of Common Stock).

(2) ies A-1, A-2, A-3 and A-4 Preferred Stock. If the Corporation shall at
any time subdivide (by any stock split, stock dividend or.otherwise) its outstanding shares .
of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, the Series A-1 Conversion Price,
Series A-2 Conversion Price, Series A-3 Conversion Price or Series A-4 Conversion
Price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall be proportionately reduced,
and conversely, in case the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be
combined into a smaller number of shares, the Series A-1 Conversion Price, Series A-2
Conversion Price, Series A-3 Conversion Price or Series A-4 Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such combination shall be proportionately increased. In the case of

(00338083.1}13
any such subdivision, no further adjustment shall be made pursuant to Section 5(e)(4) by
reason thereof.

(h) Reorganization or Reclassification.

(1) Series A Preferred Stock. In case of any reclassification of the Common
Stock, any consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into another Person
(defined as a corporation, an association, a partnership, organization, a business, an
individual, a government or political subdivision thereof or a governmental agency), the
sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation or any
compulsory share exchange pursuant to which Common Stock is converted into other
securities, cash or property (unless such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer or share
exchange is a “Deemed Liquidation”), the holders of Series A Preferred Stock then
outstanding shall have the right thereafter to convert such shares only into the shares of
stock and other securities and property receivable upon or deemed to be held by holders
of Common Stock following such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or
share exchange, and the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled upon such
conversion to receive such amount of securities or property as the shares of Common
Stock into which such shares of Series A Preferred Stock could have been converted
immediately prior to such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share
exchange would have been entitled. The terms of any such consolidation, merger, sale,
transfer or share exchange shall include such terms so as to continue to give to the holder
of Series A Preferred Stock the right to receive the securities or property set forth in this
Section S5(c)(1) upon any conversion following such consolidation, merger, sale, transfer
or share exchange. This provision shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications,
consolidations, mergers, sales, transfers or share exchanges.

G) If:

a. the Corporation shal! declare a dividend (or any other
distribution) on its Common Stock; or

b. the Corporation shall declare a special nonrecurring cash
dividend on or a redemption of its Common Stock; or

c. the Corporation shall authorize the granting to all holders
of the Common Stock rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any shares
of capital stock of any class or of any rights; or

d. the approval of any stockholders of the Corporation shall
be required in connection with any reclassification of the Common Stock of the
Corporation (other than a subdivision or combination of the outstanding shares
of Common Stock), any consolidation or merger to which the Corporation is a
party, any sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Corporation, or any compulsory share exchange whereby the Common Stock is
converted into other securities, cash or property; or

{00338083.1) 14
e. the Corporation shall authorize the voluntary or
involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the affairs of the
Corporation; then the Corporation shall cause to be filed at each office or agency
maintained for the purpose of conversion of Series A Preferred Stock, and shall
cause to be mailed to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock at their last
addresses as they shall appear upon the stock books of the Corporation, at least
15 calendar days prior to the applicable record or effective date hereinafter
specified, a notice stating: (A) the date on which a record is to be taken for the
purpose of such dividend, distribution, redemption, rights or warrants, or if a
record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of Common Stock of
record to be entitled to such dividend, distributions, redemption, rights or
warrants are to be determined; or (B) the date on which such reclassification,
consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, share exchange, dissolution, liquidation or
winding-up is expected to become effective, and the date as of which it is
expected that holders of Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange
their shares of Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon
such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, share exchange,
dissolution, liquidation or winding-up; provided, however, that the failure to
mail such notice or any defect therein or in the mailing thereof shall not affect
the validity of the corporate action required to be specified in such notice and
provided further that such notice may be waived in writing by holders of at least
51% of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock. The failure of a holder of any
Series A Preferred Stock to exercise the right of conversion prior to the record
date for any action set forth above shall cause such holder to forfeit any nights
accruing to the Common Stock.

(2) Series A-1, A-2, A-3 and A-4 Preferred Stock. If any capital
reorganization or reclassification of the capital stock of the Corporation shall be effected
in such a way that holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive stock, securities
or assets with respect to or in exchange for Common Stock, then, as a condition of such
reorganization or reclassification, lawful and adequate provisions shall be made whereby
each holder of a share or shares of Preferred Stock shall thereupon have the right to
receive, upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified herein and in lieu of
the shares of Common Stock immediately theretofore receivable upon the conversion of
such share or shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series A-2 Preferred Stock, Series A-
3 Preferred Stock or Series A-4 Preferred Stock such shares of stock, securities or assets
as may be issued or payable with respect to or in exchange for a number of outstanding
- shares-of such Common Stock equal to the number of shares of such Common Stock
immediately theretofore receivable upon such conversion had such reorganization or
reclassification not taken place, and in any such case appropriate provisions shall be
made with respect to the rights and interests of such holder to the end that the provisions
hereof (including, without limitation, provisions for adjustment of the Conversion Price)
shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as may be, in relation to any shares of stock,
securities or assets thereafter deliverable upon the exercise of such conversion rights.

(i) Mandatory Conversion.

{00338083.1} 15
(1) Series A Preferred Stock. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall
automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock immediately upon the
closing of an underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration
statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, covering the offer and
sale of Common Stock for the account of the Corporation. Series A Preferred
Stock shall convert automatically and without any further action by the holders of
such shares and whether or not the certificates representing such shares are
surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent for the Common Stock.

(i) Upon the occurrence of the conversion specified in Section
(5){i)(1), the holders of such Series A Preferred Stock shall surrender the
certificates representing such shares at the office of the Corporation or of its
transfer agent for the Common Stock. Thereupon, there shall be issued and
delivered to such holder a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of
Common Stock into which the shares of Series A Preferred Stock surrendered
were convertible on the date on which such conversion occurred.

(2) Series A-1, A-2, A-3 and A-4 Preferred Stock. If at any time the
Corporation shall effect a firm commitment underwritten public offering of shares of
Common Stock in which: (i) the aggregate gross proceeds to the Corporation shall be at
least $15,000,000; (i1) the price paid by the public for such shares shall be at least $2.10
(prior to underwriter discounts and commissions, if any) (as adjusted for stock splits,
dividends or combinations or similar events); and (iii) immediately following the closing
of the sale of such shares by the. Corporation pursuant to such public offering (the “Public
Offering Closing”) shares of Common Stock will be listed on either the: (A) New York

Public Offering”), then effective upon the Public Offering Closing all outstanding shares
of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series A-2 Preferred Stock, Series A-3 Preferred Stock
and Series A-4 Preferred Stock shall automatically convert into shares of Common Stock
at the applicable Conversion Price then in effect in accordance with this Section 4.

Corporation at its principal office (or such other office or agency of the Corporation as
the Corporation may designate by notice in wmiting to such holders) during its usual
business hours, the certificate or certificates for the shares so converted. As promptly as
practicable thereafter, the Corporation shall issue and deliver to such holder a certificate
or certificates for the number of whole shares of Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled, together with any cash dividends and payment in lieu of fractional shares to
which such holder may be entitled pursuant to Section 5(j). Until such time as a holder of
shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series A-2 Preferred Stock, Series A-3 Preferred
Stock or Series A-4 Preferred Stock shall surrender his or its certificates therefor as
provided above, such certificates shall be deemed to represent the shares of Common
Stock to which such holder shall be entitled upon the surrender thereof.

(j) Fractional Shares.

(00338083.1}16
(1) Series A Preferred Stock. Upon a conversion hereunder by a holder of
Series A Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall not be required to issue stock certificates
representing fractions of shares of Common Stock, but may if otherwise permitted, make
a cash payment in respect of any final fraction of a share based on then market value at
such time. If the Corporation elects not, or is unable, to make such a cash payment, the
holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, in lieu of the final fraction
of a share, one whole share of Common Stock.

of any share or shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series A-2 Preferred Stock, Series
A-3 Preferred Stock or Series A-4 Preferred Stock, no fractional shares shall be issued
upon conversion of each respective Series of stock into Common Stock. If any fractional
share of Common Stock would, except for the provisions of the first sentence of this
Section 4(c)(2), be delivered upon such conversion, the Corporation, in lieu of delivering
such fractional share, shall pay to the holder surrendering the Series A-1 Preferred Stock,
Series A-2 Preferred Stock, Series A-3 Preferred Stock or Series A-4 Preferred Stock for
conversion an amount in cash equal to the current fair value of such fractional share as
determined in the reasonable good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the
Corporation.

A-1 Preferred Stock, Series A-2 Preferred Stock, Series A-3 Preferred Stock or Series A-
4 Preferred Stock on account of any cash dividends on the Common Stock issued upon

Preferred Stock, Series A-3 Preferred Stock or Series A-4 Preferred Stock represented by
the certificate or certificates surrendered pursuant to Section 5(c)(2) exceeds the number
of shares converted, the Corporation shall, upon such conversion, execute and deliver to
the holder, at the expense of the Corporation, a new certificate or certificates for the
Preferred Stock or Series A-4 Preferred Stock represented by the certificate or certificates
surrendered which are not to be converted.

available out of its authorized Common Stock, solely for the purpose of issuance upon the

with respect to the issue thereof, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Corporation covenants that it will from time to time take all such action as may be
requisite to assure that the par value per share of the Common Stock is at all times equal
to or less than the Conversion Price in effect at the time for each respective Series of
stock. The Corporation will take all such action as may be necessary to assure that all
such shares of Common Stock may be so issued without violation of any applicable law
or regulation, or of any requirement of any national securities exchange upon which the
Common Stock may be listed. The Corporation will not take any action which results in
any adjustment of the Conversion Price if the total number of shares of Common Stock
issued and issuable after such action upon conversion of each respective Series of stock
would exceed the total number of shares of Common Stock then authorized by this
Restated Certificate; provided that, without limitation as to other remedies which the
holders of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series A-2 Preferred Stock, Series A-3 Preferred
Stock or Series A-4 Preferred Stock may have with respect to the Corporation’s failure to
make Conversion Price adjustments or provide for sufficient reserved shares of Common
Stock to effect conversion at such reduced conversion prices in accordance with the terms
hereof (which other remedies shall not be limited by the first clause of this sentence), the

of all of Series A-1 Preferred Stock at such adjusted Series A-1 Conversion Price, all of
Series A-2 Preferred Stock at such adjusted Series A-2 Conversion Price, all of Series A-
3 Preferred Stock at such adjusted Series A-3 Conversion Price and all of Series A-4

which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of any
certificate in a name other than that of the holder of Preferred Stock which is being converted.

Series A-3 Preferred Stock or Series A-4 Preferred Stock except as may otherwise be required to
