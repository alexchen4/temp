1. Dividend Provisions.

(a) The holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B-2 Preferred
Stock and Series C Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive dividends (the “Fixed
Dividends”), out of any assets legally available therefor, payable at a per annum rate equal to
eight percent (8%) (the “Dividend Rate”) of the Series A Original Issue Price (as hereafter
defined), the Series B-2 Original Issue Price (as hereafter defined) and the Series C Original
Issue Price (as hereafter defined), respectively, calculated from the date of issuance of each such
share (the “Accrual Date”). For purposes of this Certificate of Incorporation, the “Series A
Onginal Issue Price” and the “Series B-2 Original Issue Price” will each be $0.83 per share, and
the “Series C Original Issue Price” will be $0.3791 per share, each as adjusted for any stock
splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations or the like occurring after the filing date hereof (the
“Filing Date”). The accrued Fixed Dividends on shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall be
payable in cash when and if declared by the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the “Beard”).
The accrued Fixed Dividends on shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock shall be payable in cash
when and if declared by the Board if and only if all accrued Fixed Dividends have been paid to
the holders of Series C Preferred Stock. The accrued Fixed Dividends on shares of Series A
Preferred Stock shall be payable in cash when and if declared by the Board or Directors if and

2
655645 v13/SD
only if all accrued Fixed Dividends have been paid to the holders of Series C Preferred Stock and
Series B-2 Preferred Stock. Accrued Fixed Dividends on any shares of Series A Preferred Stock
and Series B-2 Preferred Stock shall be cancelled upon conversion of such shares. Any
dividends payable by the Corporation in excess of the Fixed Dividends (“Additional Dividends”)
shall (i) first be paid to the holders of Series C Preferred Stock until such holders have received
aggregate Additional Dividends per share of Series C Preferred Stock that are equal to the Series
C Original Issue Price, (ii) then be paid to the holders of Series B-2 Preferred Stock until such
holders have received aggregate Additional Dividends per share of Series B-2 Preferred Stock
that are equal to the Series B-2 Original Issue Price, (iii) then to the holders of Series A Preferred
Stock until such holders have received aggregate Additional Dividends per share of Series A
Preferred Stock that are equal to the Series A Original Issue Price, and (iv) thereafter to the
holders of Common Stock, Series A Preferred Stock, Series B-2 Preferred Stock and Series C
Preferred Stock allocated among such holders on a pro rata basis, based upon the number of
shares of Common Stock held by each assuming the full conversion of all shares of Preferred
Stock. The Fixed Dividends will be cumulative from the applicable Accrual Date, and will
accrue on a day to day basis from the applicable Accrual Date based, whether or not earned or
declared.

(b) The Board will fix a record date for the determination of the holders of
Series A Preferred Stock and Series B-2 Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock entitled to
receive payment of a dividend declared thereon, which record date will not be more than forty-
five (45) days prior to the date fixed for payment of such dividends. Accrued Fixed Dividends
on the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B-2 Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock that are
not declared and paid will compound quarterly on each Dividend Compounding Date for each
such Series at the Dividend Rate. For purposes of this Certificate of Incorporation, the
“Dividend Compounding Date” for each share of Preferred Stock means the first day of each
January, April, July and October following the date of issuance of such share.

(c) Unless all accrued Fixed Dividends (whether or not declared) on each
share of Preferred Stock are paid, and the holders of each such share of Preferred Stock have
received aggregate Additional Dividends per share of Preferred Stock which are equal to the
Original Issue Price for each such share: (i) no dividends or other distributions (other than a
dividend or distribution payable solely in Common Stock) may be declared, made or paid on any
shares of Common Stock; (ii) no shares of Common Stock may be repurchased, exchanged,
redeemed or otherwise acquired for any consideration by the Corporation, any subsidiary of the
Corporation or any entity which the Corporation owns or controls (whether directly or
indirectly), provided, however, that this restriction shall not apply to the Permitted Repurchases
(as defined below); and (iii) no funds may be set apart or reserved with respect to any of the
actions described in clauses (i) or (ii).

(d) In the event the Corporation shall declare a distribution payable in
securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by the Corporation or other persons,
assets (excluding cash dividends pursuant to this Subsection B.1 of Article IV or dividends or
other distributions payable solely in Common Stock), then, in each such case the property so
distributed shall be valued for purposes of this Subsection B.1 of Article IV at its then fair
market value per share as determined by both the Corporation and the vote or written consent of
the holders of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock and

3
655645 v13/SD
Special Voting Stock (including the consent of (i) each holder of at least 3,500,000 shares of
Series C Preferred Stock (and in the case of a holder that is a venture capital fund, treating such
holder as holding all shares of Series C Preferred Stock held by it and any related venture capital
fund under common control) as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations or
the like occurring after the Filing Date and (ii) the holder of Special Voting Stock), voting as a
single class on an as-converted to Common Stock basis (the “Preferred Majority”), or, if the
Corporation and the Preferred Majority cannot agree on the fair market value per share, the fair
market value per share as determined by a qualified independent appraiser selected by the
Corporation and by the vote or written consent of the Preferred Majority; or if the Corporation
and the Preferred Majority cannot agree on an appraiser, the average of the fair market value per
share as determined by a qualified independent appraiser selected by the Corporation and the fair
market value per share as determined by a qualified independent appraiser selected by the vote or
written consent of the Preferred Majority.

(e) In the event the amount of Fixed Dividends to be paid on the Series A
Preferred Stock, the Series B-2 Preferred Stock or the Series C Preferred Stock at any time is not
sufficient to pay the accrued but unpaid Fixed Dividends in full on such Series, any partial
payment of such Fixed Dividends will be made to the holders of such Series ratably (on an as-if
converted basis) in proportion to the aggregate accrued but unpaid portion of the Fixed
Dividends on the shares of the applicable series of Preferred Stock held by such holders.

2. Liquidation Preference.

(a) In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of Series C Preferred Stock will be
entitled to receive in preference to the holders of all other equity securities of the Corporation an
amount per share equal to the greater of (A) the Series C Original Issue Price plus all accrued but
unpaid Fixed Dividends and all other declared but unpaid dividends thereon, and (B) the
aggregate amount that would be distributable with respect to the aggregate number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such share of Series C Preferred Stock (assuming
for purposes of such calculation, the conversion of all other shares of Preferred Stock). If upon
the occurrence of such event, the assets and funds thus distributed among the holders of Series C
Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full aforesaid
preferential amounts, then the entire assets and funds of the Corporation legally available for
distribution shall be distributed ratably among the holders of Series C Preferred Stock, in
proportion to the preferential amount each such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive.
Thereafter, the holders of Series B-2 Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive in preference to
the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and Common Stock an amount per share equal to the
greater of (A) the Series B-2 Original Issue Price plus all accrued but unpaid Fixed Dividends
and all other declared but unpaid dividends thereon, and (B) the aggregate amount that would be
distributable with respect to the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of such share of Series B-2 Preferred Stock (assuming for purposes of such
calculation, the conversion of all other shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock and Series A
Preferred Stock). If upon the occurrence of such event, the assets and funds thus distributed
among the holders of Series B-2 Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit the payment to
such holders of the full aforesaid preferential amounts, then the entire assets and funds of the
Corporation legally available for distribution shall be distributed ratably among the holders of

4
655645 v1¥SD
Series B-2 Preferred Stock in proportion to the preferential amount each such holder would
otherwise be entitled to receive. Thereafter, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock will be
entitled to receive in preference to the holders of Common Stock an amount per share equal to
the greater of (A) the Series A Original Issue Price plus all accrued but unpaid Fixed Dividends
and all other declared but unpaid dividends thereon, and (B) the aggregate amount that would be
distributable with respect to the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of such share of Series A Preferred Stock (assuming for purposes of such calculation,
the conversion of all other shares of Series A Preferred Stock). [f upon the occurrence of such
event, the assets and funds thus distributed among the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall
be insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full aforesaid preferential amounts,
then the entire assets and funds of the Corporation legally available for distribution shall be
distributed ratably among the holders of Series A Preferred Stock in proportion to the
preferential amount each such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive.

(b) | Upon the completion of the distribution required by subparagraph (a) of
this Subsection B.2, the remaining assets and funds of the Corporation legally available for
distribution to stockholders of the Corporation shall be distributed'ratably to the holders of shares
of Common Stock and Series C Preferred Stock on an as-converted to Common Stock basis.

(c) (i) For purposes of this Article [V and Subsection D.2 of Article IV, a
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation shall mean any of the following
transactions, unless the Preferred Majority elects otherwise by written notice sent to the
Corporation at least 10 days prior to the effective date of any such event:

' (A) the acquisition of the Corporation by another entity by
means of any transaction or series of related transactions (including, without limitation, any
reorganization, merger or consolidation) that results in the transfer of fifty percent (50%) or more
of the outstanding voting power of the Corporation; or

(B) the sale, lease, transfer, exclusive license or other
disposition, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, by the Corporation of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Corporation.

(ii) ‘If the consideration received by the Corporation upon a liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation is other than cash, its value will be deemed its fair
market value. Any securities shall be valued as follows:

(A) Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar
restrictions on free marketability covered by (B) below:

(1) If traded on a securities exchange, the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange over the thirty
(30) day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing of such event;

(2) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall

be deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the
thirty (30) day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing of such event; and

655645 vi3/SD

(3) If there is no active public market, the value shall be
the fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Corporation and the vote or written
consent of the Preferred Majority; or, if the Corporation and the Preferred Majority cannot agree
on the fair market value, the fair market value as determined by a qualified independent appraiser
selected by the Corporation and the vote or written consent of the Preferred Majority; or if the
Corporation and the Preferred Majority cannot agree on an appraiser, the average of the fair
market value as determined by a qualified independent appraiser selected by the Corporation and

written consent of the Preferred Majority.

(B) The method of valuation of securities subject to investment
letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of
a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount
from the fair market value determined as above in (A) (1), (2) or (3) to reflect the approximate
fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Corporation and the vote or written
consent of the Preferred Majority; or, if the Corporation and the Preferred Majority cannot agree

of the Corporation for such holder, notifying such holder of the redemption to be effected on the
applicable Redemption Date, specifying the number of shares to be redeemed from such holder,
the Redemption Date, the applicable Redemption Price, the place at which payment may be

Preferred Stock, as applicable (except the right to receive the applicable Redemption Price
without interest upon surrender of their certificate or certificates), shall cease with respect to such

deemed to be outstanding for any purpose whatsoever. If the funds of the Corporation legally
available for the redemption of the Redemption Shares on a Redemption Date are insufficient to

available will be used to redeem the maximum possible number of such shares first, at any Series
C Redemption Date, among the holders of such shares of Series C Preferred Stock to be redeemed
(ratably, if necessary), second, at any Series A/B-2 Redemption Date, among the holders of such
shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock to be redeemed (ratably, if necessary) and then third, at any
Series A/B-2 Redemption Date, among the holders of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock to

each other holder receives for any such share, such that each holder of a share of Series B-2
Preferred Stock to be redeemed receives for such share the same percentage of the applicable
Redemption Price as each other holder receives for any such share and such that each holder of a
share of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed receives for such share the same percentage of
the applicable Redemption Price as each other holder receives for any such share. The
Redemption Shares not redeemed shall remain outstanding and entitled to all the rights and
preferences provided herein and the Fixed Dividends as provided for in Subsection B.1 shall
continue to accrue with respect to such shares. At any time thereafter when additional funds of
the Corporation are legally available for the redemption of Redemption Shares, such funds will
immediately be used to redeem, first, the balance of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock that the
Corporation has become obliged to redeem on the Series C Redemption Date but that it has not
redeemed, second, the balance of the shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock that the Corporation
has become obliged to redeem on the Series A/B-2 Redemption Date but that it has not redeemed

Procedure”).

(b) Conversion Price.

(A) Senes A Conversion Price. The conversion price for the
Series A Preferred Stock shall initially be the Series A Original Issue Price (the “Series A

to affect the rights of the holders of Preferred Stock to the amounts they are entitled to with
respect to a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation (including amounts
calculated with reference to accrued and unpaid dividends).

(d) Mechanics of Conversion.

(A) Notice of Conversion. In order for a holder of Preferred
Stock to voluntarily convert shares of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, such holder
shall surrender the certificate or certificates for such shares of Preferred Stock (or, if such
registered holder alleges that such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate
affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation
against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft
or destruction of such certificate), at the office of the transfer agent for Preferred Stock (or at the
principal office of the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent), together
with written notice that such holder elects to convert all or any number of the shares of Preferred
Stock represented by such certificate or certificates and, if applicable, any event on which such
conversion is contingent. Such notice shall state such holder’s name or the names of the
nominees in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock
to be issued. If required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be
endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory
to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or his, her or its attorney duly
authorized in writing. The close of business on the date of receipt by the transfer agent (or by the
Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent) of such certificates (or lost
certificate affidavit and agreement) and notice shall be the time of conversion (the “Conversion
Time”), and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the shares represented by
such certificate and, as applicable, the Series Optional Conversion C Accrued Dividends, shall be
deemed to be outstanding of record as of such date. The Corporation shall, as soon as
practicable after the Conversion Time, (i) issue and deliver to such holder of Preferred Stock, or

10
655645 v13/SD
to his, her or its nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common
Stock issuable upon such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof and a certificate
for the number (if any) of the shares of Preferred Stock represented by the surrendered certificate
that were not converted into Common Stock, (ii) pay in cash such amount as provided in
Subsection B.4(j)(i) in lieu of any fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon
such conversion, (iii) pay all declared but unpaid dividends on the shares of Preferred Stock
converted and (iv) as applicable, pay in cash the Series C Optional Conversion Accrued
Dividends.

(B) Effect of Conversion. All shares of Preferred Stock which
shall have been surrendered for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be
outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares shall immediately cease and terminate at
the Conversion Time, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive shares of Common
Stock in exchange therefor (including, as applicable, with respect to the Series C Optional
Conversion Accrued Dividends), to receive payment in lieu of any fraction of a share otherwise
issuable upon such conversion as provided in Subsection B.4{j)(i), to receive payment of any
dividends declared but unpaid thereon and, as applicable, to receive payment of any Series C
Optional Conversion Accrued Dividends. Any shares of Preferred Stock so converted shall be
retired and cancelled and may not be reissued as shares of such series, and the Corporation may
thereafter take such appropriate action (without the need for stockholder action) as may be
necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Preferred Stock accordingly.

(C) No Further Adjustment. Upon any such conversion, no
adjustment to the Conversion Price of the applicable series of Preferred Stock shall be made for
any declared but unpaid dividends on the Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion or on the
Common Stock delivered upon conversion.

(D) Taxes. The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and
other similar taxes that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of
Common Stock upon conversion of shares of Preferred Stock and, as applicable, the Series C
Optional Conversion Accrued Dividends), pursuant to this Subsection B.4(d). The Corporation
shall not, however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer
involved in the issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in
which the shares of Preferred Stock so converted were registered, and no such issuance or
delivery shall be made unless and until] the person or entity requesting such issuance has paid to
the Corporation the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the
Corporation, that such tax has been paid.

(e) Automatic Conversion.

(A) | The conversion of all shares of Preferred Stock, at the then
applicable conversion rate specified in Subsection B.4(a)(i), shall automatically occur (i)
immediately prior to the Corporation’s sale of its Common Stock in a firm-commitment
underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement on Form S-1 or a
comparable successor form then in effect under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the
public offering price of which is not less than four (4) times the Series C Original Issue Price per
share (adjusted to reflect subsequent stock dividends, stock splits or recapitalizations occurring

11
655645 v13/SD
after the Filing Date) and proceeds to the Corporation which are not less than $40,000,000 in the
aggregate (net of underwriters’ discounts and expenses) (a “Qualifying IPQ”) or (ti) on the date
and time, or the occurrence of an event, specified by a vote or written consent of the Preferred
Majority (a “Preferred Majority Automatic Conversion”) upon which the corporation obtains the
consent or affirmative vote to such automatic conversion from the Preferred Majority (the time
of such conversion pursuant to either clause (i) or (ii) is referred to herein as the “Automatic
Conversion Time”).

(B) All of the unpaid Fixed Dividends on each share of Series
C Preferred Stock converted into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Subsection B.4(e)(A) that
are accrued and unpaid as of the Automatic Conversion Time (the “Series C Automatic
Conversion Accrued Dividends”, and together with the Series C Optional Conversion Accrued
Dividends, the “Series C Conversion Accrued Dividends”) shall, in the event of a Qualifying
IPO, automatically be paid in cash by the Corporation at the Automatic Conversion Time. In the
event of a Preferred Majority Automatic Conversion, the Series C Automatic Conversion
Accrued Dividends shall either be (A) paid in cash at or before the Automatic Conversion Time
or (B) converted into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is
determined by dividing the Series C Automatic Conversion Accrued Dividends by the higher of
(x) the fair market value per share of the Common Stock as of the Automatic Conversion Time .
or (y) the Series C Conversion Price as of the Automatic Conversion Time; provided, however
that the Corporation shall, in its sole and absolute discretion, elect whether the Series C
Automatic Conversion Accrued Dividends are paid in cash or converted into Common Stock in
connection with a Preferred Majority Automatic Conversion pursuant to this Subsection
B.4(e)(B). In the event the Corporation elects to convert the Series C Automatic Conversion
Accrued Dividends into Common Stock pursuant to this Subsection B.4(e)(B) then the fair
market value per share of the Common Stock shall be determined by the Common Stock
Valuation Procedure.

(C) All holders of record of shares of Preferred Stock shall be
sent written notice of the Automatic Conversion Time and the place designated for mandatory
conversion of all such shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Subsection B.4(e)(C). Such
notice need not be sent in advance of the occurrence of the Automatic Conversion Time. Upon
receipt of such notice, each holder of shares of Preferred Stock shall surrender his, her or its
certificate or certificates for all such shares (or, if such holder alleges that such certificate has
been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to
the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made against the
Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate) to the
Corporation at the place designated in such notice. If so required by the Corporation, certificates
surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by written instrument or
instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered
holder or by his, her or its attorney duly authorized in writing. All rights with respect to the
Preferred Stock and, as applicable, Series C Automatic Conversion Accrued Dividends,
converted pursuant to Subsections B.4(d)(A) and (B), respectively, including the rights, if any, to
receive notices and vote (other than as a holder of Common Stock), will terminate at the
Automatic Conversion Time (notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to
surrender the certificates at or prior to such time), except only the rights of the holders thereof,
upon surrender of their certificate or certificates (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement)

12
655645 v13/SD
therefor, to receive the items provided for in the next sentence of this Subsection B.4(e)(C). As
soon as practicable after the Automatic Conversion Time and the surrender of the certificate or
certificates (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement) for Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall
issue and deliver to such holder, or to his, her or its nominees, a certificate or certificates for the
number of full shares of Common Stock issuable on such conversion in accordance with the
provisions hereof including, as applicable, shares issuable in payment of any Series C Automatic
Conversion Accrued Dividends together with cash as provided in Subsection B.4(j)(i) in lieu of
any fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion and the
payment of any declared but unpaid dividends on the shares of Preferred Stock converted and, as
applicable, cash for payment of any Series C Automatic Conversion Accrued Dividends. Such
converted shares of Preferred Stock shal] be retired and cancelled and may not be reissued as
shares of such series, and the Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate action (without
the need for stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares
of Preferred Stock accordingly.

(f) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at
all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock,

solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of Preferred Stock, such number
of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (and dividends accrued on the Series C Preferred Stock)
and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be
sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (and
dividends accrued on the Series C Preferred Stock), in addition to such other remedies as shall be
available to the holders of Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate action as
may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such
number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging
in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to this
Certificate of Incorporation.

(g} Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock for Splits and
Combinations. The applicable Conversion Price of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B-2

Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as
follows:

(i) (A) _ If the Corporation shall issue, at any time after the Filing
Date, any Additional Stock (as defined below) without consideration or for a consideration per
share less than the Conversion Price for the Series C Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior
to such issuance, the Conversion Price of each of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B-2
Preferred Stock and the Series C Preferred Stock shall forthwith (except as otherwise provided in
this clause (i)) be adjusted to a price determined by multiplying the applicable Conversion Price
for such series by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance (including shares of Common Stock
deemed to be issued pursuant to Subsection B.4(g)(i)(F)(1) or (2)) plus the number of shares of
Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for such issuance
would purchase at the then applicable Conversion Price for such series; and the denominator of
which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such

13
655645 v13/SD
issuance (including shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to Subsection
B.4(g)(i)(F)(1) or (2)) plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock.

(B) No Adjustment of Conversion Price. No adjustment in the
Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock shall be made as the result of the issuance or

deemed issuance of Additional Stock of Common Stock if the Corporation receives the prior
written consent of the Preferred Majority agreeing that no such adjustment shall be made as the
result of the issuance or deemed issuance of such Additional Stock of Common Stock.

(C) Except to the limited extent provided for in Subsections
B.4(g)(i)(F)(3) or (4), no adjustment of the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock
pursuant to this Subsection B.4(g) shall have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price above
the Conversion Price for such series in effect immediately prior to such adjustment.

(D) In the case of the issuance of Common Stock for cash, the
consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefore before deducting any
reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the
Corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

(E) In the case of the issuance of the Common Stock for
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be
deemed to be the fair value thereof as determined by the Board irrespective of any accounting
treatment.

(F) In the case of the issuance of options to purchase or nights
to subscribe for Common Stock, securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for
Common Stock or options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or
exchangeable securities, the following provisions shall apply for all purposes of this Subsection

B.4(g):

(1) The aggregate maximum number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable upon exercise (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to
exercisability, including without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account
potential anti-dilution adjustments) of such options to purchase or rights to subscribe for
Common Stock shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such options or rights were
issued and for consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in
Subsections B.4(g)()(D) or (E)), if any, received by the Corporation upon the issuance of such
options or rights plus the minimum exercise price provided in such options or rights (without
taking into account potential anti-dilution adjustments) for the Common Stock covered thereby.

(2) The aggregate maximum number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of, or in exchange for (assuming the satisfaction of
any conditions to convertibility or exchangeability, including, without limitation, the passage of
time, but without taking into account potential anti-dilution adjustments), any such convertible or
exchangeable securities or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for
such convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof shall
be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or such options or rights

14
655645 v13/SD
were issued and for consideration equal to the consideration, if any, received by the Corporation
for any such securities and related options or rights (excluding any cash received on account of
accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the minimum additional consideration, if any, to be
received by the Corporation (without taking into account potential anti-dilution adjustments)
upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or the exercise of any related options or
rights (the consideration in each case to be determined in the manner provided in Subsections

B.4(g)(i)(D) and (E)).

(3) In the event of any change in the number of shares
of Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon exercise
of such options or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such convertible or
exchangeable securities, including, but not limited to, a change resulting from the anti-dilution
provisions thereof (unless such options or nights or convertible or exchangeable securities were
merely deemed to be included in the numerator and denominator for purposes of determining the
number of shares of Common outstanding for purposes of Subsection B.4(g)(i)(A), the
Conversion Price of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B-2 Preferred Stock and Series C
Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, rights or
securities, shall be recomputed to reflect such change, but no further adjustment shall be made
for the actual issuance of Common Stock or any payment of such consideration upon the
exercise of any such options or rights or the conversion or exchange of such securities.

(4) | Upon the expiration of any such options or rights,
the termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options or
rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities (unless such options or rights or
convertible or exchangeable securities were merely deemed to be included in the numerator and
denominator for purposes of determining the number of shares of Common outstanding for
purposes of Subsection B.4(g)(i)(A)), the Conversion Price of the Series A Preferred Stock,
Series B-2 Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected by
such options, rights or securities or options or rights related to such securities, shall be readjusted
as if such options, rights or securities or options or rights related to such securities had not been
issued.

(B) In the event the Corporation shall issue on more than one
date Additional] Stock that are a part of one transaction or a series of related transactions and that
would result in an adjustment to the Series A Conversion Price, Series B-2 Conversion Price or
Series C Conversion Price, as applicable, pursuant to the terms of Subsection B.4(g) then, upon
the final such issuance, the Series A Conversion Price, Series B-2 Conversion Price and/or Series
C Conversion Price, as applicable, shall be readjusted to give effect to all such issuances as if
they occurred on the date of the first such issuance (and without giving effect to any additional
adjustments as a result of any such subsequent issuances within such period).

(ii) “Additional Stock” shall mean any shares of Common Stock
issued (or deemed to have been issued pursuant to Subsection B.4(g)(i)(F) by the Corporation
after the Filing Date other than the following (collectively the “Exempted Securities”):

(A) Shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to a transaction
described in Subsection B.4(g)(iii) hereof;

15
655645 v13/SD
(B) Shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of the
Series A Preferred Stock, Series B-2 Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock (or the
conversion of dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock);

(C) Shares of Common Stock issued upon the exercise or
conversion, as applicable, of other stock, options, warrants convertible stock or securities
outstanding as of the Filing Date;

(D) Shares of Common Stock issuable or issued to employees,
consultants, directors or vendors (if in transactions with primarily compensatory, non-financing
purposes) of the Corporation pursuant to any stock option plans or restricted stock plan approved
by the Board or assumed pursuant to an acquisition;

(E) Shares of Common Stock or options or warrants
exercisable for Common Stock issued with the approval of the Board to banks, savings and loan
associations, equipment lessors or other similar lending institutions in connection with such
entities providing credit facilities or financing to the Corporation;

(F) Shares of Common Stock issued or issuable from time to
time pursuant to the acquisition of another business entity or business segment of any such entity
by the Corporation by merger, purchase of substantially all the assets or other reorganization
(other than a merger or other transaction described in Subsection B.2(c)); or

(G) Shares of Series C Preferred Stock and Special Voting
Stock issued pursuant to that certain Series C Preferred Stock and Special Voting Stock Purchase
Agreement dated on or about the Filing Date, by and among the Corporation and certain
purchasers named therein (the “Series C Stock Purchase Agreement”).

(iii) | In the event the Corporation should at any time or from time to
time after the Accrual Date fix a record date for the effectuation of a split or subdivision of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock or the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled
to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock or other
securities or rights convertible into, or entitling the holder thereof to receive directly or
indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock (hereinafter referred to as “Common Stock
Equivalents”) without payment of any consideration by such holder for the additional shares of
Common Stock or the Common Stock Equivalents (including the additional shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof), then, as of such record date (or the date of
such dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no record date is fixed), the Conversion Price of
the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B-2 Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock shall be
appropriately decreased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion
of each share of such Series shall be increased in proportion to such increase of the aggregate of
shares of Common Stock outstanding and those issuable with respect to such Common Stock
Equivalents with the number of shares issuable with respect to Common Stock Equivalents
determined from time to time in the manner provided for deemed issuances in Subsection

B.4(g)()(F).

16
655645 v13/SD
(iv) If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any time
after the Accrual Date is decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of Common
Stock, then, following the record date of such combination, the Conversion Price for the Series A
Preferred Stock, Series B-2 Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock shal! be appropriately
increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of
such Series shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares.

(h)  Recapitalizations. If at any time or from time to time there shall be a
recapitalization of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision, combination, reorganization or
merger or sale of assets transaction provided for elsewhere in this Subsections B.2 or 4),
_ provision shall be made so that the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B-2 Preferred
Stock and Series C Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of such
Series, in lieu of each share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion, the
number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the Corporation or otherwise, to
which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion would
have been entitled upon such recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be
made in the application of the provisions of this Subsection B.4 with respect to the rights of the
holders of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B-2 Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock after
the recapitalization to the end that the provisions of this Subsection B.4 (including adjustment of
the Conversion Price then in effect and the number of shares purchasable upon conversion of the
Series A Preferred Stock, Series B-2 Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock) shall be
applicable after that event as nearly equivalent as may be practicable.

(i) No Impairment. The Corporation shall not, by amendment of this
Certificate of Incorporation or through any reorganization, recapitalization, transfer of assets,
consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid
or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed
hereunder by the Corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all
the provisions of this Subsection B.4 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or
appropniate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holders of Preferred Stock set forth in
this Subsection B.4 against impairment.

Q) No Fractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments.

(i) No fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of the
Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would otherwise be entitled,
the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair market value of a
share of Common Stock as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation. Whether or not fractional shares would be issuable upon such conversion shall be
determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock the holder is at the time
converting into Common Stock and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such
aggregate conversion.

(ii) | Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the
Conversion Price of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B-2 Preferred Stock and Series C
Preferred Stock, pursuant to this Subsection B.4, the Corporation, at its expense, shall promptly
compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and prepare and

17
655645 vI3/SD
furnish to each holder of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B-2 Preferred Stock and Senes C
Preferred Stock, a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail
the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon the
written request at any time of any holder of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B-2 Preferred Stock
and Series C Preferred Stock, fumish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate
setting forth (A) such adjustment and readjustment, (B) the Conversion Price for such Series at
the time in effect, and (C) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of
other property that at the time would be received upon the conversion of such Series.

(k) Notices of Record Date. In the event:

(A) the Corporation shall take a record of the holders of its
Common Stock (or other capital stock or securities at the time issuable upon conversion of the
Preferred Stock) for the purpose of entitling or enabling them to receive any dividend or other
distribution, or to receive any right to subscribe for or purchase any shares of capital stock of any
class or any other securities, or to receive any other security; or

(B) of any capital reorganization of the Corporation or any
reclassification of the Common Stock of the Corporation; or

(C) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or
winding-up of the Corporation,

then, and in each such case, the Corporation will send or cause to be sent to the holders of the
Preferred Stock a notice specifying, as the case may be, (i) the record date for such dividend,
distribution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right, or (ii)
the effective date on which such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer,
dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is proposed to take place, and the time, if any is to be
fixed, as of which the holders of record of Common Stock (or such other capital stock or
securities at the time issuable upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be entitled to
exchange their shares of Common Stock (or such other capital stock or securities) for securities
or other property deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger,
transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, and the amount per share and character of such
exchange applicable to the Preferred Stock and the Common Stock. Such notice shall be sent at
least 10 days prior to the record date or effective date for the event specified in such notice.

(i) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Subsection B.4 to
be given to the holders of Preferred Stock shall be deemed given if deposited in the United States
mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to each holder of record at his address appearing on the
books of the Corporation.

5. Voting Rights.

(a) General Rights. On any matter presented to the stockholders of the
Corporation for their action or consideration at any mecting of stockholders of the Corporation
(or by written consent of stockholders in lieu of meeting) each holder of shares of Series A
Preferred Stock, Series B-2 Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock shall have the right to

18
655645 v13/SD

one vote for each share of Common Stock into which such Series A Preferred Stock, Series B-2
Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock could then be converted as of the record date for
determining stockholders entitled to vote on such matter. With respect to such vote, such holder
shall have full voting rights and powers equal to the voting rights and powers of the holders of
Common Stock, and shall be entitled, notwithstanding any provision hereof, to notice of any
stockholders’ meeting in accordance with the Bylaws of the Corporation, and shall be entitled to
vote, together with holders of Common Stock, with respect to any question upon which holders
of Common Stock have the right to vote. Fractional votes shall not, however, be permitted and
any fractional voting rights available on an as-converted basis (after aggregating all shares into
which shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder could then be converted) shall be rounded to
the nearest whole number (with one-half being rounded upward).

(b) Election of Directors.
(A) The Board shall consist of seven (7) directors.

(B) For so long as not fewer than 20% of the shares of Series C
Preferred Stock issued pursuant to the Series C Stock Purchase Agreement (subject to adjustment
for any stock split, reverse stock split or other similar event affecting the Series C Preferred
Stock after the Filing Date) remain outstanding, the holders of record of the shares of Series C
Preferred Stock and Special Voting Stock, voting together as a separate class on an as-converted
to Common Stock basis, shall be entitled to elect four (4) directors of the Corporation (the
“Series C Directors”).

(C) For so long as not fewer than an aggregate of 715,000

(F) Any director that may be elected as provided in Subsection
B.5(b) above may be removed without cause by, and only by, the affirmative vote of the holders
of the shares of the class or series of capital stock entitled to elect such director or directors,
given either at a special meeting of such stockholders duly called for that purpose or pursuant to
a written consent of stockholders. If the holders of shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock,
as applicable, fail to elect a sufficient number of directors to fill all directorships for which they
are entitled to elect directors, voting exclusively and as a separate class, pursuant to Subsection

19
655645 vI3/SD

the Preferred Stock or Common Stock, as applicable, elect a person to fill such directorship by
vote or written consent in lieu of a meeting; and no such directorship may be filled by
stockholders of the Corporation other than by the stockholders of the Corporation that are
entitled to elect a person to fill such directorship, voting exclusively and as a separate class. At
any meeting held for the purpose of electing a director, the presence in person or by proxy of the

so long as at least 20% of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock issued pursuant to the Series C

Stock Purchase Agreement (subject to adjustment for any stock split, reverse stock split or other
similar event affecting the Series C Preferred Stock after the Filing Date) remain outstanding, in
addition to any other vote or consent required herein or by law, the vote or written consent of the

equity ownership (on an as-converted to Common Stock basis and assuming the conversion of all
of the Corporation’s outstanding convertible equity and debt securities) and (ii) 9,325,616 shares
of Common Stock (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations or the like
