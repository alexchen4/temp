This corporation is authorized to issue two classes of stock, designated, respectively,
“Common Stock” and “Preferred Stock.” The total number of shares which this corporation is

of Directors is authorized to designate additional series of Preferred Stock and to fix the number of
shares of any series of Preferred Stock and to determine or alter the rights, preferences, privileges,

PALLIBINGM2\M203742.04(pst@04!. DOC) 1
and restrictions granted to or imposed upon any wholly unissued series of Preferred Stock and,
within the limits and restrictions stated in any resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors
originally fixing the number of shares constituting any series of Preferred Stock, to increase or
decrease (but not below the number of shares of any such series then outstanding) the number of
shares of any such series subsequent to the issue of shares of that series.

Immediately upon filing of this Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, each share
of the corporation’s Common Stock outstanding is split, automatically and without further action,
into two (2) shares of Common Stock, and each share of the corporation’s Preferred Stock
outstanding is split, automatically and without further action, into two (2) shares of the respective
series of said Preferred Stock (collectively, the “Stock Split”).

IV.

The rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to or imposed upon the Common
Stock and Preferred Stock are as follows:

‘A. Dividends,

1. When and as declared by the corporation's Board of Directors, the holders of
outstanding Series A Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred”), Series B Preferred Stock (“Series B
Preferred”) and Series C Preferred Stock (“Series C Preferred”) shall be entitled to receive in any
fiscal year on a pari passu basis, out of any assets at the time legally available therefor, dividends in
cash at the rate of $0.0133, $0.0356 and $0.1072 per share per annum, respectively (giving effect tc
the Stock Split and each as adjusted for any subsequent stock dividends, combination, splits,
recapitalizations and the like with respect to such shares), before any dividend is paid on Common
Stock. Dividends may be declared and paid upon Common Stock in any fiscal year of the
corporation only if dividends shall have been paid to or declared and set apart upon all shares of
Preferred Stock at such annual rate for such fiscal year of the corporation. After such dividends are
declared and paid upon the shares of Preferred Stock, dividerds may be declared and paid on the
Common Stock if at the same time equivalent dividends are declared and paid to hoiders of Preferred
Stock (such dividends to be paid as determined on an as converted basis for the Preferred Stock).

2. The right to such dividends on Preferred Stock and Common Stock shall not be
cumulative and no right shall accrue to holders of Preferred Stock or Common Stock by reason of
the fact that dividends on said shares are not declared in any prior year, nor shall any undeclared or
unpaid dividend bear or accrue interest.

B. Liguidation Preference.

1. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the corporation,
either voluntary or involuntary, the holders of the Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred and Series
C Preferred shall be entitled to receive on a pari passu basis and prior and in preference to any

each share of Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred and Series C Preferred, respectively, then held
by them, and, in addition, an amownt equal to all declared but unpaid dividends on the Series A
Preferred, Series B Preferred and Series C Preferred, respectively. If upon the occurrence of such
event, the assets and funds thus distributed among the holders of the Series A Preferred, Series B
Preferred and Series C Preferred shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the °
full aforesaid preferential amounts, then the entire assets and funds of the corporation legally
available for distribution shall be distributed among the holders of the Series A Preferred, Series B
Preferred and Series C Preferred in proportion to the full aforesaid preferential amounts to which

Stock. The holder of each share of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to notice of any shareholders’
meeting in accordance with the Bylaws of the corporation and shall vote with the holders of the
Common Stock upon any matter submitted to a vote of shareholders, except those matters required
by law to be submitted to a class vote or as otherwise provided in Section H or I of this Article IV.
Fractional votes shall not, however, be permitted, and any fractional voting rights resulting from

contrary, the shareholders entitled to elect a particular director shall be entitled to remove such
director or to fill a vacancy in the seat formerly held by such director, all in accordance with the
applicable provisions under California law.

D. Conversion. The holders of Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as follows
(the "Conversion Rights"):

1. Right to Convert. Each share of each series of Preferred Stock shall be
convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time into such number of fully paid and
nonassessable snares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Issuance Price (as defined
below) by the Conversion Price (as defined below) in effect at the time of conversion. The Issuance
Price for the Series A Preferred, the Series B Preferred and the Series C Preferred shall be $0.1665,
$0.445 and $1.34, respectively (after giving effect to the Stock Split). The Conversion Price for the
Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred and Series C Preferred shall initially be $0.1665, $0.445 and

PALLIBI\GM2\1203742.04(pst@041,DOC) 4
2. Automatic Conversion. Each share of Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred
and Series C Preferred shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the
respective Conversion Prices at the time in effect for such series of Preferred Stock immediately
upon the earlier of (i) the corporation’s sale of iis Common Stock in an underwritten public offering
pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”), which
results in the Company’s Common Stock being listed for trading on a national securities exchange or
the Nasdaq National Market; or (ii) the date specified by written consent or agreement of at least
two-thirds (2/3) of the then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, voting together as a class, to
such conversion. ,

3. Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to convert the same into full shares of Common Stock and to receive certificates therefor, he
shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the corporation
or of any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the corporation at
such office that such holder elects to convert the same; provided, however, that in the event of an
automatic conversion pursuant to Section D.2 above, the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall
be converted automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or
not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the corporation or its transfer agent,
and provided further that the corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such automatic conversion unless the certificates evidencing
such shares of Preferred Stock are either delivered to the corporation or its transfer agent as provided
above, or the holder notifies the corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost,
stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the corporation to indemnify the
corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates, The corporation shall,
as soon as practicable after such delivery, or such agreement and indemnification in the case of a lost
certificate, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which the holder shall be entitled and a
check payable to the holder in the amount of any cash amounts payable as the result of a conversion
into fractional shares of Common Stock. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made
immediateiy prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred
Stock to be converted, or in the case of automatic conversion, on the date of closing of the offering,
and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such
conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of
Common Stock on such date.

4; Fractional Shares. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder of
Preferred Stock would otherwise be entitled, the corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction
multiplied by the fair market value of one share of Preferred Stock as determined by the Board of
Directors of the corporation. Whether or not fractional shares are issuable upon such conversion
shall be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock of each holder at
the time converting into Common Stock and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
such aggregate conversion.

E. Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock for Certain Dilutive Issuances. The

respective Conversion Prices of the Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time
as follows:

PALLIBI\GM2\1203742,04(pst@04!. DOC) 5

Preferred Stock were first issued (the “Purchase Date” with respect to such series), any Additional
Stock (as defined below) the Conversion Price for such series in effect immediately prior to each
such issuance shall forthwith be adjusted to a new Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock
equal to a fraction the numerator of which shall be the sum of (A) the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding on the Purchase Date of such series, multiplied by the Issuance Price of such
series, plus (B) the aggregate consideration received by the corporation for the total number of
shares of Additional Stock so issued or sold (or deemed issued or sold); and the denominator of

deemed issued cr sold); provided, however that the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred
Stock shall at no time exceed the respective Issuance Price of such series of Preferred Stock as
adjusted for stock splits, combinations and similar acts. For the purposes hereof, the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding shall be deemed to include all shares of Common Stock
actually outstanding and all shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise, conversion or
exchange of all outstanding options, warrants and convertible securities.

(a) No adjustment of the Conversion Price for the applicable Preferred
Stock shall be made in an amount less than one cent per share, provided that any adjustments which

taken into account in any subsequent adiustment made prior to three years from the date of the event
giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward, or shali be made at the end of three years from
the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward. Except to the limited extent
provided for in subsections (d)(iii) and (d)(iv) below, no adjustment of such Conversion Price
pursuant to this sub-section E1(a) shall have the effect of increasing the applicable Conversion Price
above the applicable Conversion Price in effect immediately prior tc such adjustment.

(b) In the case of the issuance of Common Stock for cash, the
consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting any discounts,
commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by this corporation for any underwriting or
otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

(c) In the case of the issuance of the Common Stock for a consideration in
whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be deemed to be the fair
value thereof as determined by the Board of Directors irrespective of any accounting treatment.

(d) In the case of the issuance (whether before, on or after the applicable
Purchase Date) of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common Stock, securities by their
terms convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock or options to purchase or rights to

time such securities were issued or such options or rights were issued and for a consideration equal
to the consideration, if any, received by the corporation for any such securities and related options or
rights (excluding any cash received on account of accrued interest or accrued dividends}, plus the
minimum additional consideration, if any, to be received by the corporation upon the conversion or
exchange of such securities or the exercise of any related options or rights (the consideration in each
case to be determined in the manner provided in sub-section E1.)

(iii) In the event of any change in the number of shares of Common
Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to this corporation upon exercise of such options or
rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such convertible or exchangeable securities,
including, but not limited to, a change resulting from the anti-dilution provisions thereof, the
respective Conversion Prices of the applicable Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected by
or computed using such options, rights or securities, shall be recomputed to reflect such change, but
no further adjustment shall be made for the actual issuance of Common Stock or any payment of
such consideration upon the exercise of any such options or rights or the conversion or exchange of
such securities.

(iv) | Upon the expiration of any such options or rights, the
termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options or rights
related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the respective Conversion Prices of the

rights or securities or options or rights related to such securities, shall be recomputed to reflect the
issuance of only the number of shares of Common Stock (and convertible or exchangeable securities
which remain in effect) actually issued upon the exercise of such options or rights, upon the
conversion or exchange of such securities or upon the exercise of the options or rights related to such
