ARTICLE IV

4.1 Classes of Stock. The Company is authorized to issue two classes of stock to be designated, respectively,
“Common Stock” and “Preferred Stock.” The total number of shares which the Company is authorized to issue is
One Billion, Four Hundred Twenty-Four Thousand, Nine Hundred Thirteen (1,000,424,913) shares, each with a par
value of $0.001 per share. Six Hundred Million (600,000,000) shares shall be Common Stock and Four Hundred
Million, Four Hundred Twenty-Four Thousand, Nine Hundred Thirteen (400,424,913) shares shall be Preferred
Stock.

4.2 Reverse Split. Immediately upon the filing of this Certificate, each thirty (30) outstanding shares of
Common Stock and each thirty (30) outstanding shares of Preferred Stock will be exchanged and combined,
automatically and without further action, into one (1) share of Common Stock and one (1) share of Preferred Stock,
respectively (the “Reverse Split”). The Reverse Split shall be effected on a certificate-by-certificate basis and no
fractional shares shall be issued upon the exchange and combination. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the
holder would otherwise be entitled, the Company shall pay an amount of cash equal to the product of (i) the
fractional share to which the holder would otherwise be entitled and (ii) the then fair value of a share as determined
in good faith by the Board of Directors. All share and per share amounts set forth in this Certificate, including such
amounts set forth elsewhere in this Article IV, have been revised to reflect the Reverse Split, and, accordingly, no
further adjustment in accordance with the terms of this Certificate is necessary.

thereby, and whether or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Company or its transfer
agent. The Company shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock or Preferred
Stock, as the case may be, resulting from the Reverse Split unless the certificates evidencing such shares of
Common Stock or Preferred Stock are either delivered to the Company or its transfer agent as provided above, or the
holder notifies the Company or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen, or destroyed and
executes an agreement satisfactory to the Company to indemnify the Company from any loss incurred by it in
connection with such certificates. The Company shall, as soon as practicable after such delivery, or such agreement
and indemnification in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, issue and deliver at such office to such
holder of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, as the case may be, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares
of Common Stock or Preferred Stock and a check payable to the holder in the amount of any cash amounts payable
as the result of a conversion of fractional shares into cash to which he or she shall be entitled as aforesaid.

(ix) Certain Acquisitions.

(1) Deemed Liquidation. For purposes of this Section 4.3(b) and Section 4.3(f) below, a
liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company shall be deemed to occur if the Company shall sell, convey,
license, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its intellectual property, assets or business or merge
with or into or consolidate with any other Company, limited liability company or other entity (other than a wholly-
owned subsidiary of the Company) or effect any other transaction or series of related transactions in which holders
of the capital stock of the Company immediately prior to the transaction hold and control less than a majority of the
voting power of the Company immediately after such transaction, (any such transaction, a “Liquidation
Transaction”), provided that none of the following shall be considered a Liquidation Transaction: (i) a merger
effected exclusively for the purpose of changing the domicile of the Company, (ii) a bona fide equity financing in
which the Company is the surviving Company, or (iii) a transaction in which the stockholders of the Company
immediately prior to the transaction own in the same proportion 50% or more of the voting power of the surviving
Company following the transaction.

(2) Valuation of Consideration. In the event of a Liquidation Transaction, if the
consideration received by the Company is other than cash, its value will be deemed its fair market value. Any
securities shall be valued as follows:

a) Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar restrictions on free
marketability:

i) If traded on a securities exchange or The Nasdaq Stock Market
(“Nasdaq’’), the value shall be based on a formula determined in good faith by the Board of Directors and derived
from the closing prices of the securities on such exchange or Nasdaq over a specified time period;
-5-

ii) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be based on a formula
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors and derived from the closing bid or sales prices (whichever is
applicable) for such securities over a specified time period; and

iii) If there is no active public market, the value shall be the fair market
value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

b) The method of valuation of securities subject to investment letter or other
restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of a stockholder’s status as an
affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount from the market value determined as specified
above in Section 4.3(b)(ix)(2)(a) to reflect the approximate fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors.

(3) Notice of Liquidation Transaction. The Company shall give each holder of record of
Preferred Stock written notice of any impending Liquidation Transaction not later than 10 days prior to the
stockholders’ meeting called to approve such Liquidation Transaction, or 10 days prior to the closing of such
Liquidation Transaction, whichever is earlier, and shall also notify such holders in writing of the final approval of
such Liquidation Transaction. The first of such notices shall describe the material terms and conditions of the
impending Liquidation Transaction and the provisions of this Section 4.3(b), and the Company shall thereafter give
such holders prompt notice of any material changes. The Liquidation Transaction shall in no event take place sooner
than 10 days after the Company has given the first notice provided for herein or sooner than 10 days after the
Company has given notice of any material changes provided for herein. Notwithstanding the other provisions of
these Restated Articles, all notice periods or requirements in this Certificate may be shortened or waived, either
before or after the action for which notice is required, upon the written consent of the holders of a majority of the
voting power of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock that are entitled to such notice rights.

(4) Effect of Noncompliance. In the event the requirements of this Section 4.3(b)(ix) are
not complied with, the Company shall forthwith either cause the closing of the Liquidation Transaction to be
postponed until the requirements of this Section 4.3(b) have been complied with, or cancel such Liquidation
Transaction, in which event the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the holders of Preferred Stock shall
revert to and be the same as such rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions existing immediately prior to the
date of the first notice referred to in Section 4.3(b)(ix)(3).

(c) Redemption. The Preferred Stock is not-redeemable.
(d) Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as follows (the
“Conversion Rights”):

(i) Right to Convert. Subject to Section 4.3(d)(ii1), each share of Preferred Stock shall be
convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share, at the office of
the Company or any transfer agent for such stock, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Common Stock as is determined by dividing (a) $22.50 in the case of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, (b) $9.30 in
the case of the Series A-2 Preferred Stock, (c) $22.50 in the case of the Series A-3 Preferred Stock, (d) $4.53426 in
the case of the Series AA Preferred Stock, (e) $5.7738 in the case of the Series AA-1 Preferred Stock, (f) $6.6444 in
the case of the Series B Preferred Stock, (g) $7.3089 in the case of the Series B-1 Preferred Stock, (h) $9.981 in the
case of the Series C Preferred Stock, (i) $5.133 in the case of the Series D Preferred Stock, and (j) $3.666 in the case
of the Series E Preferred Stock, by the Conversion Price applicable to such share determined as hereafter provided,
in effect on the date the certificate is surrendered for conversion. The initial Conversion Price shall be $22.50 per
share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, $9.30 per share of Series A-2 Preferred Stock, $22.50 per share of Series A-3
Preferred Stock, $4.53426 in the case of Series AA Preferred Stock, $5.7738 in the case of Series AA-1 Preferred
Stock, $6.6444 in the case of the Series B Preferred Stock, and $7.3089 in the case of the Series B-1 Preferred
Stock, $9.981 in the case of the Series C Preferred Stock, $5.133 in the case of the Series D Preferred Stock, and
$3.666 in the case of Series E Preferred Stock. Such initial Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment as set
forth in Section 4.3(d)(iv).

-6-

(ii) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into
shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Price at the time in effect for such share immediately upon the earlier of
(1) the Company’s sale of its Common Stock in a firm commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to a
registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), at a pre-offering market
capitalization of at least $200,000,000 (calculated based on capital stock outstanding on an as-converted basis,
assuming conversion or exercise of all convertible or exercisable securities and including all shares reserved for
issuance pursuant to any stock option or similar plan) and which results in aggregate cash proceeds to the Company
of not less than $30,000,000 (prior to underwriting discounts and commissions) or (ii) the date specified by vote or
written consent of the holders of not less than sixty percent (60%) of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock.

(iti) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert
such Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, the holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor,
duly endorsed, at the office of the Company or of any transfer agent for such series of Preferred Stock, and shall
give written notice to the Company at its principal corporate office, of the election to convert the same and shall
state therein the name or names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued.
The Company shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred
Stock, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of
Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been
made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of such series of
Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable
upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common
Stock as of such date. If the conversion is in connection with an underwritten public offering of securities registered
pursuant to the Securities Act, the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering such Preferred Stock for
conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering,
in which event any persons entitled to receive Common Stock upon conversion of such Preferred Stock shall not be
deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of an automatic conversion pursuant to Section 4.3(d)(ii), the
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock so converted shall be converted automatically without any further action by
the holder of such shares and whether or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the
Company or the transfer agent for such Preferred Stock, provided however, that the Company shall not be obligated
to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such automatic conversion unless the
certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are either delivered to the Company or the transfer agent for
such Preferred Stock as provided above, or the holder notifies the Company or the transfer agent for such Preferred
Stock that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the
Company to indemnify the Company from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates. The
Company shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver to such address as the holder may direct, a
certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled.
-7-

(iv) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock for Certain Dilutive Issuances, Splits
and Combinations. The Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as

follows:

(1) Issuance of Additional Stock below Purchase Price. If the Company should
issue, at any time after the date of filing of this Certificate (the “Filing Date”), any Additional Stock (as defined
below) without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Conversion Price then in effect for the
Series AA Preferred Stock, Series AA-1 Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series BB-1 Preferred Stock,
Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, and Series E Preferred Stock immediately prior to the issuance
of such Additional Stock, then the Conversion Price for each such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately
prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock shall automatically be adjusted, concurrently with such issuance, as
set forth in this Section 4.3(d)(iv)(1), unless otherwise provided in this Section 4.3(d)(iv)(1).

a) Adjustment Formula. Whenever the Conversion Price for a series of Preferred
Stock is adjusted pursuant to this Section 4.3(d)(iv)(1), the new Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock
shall be determined by multiplying the Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction, (x) the numerator of which
shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance (the “Outstanding
Common’’) plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received by the Company
for such issuance would purchase at the Conversion Price then in effect for such series of Preferred Stock; and (y)
the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Outstanding Common plus the number of shares of
Additional Stock. For purposes of the foregoing calculation, the term “Outstanding Common” shall include shares of
Common Stock deemed issued pursuant to Section 4.3(d)(iv)(1)(e) below.

b) Definition of “Additional Stock”. For purposes of this Section 4.3(d)(iv)(1),
“Additional Stock” shall mean any shares of Common Stock issued (or deemed to have been issued pursuant to
Section 4.3(d)(iv)(1)(e)) by the Company after the Filing Date other than:

i) Common Stock or Common Stock Derivatives (as defined in Section
4.3(d)(iv)(1)(e) below), in each case issued pursuant to stock dividends, stock splits or similar transactions, as
described in Section 4.3(d)(iv)(2) hereof;

ii) 6,686,375 shares of Common Stock or Common Stock Derivatives
(excluding options already exercised) issued or issuable to employees, consultants or directors of the Company
pursuant to a stock option plan or restricted stock plan approved by the Board of Directors of the Company;

ii1) Common Stock or Common Stock Derivatives, issued to financial
institutions or lessors in connection with commercial credit arrangements, equipment financings, commercial
property lease transactions or similar transactions approved by the Board of Directors;

iv) Shares of Common Stock, Preferred Stock or Common Stock Derivatives
issuable upon exercise of warrants, options, notes or other rights to acquire securities outstanding as of the Filing
Date;

v) Common Stock, or Common Stock Derivatives, issued in connection with
bona fide acquisitions, mergers or similar transactions, the terms of which are approved by the Board of Directors;
-8-

vi) Shares of Series E Preferred Stock issued pursuant to the terms of that
certain Series E Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement dated on or about the Filing Date, as amended from time to
time;

vii) Shares of Common Stock issued or issuable upon conversion of
Preferred Stock;
vili) Shares of Common Stock issued or issuable in a initial public offering
prior to or in connection with which all outstanding shares Preferred Stock will be automatically converted to
Common Stock; and

ix) Common Stock or Common Stock Derivatives issued or issuable to an
entity as a component of any business relationship with such entity for the purpose of (A) joint venture, technology
licensing or development activities, (B) distribution, supply or manufacture of the Company’s products or services
or (C) any other arrangements involving corporate partners that are primarily for purposes other than raising capital,
in each case the terms of which business relationship with such entity are approved by the Board of Directors and
holders of an aggregate of at least sixty percent (60%) of the outstanding Preferred Stock, voting together as a single
class on an as-converted to Common Stock basis.

c) No Fractional Adjustments. No adjustment of the Conversion Price for the
Preferred Stock shall be made in an amount less than one hundredth of a cent per share, provided that any
adjustments which are not required to be made by reason of this sentence shall be carried forward and shall be either
taken into account in any subsequent adjustment made prior to three years from the date of the event giving rise to
the adjustment being carried forward, or shall be made at the end of three years from the date of the event giving rise
to the adjustment being carried forward.

d) Determination of Consideration. In the case of the issuance of Common Stock
for cash, the consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting any reasonable
discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the Company for any underwriting or
otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof. In the case of the issuance of the Common Stock for a
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be deemed to be the fair
value thereof as determined by the Board of Directors in good faith irrespective of any accounting treatment.

e) Deemed Issuances of Common Stock. In the case of the issuance (whether
before, on or after the Filing Date) of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common Stock, securities by
their terms convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock or options to purchase or rights to subscribe for
such convertible or exchangeable securities (collectively the “Common Stock Derivatives”), the following
provisions shall apply for all purposes of this Section 4.3(d)(iv)(1):

i) The aggregate maximum number of shares of Common Stock deliverable
upon conversion, exchange or exercise (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to convertibility,
exchangeability or exercisability, including, without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account
potential antidilution adjustments) of any Common Stock Derivatives and subsequent conversion, exchange or
exercise thereof shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such Common Stock Derivatives were issued and
for a consideration equal to the consideration, if any, received by the Company for any such securities and related
Common Stock Derivatives (excluding any cash received on account of accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus
the minimum additional consideration, if any, to be received by the Company (without taking into account potential
antidilution adjustments) upon the conversion, exchange or exercise of any Common Stock Derivatives (the
consideration in each case to be determined in the manner provided in Section 4.3(d)(iv)(1)(d)).

-9-

ii) In the event of any change in the number of shares of Common Stock
deliverable or in the consideration payable to the Company upon conversion, exchange or exercise of any Common
Stock Derivatives including, but not limited to, a change resulting from the antidilution provisions thereof, the
Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such Common
Stock Derivatives, shall be recomputed to reflect such change, but no further adjustment shall be made for the actual
issuance of Common Stock or any payment of such consideration upon the conversion, exchange or exercise of such
Common Stock Derivatives.

iii) Upon the termination or expiration of the convertibility, exchangeability
or exercisability of any Common Stock Derivatives, the Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock, to the extent in any
way affected by or computed using such Common Stock Derivatives, shall be recomputed to reflect the issuance of
only the number of shares of Common Stock (and Common Stock Derivatives that remain convertible,
exchangeable or exercisable) actually issued upon the conversion, exchange or exercise of such Common Stock
Derivatives.

iv) The number of shares of Common Stock deemed issued and the
consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to Section 4.3(d)(iv)(1)(e)(i) shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect
any change, termination or expiration of the type described in either Section 4.3(d)(iv)(1)(e)(i) or

4.3(d)(iv)(1)(e) Git).

f) No Increased Conversion Price. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Section 4.3(d)(iv)(1), except to the limited extent provided for in Sections 4.3(d)(iv)(1)(e)Gi) and
4.3(d)(iv)(1)(e)(iii), no adjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4.3(d)(iv)(1) shall have the effect
of increasing the Conversion Price above the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment.

(2) Stock Splits and Dividends. In the event the Company should at any time after the
Filing Date fix a record date for the effectuation of a split or subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock
or the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in
additional shares of Common Stock or Common Stock Derivatives without payment of any consideration by such
holder for the additional shares of Common Stock or the Common Stock Derivatives (including the additional shares
of Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof), then, as of such record date (or the date of such
dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no record date is fixed), the Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock
shall be appropriately decreased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each
share of such series shall be increased in proportion to such increase of the aggregate of shares of Common Stock
outstanding and those issuable with respect to such Common Stock Derivatives with the number of shares issuable
with respect to Common Stock Derivatives determined from time to time in the manner provided for deemed
issuances in Section 4.3(d)(iv)(1)(e).

(3) Reverse Stock Splits. If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any
time after the Filing Date is decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, then,
following the record date of such combination, the Conversion Price for the Preferred Stock shall be appropriately
increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be
decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares of Common Stock.

-10-

(v) Other Distributions. In the event the Company shall declare a distribution payable in
securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by the Company or other persons, assets (excluding
cash dividends) or options or rights not referred to in Section 4.3(d)(iv)(2), then, in each such case for the purpose of
this Section 4.3(d)(v), the holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any such
distribution as though they were the holders of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Company into which
their shares of Preferred Stock are convertible as of the record date fixed for the determination of the holders of
Common Stock of the Company entitled to receive such distribution.

(vi) Recapitalizations. If at any time or from time to time there shall be a recapitalization of the
Common Stock (other than a subdivision, combination or merger or sale of assets transaction provided for elsewhere
in this Section 4.3(d) or in Section 4.3(b)) provision shall be made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock shall
thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of such Preferred Stock the number of shares of stock or other
securities or property of the Company or otherwise, to which a holder of Common Stock deliverable upon
conversion would have been entitled on such recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be
made in the application of the provisions of this Section 4.3(d) with respect to the rights of the holders of such
Preferred Stock after the recapitalization to the end that the provisions of this Section 4.3(d) (including adjustment
of the Conversion Price then in effect and the number of shares purchasable upon conversion of such Preferred
Stock) shall be applicable after that event and be as nearly equivalent as practicable.

(vii) No Impairment. The Company will not, by amendment of this Certificate (except in
accordance with applicable law) or through any reorganization, recapitalization, transfer of assets, consolidation,
merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or
performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Company, but will at all times in
good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Section 4.3(d) and in the taking of all such action as
may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the Conversion Rights of the holders of Preferred Stock against
impairment.

(viii) No Fractional Shares and Certificates as to Adjustments.

(1) No fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of any share or shares of
Preferred Stock. In lieu of fractional shares, the Company will pay cash in an amount equal to the fair value of such
fractional shares, based on the fair market value of the shares of Common Stock, as determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors, as of the time when those who would otherwise be entitled to receive such fractional shares is
determined. The number of shares issuable upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total
number of shares of Preferred Stock the holder is at the time converting into Common Stock and the number of
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such aggregate conversion.

(2) Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the Conversion Price of
Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4.3(d), the Company, at its expense, shall promptly compute such
adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and prepare and furnish to each holder of such
Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon
which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Company shall, upon the written request at any time of any
holder of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (A) such
adjustment and readjustment, (B) the Conversion Price for the Preferred Stock at the time in effect, and (C) the
number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received
upon the conversion of a share of the Preferred Stock.

-11-

(ix) Notices of Record Date. In the event of any taking by the Company of a record of the
holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof who are entitled to receive any
dividend (other than a cash dividend) or other distribution, any right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire
any shares of stock of any class or any other securities or property, or to receive any other right, the Company shall
mail to each holder of Preferred Stock, at least 10 days prior to the date specified therein, a notice specifying the
date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or right, and the amount
and character of such dividend, distribution or right.

(x) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Company shall at all times reserve
and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting
the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock, such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time
to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of such series of Preferred Stock; and if at any
time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all then outstanding shares of such series of Preferred Stock, in addition to such other remedies as shall be
available to the holder of such Preferred Stock, the Company will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion
of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of
shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the
requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to this Certificate.

(xi) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Section 4.3(d) to be given to the
holders of shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed given if deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid,
and addressed to each holder of record at his address appearing on the books of the Company.

(e) Voting Rights

(i) Voting on an As-Converted Basis. Except as expressly provided by this Certificate or as
provided by law, the holders of Preferred Stock shall have the same voting rights as the holders of Common Stock
and shall be entitled to notice of any stockholders’ meeting in accordance with the Bylaws of the Company, and the
holders of Common Stock and the Preferred Stock shall vote together as a single class on all matters. Each holder of
Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share of Common Stock held, and each holder of Preferred
Stock shall be entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of shares of Common Stock into which such
shares of Preferred Stock could be converted. Fractional votes shall not, however, be permitted and any fractional
voting rights available on an as-converted basis (after aggregating all shares into which shares of Preferred Stock
held by each holder could be converted) shall be rounded to the nearest whole number (with one-half being rounded
upward).

(ii) Election of Directors. The Board of Directors shall consist of eight (8) members. So long as
at least 333,333 shares (as adjusted for Recapitalizations) of Series B Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the
holders of Series B Preferred, voting as a separate class, shall be entitled to elect one member of the Company’s
Board of Directors at each meeting or pursuant to each consent of the Company’s stockholders for the election of
directors. So long as an aggregate of at least 250,000 shares (as adjusted for Recapitalizations) of Series AA and
Series AA-1 Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the holders of Series AA and Series AA-1 Preferred, voting
together as a separate class, shall be entitled to elect two members of the Company’s Board of Directors at each
meeting or pursuant to each consent of the Company’s stockholders for the election of directors. So long as an
aggregate of at least 16,666 shares (as adjusted for Recapitalizations) of the Series A-1, Series A-2, and Series A-3
Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the holders of Series A-1, Series A-2, and Series A-3 Preferred, voting together
as a separate class, shall be entitled to elect one member of the Company’s Board of Directors at each meeting or
pursuant to each consent of the Company’s stockholders for the election of directors. The holders of Common Stock,
voting as a separate class, shall be entitled to elect one member of the Company’s Board of Directors at each
meeting or pursuant to each consent of the Company’s stockholders for the election of directors. The holders of
Preferred Stock and Common Stock, voting together as a single class on an as-converted to Common Stock basis,
shall elect the CEO of the Company as a member of the Company’s Board of Directors, and two additional members
of the Company’s Board of Directors at each meeting or pursuant to each consent of the Company’s stockholders for
the election of directors.

-12-

(f) Protective Provisions. The protective provisions for the Preferred Stock are as follows:

(i) So long as any shares of Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Company shall not without first
obtaining the approval (by vote or written consent, as provided by law) of the holders of at least sixty percent (60%)
of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a class:

(1) (A) amend or repeal any provision of, or add any provision to, this Certificate or the
Bylaws of the Company, or (B) otherwise alter or change the rights, preferences or privileges of the shares of any
series of Preferred Stock, by way of merger, consolidation, substitution, reclassification or otherwise, so as to affect
adversely the shares of such series;

(2) increase or decrease (other than by conversion in accordance with the provisions of
this Certificate) the total number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock;

(3) authorize or issue, or obligate itself to issue (whether by reclassification or otherwise),
(a) any other equity security, including any security convertible into or exercisable for any equity security, having a
preference over, or being on a parity with, any existing series of Preferred Stock, in right of redemption, liquidation
preference, dividends, or voting rights or (b) any increase in the authorized or designated number of any such equity
security;

(4) create any bond, note or other obligation of the Company in an aggregate principal
amount of more than $1,000,000, unless approved by all members of the Board of Directors;

(5) redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire (or pay into or set funds aside for a sinking fund
for such purpose) any share or shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock; provided, however, that this restriction
shall not apply to the repurchase at cost of shares of Common Stock from employees, officers, directors, consultants
or other persons performing services for the Company or any subsidiary pursuant to agreements approved by the
Board of Directors under which the Company has the option to repurchase such shares at cost upon the occurrence
of certain events, such as the termination of employment, or through the exercise of any right of first refusal;

(6) effect a merger or consolidation, a sale of a substantial portion of the assets of the
Company, a Liquidation Transaction, or a reclassification or recapitalization of the outstanding capital stock of the
Company;

(7) any voluntary dissolution or liquidation of the Company;
(8) pay or declare any dividend on any shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock or
declare or make any other distribution, directly or indirectly, on account of any shares of Common Stock of
Preferred Stock now or hereafter outstanding; or

-13-

(9) increase or decrease the authorized size of the Board of Directors of the Company.

(ii) For so long as at least 25% of the shares of a series of Preferred Stock remain outstanding, in
addition to any other vote or consent required herein or by law, the vote or written consent of the holders of at least a
majority of the outstanding shares of such series of Preferred Stock shall be necessary to effect any amendment,
alteration, or repeal of any provision of the Restated Articles or the Bylaws of the Company that alters or changes
the voting or other powers, preferences, or other special rights, privileges or restrictions of such series of Preferred
Stock (whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise) so as to affect that series of Preferred Stock adversely and in
a manner different from any other series of Preferred Stock (it being understood that a series of Preferred Stock shall
not be affected differently because of the proportional differences in the respective conversion prices and liquidation
preferences that arise out of differences in the original issue prices vis-a-vis other series of Preferred Stock).

(g) Status of Converted Stock. In the event any shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted pursuant
to Section 4.3(d) hereof, the shares so converted shall be cancelled and shall not be issuable by the Company. This
Certificate shall be appropriately amended to effect the corresponding reduction in the Company’s authorized capital
stock.

(h) Repurchase of Shares. In connection with repurchases by the Company at cost of shares of
Common Stock from employees, officers, directors, consultants or other persons performing services for the
Company or any subsidiary pursuant to agreements approved by the Board of Directors under which the Company
has the option to repurchase such shares at cost upon the occurrence of certain events, such as the termination of
employment, or through the exercise of any right of first refusal, Sections 502 and 503 of the California General
Company Law shall not apply in whole or in part with respect to such repurchases.

44 Rights, Preferences and Restrictions of Common Stock.

(a) Dividend Rights. Subject to the prior rights of holders of all classes of stock at the time outstanding
having prior rights as to dividends, the holders of the Common Stock shall be entitled to receive, when and as
declared by the Board of Directors, out of any assets of the Company legally available therefor, such dividends as
may be declared from time to time by the Board of Directors.

(b) Liquidation Rights. Upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, or the

(d) Voting Rights. Each holder of Common Stock shall have the right to one vote per share of Common
Stock, and shall be entitled to notice of any stockholders’ meeting in accordance with the Bylaws of the Company,
and shall be entitled to vote upon such matters and in such manner as may be provided by law.

ARTICLE VII

To the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Company Law, as the same exists or as may hereafter
be amended from time to time, a director of the Company shall not be personally liable to the Company or its
stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. If the Delaware General Company
Law is amended to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then
the liability of a director of the Company shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the
Delaware General Company Law, as so amended.

The Company shall indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any director or officer of the
Company who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action,
suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a “Proceeding”) by reason of the fact that
he or she is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or is or was serving at the request of the
Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another Company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, against expenses (including attorneys’ fees),

any such Proceeding. The Company shall be required to indemnify a person in connection with a Proceeding
initiated by such person only if the Proceeding was authorized by the Board.

The Company shall have the power to indemnify, to the extent permitted by the Delaware General Company
Law, as it presently exists or may hereafter be amended from time to time, any employee or agent of the Company
who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any Proceeding by reason of the fact that he or she is or
was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another Company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,
including service with respect to employee benefit plans, against expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments,
fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with any such
Proceeding.

Neither any amendment nor repeal of this Article, nor the adoption of any provision of this Certificate of
Incorporation inconsistent with this Article, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article in respect of any
matter occurring, or any cause of action, suit or claim accruing or arising or that, but for this Article, would accrue
or arise, prior to such amendment, repeal or adoption of an inconsistent provision.

ARTICLE VIII

Except as provided in Article VII above, the Company reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any
provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all
rights conferred upon stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.
