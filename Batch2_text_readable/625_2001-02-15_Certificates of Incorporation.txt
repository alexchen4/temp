AMENDED AND RESTATED
ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION
OF EXCHANGEWAVE, INC,

I

The name of this corporation is Aravo Solutions, Inc.

i

The purpose of this corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which a
corporation may be organized under the General Corporation Law of California other than the
banking business, the trust company business or the practice of a profession permitted to be
incorporated by the California Corporations Code,

YI

This corporation is authorized to issue two classes of stock to be designated Common Stock
and Preferred Stock. The total number of shares of Common Stock that the corporation is authorized
to issue is 20,000,000 shares, $0.001 par value. The total number of shares of Preferred Stock that
the corporation is authorized to issue is 4,585,000 shares, $0.001 par value, all of which shall be
designated Series A Preferred Stock.

Iv

The relative powers, preferences, special rights, qualifications, limitations and restrictions
granted to or imposed on the respective classes of ihe shares of capital stock or the holders thereof
ate as follows:

1, — Dividends.

(a) Preference, The holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
receive dividends, out of any assets legally available therefor, prior and in preference to any
declaration or payment of any dividend (payable other than in Common Stock or other securities and
rights conyertible into or entitling the holder thereof to receive, directly or indirectly, additional

CATEMP\PALIb2_1740945_1.DOC

shares of Common Stock of this corporation) on the Common Stock of this corporation, at the rate of
$0.05 per share per annum for the Series A Preferred Stock or, if greater (as determined on a per
annum basis and on an as converted basis for the Preferred Stock), an amount equal to that paid on
any other outstanding shares of this corporation. No dividends shall be paid on any shares of
Common Stock unless a dividend (including the amount of any dividend paid pursuant to the above
provision) is paid with respect to all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock in an amount for
each such share of Series A Preferred Stock equal to or greater than the aggregate amount of such
dividends for all shares of Common Stock into which each such share of Series A Preferred Stock
could then be converted,

(b) Dividends Noncumulative. Dividends on shares of Common Stock and
Preferred Stock under this Section 1 shall be payable when, as and if declared by the board of
directors of the corporation, and shall not be cumulative, and no right shall accrue to holders of
Common Stock or Preferred Stock under this Section 1 by reason of the fact that dividends on said
shares are not declared in any prior period.

2. Liquidation Preference. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of
the corporation, either voluntary or involuntary, distributions to the shareholders of the corporation
shall be made in the following manner:

(a) Preferred Stock Preference, The holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any distribution of any of the assets or surplus funds of
the corporation to the holders of Common Stock of the corporation, an amount equal to $0.60 per
share of Series A Preferred Stock plus a further amount equal to any dividends declared but unpaid
on such shares (subject to adjustment of such fixed dollar amount for any stock splits, stock
dividends, combinations, recapitalizations or the like) (the “Series A Preference"). If upon such
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, the assets of the corporation are insufficient
to provide for the cash payment described above to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, such
assets as are available shall be paid to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock in proportion to the
full preferential amount each such holder is otherwise entitled to receive.

(b) Remaining Assets, After payment or setting apart of payment of the Series A
Preference, the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive the remaining assets of the
corporation pro rata based upon the number of shares of Common Stock held,

(c) Reorganization or Merger. A merger or reorganization of the corporation with
or into any other corporation or corporations or a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the
corporation, in which transaction the corporation’s shareholders immediately prior to such
transaction own immediately after such transaction less than 50% of the equity securities of the
surviving corporation or its parent, shall be deemed to be a liquidation within the meaning of this
Section 2.

(4d)  Noncash Distributions. If any of the assets of the corporation ate to be
distributed other than in cash under Section IV2(c) or for any purpose, then the board of directors of
the corporation shall promptly engage independent competent appraisers to determine the value of

C:A\TEMP\PALIb2,,1740945_1.DOC 2

the assets to be distributed to the holders of Preferred Stock. The corporation shall, upon receipt of
such appraiser's valuation, give prompt written notice to each holder of shares of Preferred Stock of
the appraiser's valuation. Notwithstanding the above, any securities to be distributed to the
stockholders shall be valued as follows:

(i) If traded on a securities exchange or the Nasdaq National Market, the
value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange, or
the last reported sale prices on the Nasdaq National Market as the case may be, over the 30-day
period ending three (3) business days prior to the closing;

(ii) If actively traded over-the-counter (other than on the Nasdaq National
Market), the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid prices over the 30-day period
ending three (3) business days prior to the closing; and

Gii) If there is no active public market, the value shall be the fair market
value thereof, as determined in good faith by the board of directors of this corporation.

3. Voting Rights. Except as otherwise required by law, the holder of each share of
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of shares of Common
Stock into which each share of Preferred Stock could be converted on the record date for the vote or
written consent of shareholders and shall have voting rights and powers equal to the voting rights
and powers of the Common Stock when voting together with the Common Stock as a single class,
which shall include, but not be limited to, the election of directors. The holder of each share of
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to notice of any shareholders’ meeting in accordance with the
bylaws of the corporation and upon any other matter submitted to a vote of shareholders, except
those matters required by law to be submitted to a class vote. Fractional votes shall not, however, be
permitted and any fractional voting rights resulting from the above formula (after aggregating all
shares of Common Stock into which shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder could be
converted) shall be rounded to the nearest whole number (with one-half rounded upward to one).

(a) Election of Directors. At each election of directors, the directors shall be
elected by the holders of the Preferred Stock and Common Stock, voting together as a single class.
Such vote may be given at a special meeting of such shareholders duly called or by an action by
written consent for that purpose. Vacancies on the board of directors may be filled by a majority of
the remaining directors, though Jess than a quorum, except that a vacancy created by the removal ofa
director by court order may be filled by only the vote of the outstanding shares entitled to vote
thereon represented at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present, or by an action by written
consent for that purpose. Each director so elected shall hold office until the next annual meeting of
shareholders or until a successor has been elected and qualified. The shareholders of the specified
series or class entitled to vote upon the election of any director from which a vacancy arose may
elect a director at any time to fill such vacancy not filled by the directors.

4, Conversion, The holders of the Preferred Stock have conversion rights as follows
(the “Conversion Rights”):

CATBMP\PALIb2_1740945_1,.DOC 3

(a) Right to Convert, Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the
option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share at the office of the
corporation or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, into such number of fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Issuance Price by the
Conversion Price, determined as hereinafter provided, in effect at the time of the conversion (the
“Conversion Rate”). The Issuance Price for the Series A Preferred Stock shall be $0.60 per share,
The Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred Stock shall initially be $0.60 per share, Such initial
Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment as hereinafter provided.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be
converted into shares of Common Stock at the then effective Conversion Rate (i) immediately prior
to the closing of a firm commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration
statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, covering the offer and sale of Common
Stock for the account of the corporation to the public in which the public offering price exceeds
(prior to underwriter’s discounts or commissions and offering expenses) $2.40 per share (adjusted
for any subsequent stock splits, stock dividends, reclassifications or recapitalizations) and the
aggregate gross proceeds raised exceeds $10,000,000 or (ii) on the date upon which the corporation
obtains the consent of the holders of a majority of the shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding,
voting as a class, In the event of the automatic conversion of the Preferred Stock upon a public
offering as aforesaid, the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such
conversion of Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until
immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities.

(c) | Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to convert the same into full shares of Common Stock and to receive certificates therefor,
such holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the
corporation or of any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the
corporation at such office that such holder elects to convert the same; provided, however, that in the
event of an automatic conversion pursuant to Section [V4(b), the outstanding shares of Preferred
Stock shall be converted automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and
whether or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the corporation or its
transfer agent, and provided further that the corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates
evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such automatic conversion unless the
certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are either delivered to the corporation or its
transfer agent as provided above, or the holder notifies the corporation or its transfer agent that such
certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the
corporation to indemnify the corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such
certificates. The corporation shall, as soon as practicable after such delivery, or such agreement and
indemnification in the case of a lost certificate, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of
Preferred Stock, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which the
holder shall be entitled as aforesaid and a check payable to the holder in the amount of any cash
amounts payable as the result of a conversion into fractional shares of Common Stock. Such
conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date
of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, or in the case of automatic

CATEMP'PALib2_1740945_1.DOC 4

conversion on the date of closing of the offering and the person or persons entitled to receive the
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the
record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date.

(d) Fractional Shares, In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder of
Preferred Stock would otherwise be entitled, the corporation may pay cash equal to such fraction
multiplied by the then effective Conversion Price or round such fractional share up to a whole share
(after aggregating all shares into which shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder could be
converted), Whether or not fractional shares are issuable upon such conversion shall be determined
on the basis of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock of each holder at the time converting
into Common Stock and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such aggregate
conversion.

(e) Adjustment of Conversion Price. The Conversion Price of Preferred Stock
shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

(i) If the corporation shall issue (or, pursuant to Section IV4(e)(i)(C)(Z)
hereof, shall be deemed to have issued) any Common Stock other than “Excluded Stack” (as defined
below) for a consideration per share less than the Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock
in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Common Stock (excluding stock dividends,
subdivisions, stock splits, combinations, dividends or recapitalizations which are covered by
Sections IV4(e)(iiit) IV4(e)(iv), and IV4(e)(v)) (the “Additional Shares”), the Conversion Price for
such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately after each such issuance of Additional Shares
’ shall forthwith (except as provided in this Section [V4(e)) be adjusted to a price (calculated to the
nearest cent) equal to the product obtained by multiplying the Conversion Price for such series of
Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such issuance of Additional Shares by a fraction,

(A) the numerator of which is equal to the sum of

(x) the total number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding (including any shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of or exercise of, as
the case may be, outstanding Preferred Stock, options, warrants or other convertible securities, or
deemed to be issued pursuant to Section 1V4(e)(i)(C)(z)) immediately prior to such issuance of
Additional Shares, plus

ty) the number of shares of Common Stack that the

aggregate consideration received by this Corporation for such issuance of Additional Shares would

purchase at the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to
such issuance of Additional Shares; and

{B) the denominator of which is equal to the sum of

(x) the total number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding (including any shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of or exercise of, as
the case may be, outstanding Preferred Stock, options, warrants or other convertible securities, or

CATEMP\PALib2_1740945_1,.DOC 5

deemed to be issued pursuant to Section IV4(e)(i)(C)(z)) immediately prior to such issuance of
Additional Shares, plus

{y) the number of shares of Additional Shares issued.

(C) For the purposes of any adjustment of the Conversion Price for
any series of Preferred Stock pursuant to this clause (i), the following provisions shall be applicable:

(x) In the case of the issuance of Common Stock for cash,
the consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor after deducting any
discounts or commissions paid or incurred by the corporation in connection with the issuance and
sale thereof.

(y) In the case of the issuance of Common Stock for 4
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be deemed
to be the fair value thereof as reasonably determined by the board of directors of the corporation, in
accordance with generally accepted accounting treatment; provided, however, that if, at the time of
such determination, the corporation’s Common Stock is traded in the over-the-counter market or on
a national or regional securities exchange, such fair market value as determined by the board of
directors of the corporation shall not exceed the aggregate “Current Market Price” (as defined
below) of the shares of Common Stock being issued.

(z) In the case of the issuance of (i) options to purchase or
rights to subscribe for Common Stock, (ii) securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable
for Common Stock, or (iii) options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or
exchangeable securities:

(1) the aggregate maximum number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon
exercise of such options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common Stock
shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such options or rights were
issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the
manner provided in subdivisions (x) and (y) above), if any, received by the
corporation upon the issuance of such options or rights plus the minimum
purchase price provided in such options or rights for the Common Stock
covered thereby;

(2) the aggregate maximum number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon
conversion of or in exchange for any such convertible or exchangeable
securities, or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for
such convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or
exchange thereof, shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such
securities were issued or such options or rights were issued and for a
consideration equal to the consideration received by the corporation for any
such securities and related options or rights (excluding any cash received on
account of accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the additional

CATEMPA\PALIb2_1740945_1.DOC 6

minimum consideration, if any, to be received by the corporation upon the
conversion or exchange of such securities or the exercise of any related
options or rights (the consideration in each case to be determined in the
manner provided in subdivisions (x) and (y) above);

(3) on any change in the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon
exercise of any such options or rights or conversion of or exchange for such
convertible or exchangeable securities, or on any change in the minimum
purchase price of such options, rights or securities, other than a change
resulting from the antidilution provisions of such options, rights or securities,
the Conversion Price shall forthwith be readjusted to such Conversion Price as
would have obtained had the adjustment made upon (x) the issuance of such
options, rights or securities not exercised, converted or exchanged prior to
such change or (y) the options or rights related to such securities not converted
or exchanged prior to such change, as the case may be, been made upon the
basis of such change; and

(4) on the expiration of any such options or rights, the termination of any such
rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options or rights related
to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Conversion Price shall
forthwith be readjusted to such Conversion Price as would have obtained had
the adjustment made upon the issuance of such options, rights, convertible or
exchangeable securities or options or rights relate to such convertible or
exchangeable securities, as the case may be, been made upon the basis of the
issuance of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually issued upon
the exercise of such options or rights, upon the conversion or exchange of
such convertible or exchangeable securities or upon the exercise of the options
ot rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, as the case
may be.

Preferred Stock) shali be deemed to be outstanding for all purposes of the computations of
Section IV4(e)(i) above.

(iii) If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any time
after the date hereof is increased by a stock dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or by a
subdivision or split-up of shares of Common Stock, then, on the date such payment is made or such
change is effective, the Conversion Price of Preferred Stock shall be appropriately decreased so that
the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of any shares of Preferred Stock shall
be increased in proportion to such increase of outstanding shares.

(iv) If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any time
after the date hereof is decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of Common Stock,
then, on the effective date of such combination, the Conversion Price of Preferred Stock shall be
appropriately increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of
any shares of Preferred Stock shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares.

{v) In case, at any time after the date hereof, of any capital reorganization,
or any reclassification of the stock of the corporation (other than as a result of a stock dividend or
subdivision, split-up or combination of shares), or the consolidation or merger of the corporation
with or into another person (other than a consolidation or merger in which the corporation is the
continuing entity and which does not result in any change in the Common Stock or a consolidation
or merger where Section 2 applies), the shares of Preferred Stock shall, after such reorganization,
reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale or other disposition, be convertible into the kind and
number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the corporation or otherwise to which
such holder would have been entitled if immediately prior to such reorganization, reclassification,

day as furnished by the National Quotation Bureau, Incorporated (or eqhivalent recognized source of
quotations); provided, however, that if the Common Stock is not traded in such manner that the

CATEMP\PALib2_1740945_1,.D0C 8
