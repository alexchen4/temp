Preferred Stock” and six million eight hundred twenty-six thousand seven hundred seventy-six
(6,826,776) shares are designated as “Series B Preferred Stock”.

B. Rights, Preferences and Restrictions of Preferred Stock. The rights,

preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to and imposed on the Preferred Stock are as set
forth below in this Article [V(B).

1. Dividend Provisions.

(a) Preferred Stock Dividends. The holders of shares of Preferred Stock shall
be entitled to receive dividends (“Accruing Dividends”), out of any assets legally available
therefor, prior and in preference to any declaration or payment of any dividend (payable other
than solely in Common Stock) on the Common Stock of this corporation, at the applicable
Dividend Rate (as defined below), compounded annually. Such dividends shall be cumulative
and shall accrue on each share of Preferred Stock from day to day, whether or not earned or
declared. For purposes of this subsection 1(a), “Dividend Rate” shall mean $0.1065 per annum
for each share of Series Al Preferred Stock and $0.1065 per annum for each share of Series B
Preferred Stock (each as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, combinations,
subdivisions, recapitalizations or the like).

(b) After payment of the Accruing Dividends to the holders of the Preferred
Stock, any additional dividends or distributions shall be distributed among all holders of
Common Stock and Preferred Stock in proportion to the number of shares of Common Stock that
would be held by each such holder if all shares of Preferred Stock were converted to Common
Stock pursuant to the provisions of subsection 4(a) hereof (without giving effect to the issuance
of Common Stock in such conversion pursuant to clause (ii) of the first sentence of subsection

4(a)).
2. Liquidation Preference.
(a) In the event of any Liquidation Event (as defined below), either voluntary

or involuntary, the holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, prior and in
preference to any distribution of the proceeds of such Liquidation Event (the Proceeds”) to the

GDS VF&HA\2 10935 1.1 2
holders of Series Al Preferred Stock and Common Stock by reason of their ownership thereof,
an amount per share equal to the sum of (i) the applicable Liquidation Amount (as defined
below), (ii) all unpaid Accruing Dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock, whether or not
declared, plus (iti) declared but unpaid dividends on such shares pursuant to subsection 1(b);
provided, however, that if, upon the occurrence of a Liquidation Event, either voluntary or
involuntary, the Proceeds to be distributed among the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock
shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full aforesaid preferential
amounts, then the entire Proceeds legally available for distribution shall be distributed ratably
among the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock in accordance with the shares of Series B
Preferred Stock held by such holders.

(b) After payment has been made to the holders of Series B Preferred Stock of
the full preferential amount to which they shall be entitled as set forth in Section 2(a) above, the
holders of Series Al Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any
distribution of the Proceeds to the holders of Common Stock by reason of their ownership
thereof, an amount per share equal to the sum of (i) the applicable Liquidation Amount (as
defined below), (ii) all unpaid Accruing Dividends on the Series Al Preferred Stock, whether or
not declared, plus (iii) declared but unpaid dividends on such shares pursuant to subsection 1(b);
provided, however, that if, upon the occurrence of a Liquidation Event, either voluntary or
involuntary, the Proceeds to be distributed among the holders of the Series Al Preferred Stock
shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full aforesaid preferential
amounts, then the entire Proceeds legally available for distribution shall be distributed ratably
among the holders of the Series Al Preferred Stock in accordance with the shares of Series Al
Preferred Stock held by such holders. For purposes of this Tenth Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, “Liquidation Amount” shall mean $1.775 per share for each share of
the Series Al Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, combinations,
subdivisions, recapitalizations or the like) and $1.775 per share for each share of the Series B
Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, subdivisions,
recapitalizations or the like).

(c) Upon completion of the distribution required by subsections (a) and (b) of
this Section 2, all of the remaining Proceeds shall be distributed among the holders of Preferred
Stock and Common Stock pro rata based on the number of shares of Common Stock held by
each (assuming full conversion of all such Preferred Stock pursuant to the provisions of
subsection 4(a) hereof) until, with respect to each series of Preferred Stock, such holders have
received the applicable Participation Cap (as defined below); thereafter, if Proceeds remain, the
holders of Common Stock of this corporation shall receive all of the remaining Proceeds pro rata
based on the number of shares of Common Stock held by each. For purposes of this Tenth
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, “Participation Cap” shall mean $5.325 for
the Series Al Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, combinations,
subdivisions, recapitalizations or the like with respect to such series of Preferred Stock), which
includes amounts paid pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section 2 and $5.325 for the Serics B
Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, subdivisions,
recapitalizations or the like with respect to such series of Preferred Stock), which includes
amounts paid pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section 2.

GDS VP &1H\2109351.1 3
(d) Notwithstanding the above, for purposes of determining the amount each
holder of shares of Preferred Stock is entitled to receive with respect to a Liquidation Event, such
amount shall not include all unpaid Accruing Dividends with respect to such series of Preferred
Stock if, upon such Liquidation Event, such holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
receive pursuant to subsections (a) or 1(b) above, excluding amounts attributable to any unpaid
Accruing Dividends with respect to such series of Preferred Stock, an aggregate amount of at
least three (3) times the applicable Liquidation Amount per share of such series of Preferred
Stock.

(e) (i) For purposes of this Section 2, a “Liquidation Event” shall include
(A) the closing of the sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of this
corporation’s assets, (B) the consummation of the merger or consolidation of this corporation
with or into another entity (except a merger or consolidation in which the holders of capital stock
of this corporation immediately prior to such merger or consolidation continue to hold at least
50% of the voting power of the capital stock of this corporation or the surviving or acquiring
entity), (C) the closing of the transfer (whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise), in one
transaction or a series of related transactions, to a person or group of affiliated persons (other
than an underwriter of this corporation’s securities), of this corporation’s securities if, after such
closing, such person or group of affiliated persons would hold 50% or more of the outstanding
voting stock of this corporation (or the surviving or acquiring entity) or (D) a liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of this corporation; provided, however, that a transaction shall not
constitute a Liquidation Event if its sole purpose is to change the state of this corporation’s
incorporation or to create a holding company that will be owned in substantially the same
proportions by the persons who held this corporation’s securities immediately prior to such
transaction. Notwithstanding the prior sentence, the sale of shares of Preferred Stock in a
financing transaction shall not be deemed a “Liquidation Event.” The treatment of any particular
transaction or series of related transactions as a Liquidation Event may be waived by the vote or
written consent of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding Preferred Stock (voting together
as a single class and not as separate series, and on an as-converted basis).

(i1) In any Liquidation Event, if Proceeds received by this corporation
or its stockholders is other than cash, its value will be deemed its fair market value. Fair market
value for this purpose shall be calculated as follows:

(A) Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar
restrictions on free marketability covered by (B) below:

(1) If traded on a securities exchange or through the
Nasdaq National Market, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the
securities on such exchange or system over the twenty (20) trading-day period ending three (3)
trading days prior to the closing of the Liquidation Event;

(2) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall
be deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the
twenty (20) trading-day period ending three (3) trading days prior to the closing of the
Liquidation Event; and

GDSVF&H\2109351.1 4
(3) If there is no active public market, the value shall be
the fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Board of Directors of this
corporation and the holders of at least two-thirds of the then outstanding shares of Preferred
Stock (voting together as a single class and not as separate series, and on an as-converted basis).

(B) The method of valuation of securities subject to investment
letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of
a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount
from the market value determined as above in (A) (1), (2) or (3) to reflect the approximate fair
market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Board of Directors of this corporation and
the holders of at least two-thirds of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (voting
together as a single class and not as separate series, and on an as-converted basis).

(C) The foregoing methods for valuing non-cash consideration
to be distributed in connection with a Liquidation Event may be superceded by any
determination of such value set forth in the definitive agreements governing such Liquidation
Event.

(iii) ‘In the event the requirements of this Section 2 are not complied
with, this corporation shall forthwith either:

(A) cause the closing of such Liquidation Event to be
postponed until such time as the requirements of this Section 2 have been complied with; or

(B) cancel such transaction, in which event the rights,
preferences and privileges of the holders of the Preferred Stock shall revert to and be the same as
such rights, preferences and privileges existing immediately prior to the date of the first notice
referred to in subsection 2(e)(iv) hereof.

(iv) This corporation shall give each holder of record of Preferred
Stock written notice of such impending Liquidation Event not later than twenty (20) days prior to
the stockholders’ meeting called to approve such transaction, or twenty (20) days prior to the
closing of such transaction, whichever is earlier, and shall also notify such holders in writing of
the final approval of such transaction. The first of such notices shall describe the material terms
and conditions of the impending transaction and the provisions of this Section 2, and this
corporation shall thereafter give such holders prompt notice of any material changes. The
transaction shall in no event take place sooner than twenty (20) days after this corporation has
given the first notice provided for herein or sooner than ten (10) days after this corporation has
given notice of any material changes provided for herein; provided, however, that subject to
compliance with the General Corporation Law such periods may be shortened or waived upon
the written consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the then outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class and not as separate series, and on an as-
converted basis).

3, Redemption.

(a) This corporation will, to the extent it may lawfully do so and subject to the
conditions set forth below, within ninety (90) days after the receipt by this corporation of a

GDS VIF&H\2109351.1 5
written request from the holders of at least two-thirds of the then outstanding Preferred Stock
made on or after July 16, 2018 that all of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock be
redeemed, redeem in three (3) annual installments (each payment date being referred to herein as
a “Redemption Date”) the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock by paying in cash therefor
a sum per share (the “Redemption Price”) equal to the greater of (A) (i) the applicable
Liquidation Amount for such shares of Preferred Stock plus (ii) all applicable Accruing
Dividends for such shares of Preferred Stock accrued but unpaid thereon, whether or not
declared, plus (iii) any other declared but unpaid dividends on such shares pursuant to subsection
1(b) or (B) the applicable Fair Market Value (as defined below), The number and series of
shares of Preferred Stock that this corporation shall be required to redeem on any one
Redemption Date shall be equal to the amount determined by dividing (i) the aggregate number
of shares of such series of Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Redemption
Date by (ii) the number of remaining Redemption Dates (including the Redemption Date to
which such calculation applies). Any redemption of a series of Preferred Stock effected pursuant
to this subsection 3(a) shall be made on a pro rata basis among the holders of such series of
Preferred Stock in proportion to the aggregate Redemption Price each such holder of Preferred
Stock would otherwise be entitled to receive on the applicable Redemption Date. For purposes
of this Section 3, the “Fair Market Value” shall mean with respect to the Series Al Preferred
Stock the fair market value of a share of Series Al Preferred Stock as of the date of the written
notice delivered pursuant to subsection 3(b) as determined by the Board of Directors of this
corporation and two-thirds of the then outstanding shares of Series Al Preferred Stock and with
respect to the Series B Preferred Stock the fair market value of a share of Series B Preferred
Stock as of the date of the written notice delivered pursuant to subsection 3(b) as determined by
the Board of Directors of this corporation and two-thirds of the then outstanding shares of Series
B Preterred Stock. If such parties cannot agree on the applicable Fair Market Value for such
series of Preferred Stock, the fair market value of a share of such series of Preferred Stock shall
be determined by an appraiser (the “Appraiser”) who is a senior member of the American
Society of Appraisers experienced in the appraisal of software companies or a nationally
recognized investment banker who is an NASD member and is experienced in the appraisal of
software companies. The applicable Fair Market Value for such series of Preferred Stock shall
be calculated by the Appraiser without regard for any restrictions on liquidity or the nature of
any minority interest, but shall reflect the relative rights and privileges of the applicable series of
Preferred Stock. The fees of the Appraiser shall be paid by this corporation. The applicable Fair
Market Value pursuant to this subsection 3({a) shall be determined within sixty (60) days of the
date of the redemption request.

(b) At least fifteen (15) but no more than thirty (30) days prior to each
Redemption Date, written notice shall be mailed, first class postage prepaid, to each holder of
record (at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is
given) of Preferred Stock, at the address last shown on the records of this corporation for such
holder, notifying such holder of the redemption to be effected on the applicable Redemption
Date, specifying the number and series of the shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed from
such holder, the Redemption Price and the place at which payment may be obtained and calling
upon such holder to surrender to this corporation, in the manner and at the place designated, his,
her or its certificate or certificates representing the shares to be redeemed (the “Redemption
Notice”). Except as provided in subsection (3)(c), on or after each Redemption Date, each
holder of Preferred Stock on such Redemption Date shall surrender to this corporation the

GDSVF&H\2109351.1 6
certificate or certificates representing such shares, in the manner and at the place designated in
the Redemption Notice, and thereupon the applicable Redemption Price of such shares shall be
payable to the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the
owner thereof and each surrendered certificate shall be cancelled. In the event less than all the
shares represented by any such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued
representing the unredeemed shares.

(c) From and after each Redemption Date, unless there shall have been a
default in payment of the Redemption Price, all rights of the holders of shares of Preferred Stock
designated for redemption on such Redemption Date in the Redemption Notice as holders of
Preferred Stock (except the right to receive the applicable Redemption Price without interest
upon surrender of their certificate or certificates) shall cease with respect to such shares, and
such shares shall not thereafter be transferred on the books of this corporation or be deemed to be
outstanding for any purpose whatsoever. If the funds of this corporation legally available for
redemption of shares of Preferred Stock on a Redemption Date are insufficient to redeem the
total number of shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such date, those funds that are
legally available will be used to redeem the maximum possible number of such shares ratably
among the holders of such shares to be redeemed in proportion to the aggregate Redemption
Price that each such holder would be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3(a). The shares of
Preferred Stock not redeemed shall remain outstanding and entitled to all the rights and
preferences provided herein (including the right to Accruing Dividends which shall continue to
accrue and compound until such shares of Preferred Stock are redeemed). At any time thereafter
when additional funds of this corporation are legally available for the redemption of shares of
Preferred Stock, such funds will immediately be used to redeem the balance of the shares that
this corporation has become obliged to redeem on any Redemption Date but that it has not
redeemed.

(d) On or prior to each Redemption Date, this corporation shall deposit the
Redemption Price of all shares of Preferred Stock designated for redemption on such
Redemption Date in the Redemption Notice, and not yet redeemed or converted, with a bank or
trust corporation having aggregate capital and surplus in excess of $100,000,000 as a trust fund
for the benefit of the respective holders of the shares designated for redemption and not yet
redeemed, with irrevocable instructions and authority to the bank or trust corporation to publish
the notice of redemption thereof and pay the Redemption Price for such shares to their respective
holders on or after the Redemption Date, upon receipt of notification from this corporation that
such holder has surrendered his, her or its share certificate to this corporation pursuant to
subsection (3)(b) above. As of the date of such deposit (even if prior to the Redemption Date),
the deposit shall constitute full payment of such shares to their holders, and from and after the
date of the deposit, the shares so called for redemption shall be redeemed and shall be deemed to
be no longer outstanding, and the holders thereof shall cease to be stockholders with respect to
such shares and shall have no rights with respect thereto except the rights to receive from the
bank or trust corporation payment of the Redemption Price for the shares, without interest, upon
surrender of their certificates therefor. Such instructions shall also provide that any moneys
deposited by this corporation pursuant to this subsection (3)(d) for the redemption of shares
which are subsequently converted into shares of this corporation’s Common Stock pursuant to
Article IV(B)(4) hereof prior to the Redemption Date shall be returned to this corporation
forthwith upon such conversion. The balance of any moneys deposited by this corporation

GDS VF&H\2109351.1 7
pursuant to this subsection (3)(d) remaining unclaimed at the expiration of two (2) years
following any such Redemption Date shall thereafter be returned to this corporation upon its
request expressed in a resolution of its Board of Directors.

4. Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion
rights as follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, as
provided in subsection 4(b), at any time after the date of issuance of such share and on or prior to
the fifth day prior to the Redemption Date, if any, as may have been fixed in any Redemption
Notice with respect to such share of the Preferred Stock, and without payment of any additional
consideration thereof, at the office of this corporation or any transfer agent for such stock, into
the sum of (i) such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is
determined by dividing the Original Issue Price (as defined below) for such series by the
applicable Conversion Price for such series, determined as hereafter provided, in effect on the
date the certificate is surrendered for conversion. The initial Conversion Price for each series of
Preferred Stock shall be the Original Issue Price applicable to such series; provided, however,
that the Conversion Price for the Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in
subsection 4(d), “Original Issue Price” shall mean $1.775 per share for each share of Series Al
Preferred Stock and $1.775 per share for each share of Series B Preferred Stock (each as adjusted
for any stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, subdivisions, recapitalizations or the like).

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically
be converted into shares of Common Stock into which such Preferred Stock is convertible
pursuant to subsection 4(a) immediately upon the earlier of (i) this corporation’s sale of its
Common Stock in a firm commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to a registration
statement on Form S-1 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (A) the public offering
price of which was not less than three (3) times the Liquidation Amount per share applicable to
the Series B Preferred Stock, (B) the net proceeds of which were not less than $25,000,000 and
(C) after which the Common Stock of this corporation is listed on the New York Stock Exchange
or the Nasdaq Global Market (a “Qualified Public Offering”) or (ii) the date specified by written
consent or agreement of the holders of two-thirds of the then outstanding shares of Preferred
Stock (voting together as a single class and not as separate series, and on an as-converted basis).

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. On or after the date of occurrence of any
conversion of Preferred Stock pursuant to subsection 4(b), and in any event within ten (10) days
after receipt of notice, by mail, postage prepaid from this corporation of the occurrence of such
event, each holder of record of shares of Preferred Stock being converted shall surrender such
holder’s certificates evidencing such shares at the office of this corporation or of any transfer
agent for the Preferred Stock specified by this corporation, and shall thereupon be entitled to
receive certificates evidencing the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of
Preferred Stock are converted and cash as provided in subsection 4(g) in respect of any fraction
of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion. On the date of the
occurrence of any conversion of Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 4(b), each holder of record
of shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion, notwithstanding that the certificates representing such shares of
Preferred Stock shall not have been surrendered to this corporation, that notice from. this

GDSVF&H\2109351.] g
corporation shall not have been received by any holder of record of shares of Preferred Stock or
that the certificates evidencing such shares of Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered
to such holder.

(d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock for Certain Dilutive
Issuances, Splits and Combinations. The Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock shall be
subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

(i) (A)If this corporation shall issue, on or after the date upon which
this Tenth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation is accepted for filing by the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the “Filing Date’), any Additional Stock (as defined
below) without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Conversion Price
applicable to a series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such
Additional Stock, the Conversion Price for each series in effect in effect immediately prior to
each such issuance shall forthwith (except as otherwise provided in this clause (i)) be adjusted to
a price determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which
shall be the number of shares of Common Stock Outstanding (as defined below) immediately
prior to such issuance plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate
consideration received by this corporation for such issuance would purchase at applicable
Conversion Price; and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock
Outstanding (as defined below) immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares of
such Additional Stock. For purposes of this Section 4(d)(i)(A), the term “Common Stock
Outstanding” shall mean and include the following: (1) outstanding Common Stock, (2)
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock issued or issuable pursuant to
that certain Series Al Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement dated February 17, 2009, that certain
Series Al Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement dated April 25, 2011 or that certain Series Al
Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement dated July 3, 2012 (together, the “Series Al Preferred
Stock Purchase Agreements”) or that certain Series B Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement dated
on or about the Filing Date (the “Series B Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement” and together
with the Series Al Preferred Stock Purchase Agreements, the “Stock Purchase Agreements”), (3)
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of stock options issued under this corporation’s 2003
Stock Plan (the “2003 Stock Plan”) and (4) Common Stock issuable upon exercise (and, in the
case of warrants, if any, to purchase Preferred Stock, conversion) of warrants. Shares described
in (1) through (4) above shall be included whether vested or unvested, whether contingent or
non-contingent and whether exercisable or not yet exercisable.

(B) No adjustment of the Conversion Price for the Preferred
Stock shall be made in an amount less than $0.00001 per share, provided that any adjustments
that are not required to be made by reason of this sentence shall be carried forward and shall be
either taken into account in any subsequent adjustment made prior to three (3) years from the
date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward, or shall be made at the end
of three (3) years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward.
Except to the limited extent provided for in subsections (E)(3) and (E)(4), no adjustment of the
Conversion Price pursuant to this subsection 4(d)(i) shall have the effect of increasing the
Conversion Price above the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the adjustment,
however, that in no event will the Conversion Price for a series of Preferred Stock be increased

GDS VF&H\2109351.1 9
about the applicable Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock on the original issuance
date of such series of Preferred Stock.

(C) Inthe case of the issuance of Additional Stock for cash, the
consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting any
reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by this
corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

(D) In the case of the issuance of the Additional Stock for a
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be
deemed to be the fair market value thereof as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors
of this corporation, or if the holders of at least two-thirds of the then outstanding Preferred Stock
(voting together as a single class and not as separate series, and on an as-converted basis)
request, as determined by independent accountants of recognized standing promptly selected by
this corporation to value such property, whereupon such value shall be given to such
consideration and shall be recorded on the books of this corporation with respect to receipt of
such property. In the case of the issuance of the Additional Stock together with other shares or
securities or other assets of this corporation for consideration which covers both, the
consideration for such Additional Stock shall be deemed to be the proportion of such
consideration received for such Additional Stock computed as provided in subsection (C) and
this subsection (D), as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(E) In the case of the issuance of options to purchase or rights
to subscribe for Common Stock, securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for
Common Stock or options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or
exchangeable securities, the following provisions shall apply for purposes of determining the
number of shares of Additional Stock issued and the consideration paid therefor:

(1) The aggregate maximum number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable upon exercise (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to
exercisability, including without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account
potential antidilution adjustments) of such options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common
Stock shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such options or rights were issued and for
a consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in subsections
4(d)(i)(C) and (d)()(D)), if any, received by this corporation upon the issuance of such options
or rights plus the minimum exercise price provided in such options or rights (without taking into
account potential antidilution adjustments) for the Common Stock covered thereby.

(2) The aggregate maximum number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of, or in exchange (assuming the satisfaction of any
conditions to convertibility or exchangeability, including, without limitation, the passage of time,
but without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) for, any such convertible or
exchangeable securities or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for
such convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof shall
be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or such options or rights
were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration, if any, received by this
corporation for any such securities and related options or rights (excluding any cash received on

GDS VF&H\2109351.1 10
account of accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the minimum additional consideration, if
any, to be received by this corporation (without taking into account potential antidilution
adjustments) upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or the exercise of any related
options or rights (the consideration in each case to be determined in the manner provided in
subsections 4(d)(i)(C) and (d)(i)(D)).

(3) In the event of any change in the number of shares
of Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to this corporation upon exercise
of such options or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such convertible or
exchangeable securities, the applicable Conversion Price for the such series of Preferred Stock,
to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, rights or securities, shall be
recomputed to reflect such change, but no further adjustment shall be made for the actual
issuance of Common Stock or any payment of such consideration upon the exercise of any such
options or rights or the conversion or exchange of such securities.

(4) Upon the expiration of any such options or rights,
the termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options or
rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the applicable Conversion Price for
the such series of Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such
options, rights or securities or options or rights related to such securities, shall be recomputed to
reflect the issuance of only the number of shares of Common Stock (and convertible or
exchangeable securities that remain in effect) actually issued upon the exercise of such options or
rights, upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or upon the exercise of the options or
rights related to such securitics.

(5) The number of shares of Additional Stock deemed
issued and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to subsections 4(d)(i)(E)(1) and (2)
shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or expiration of the type
described in either subsection 4(d)(i)(E)(3) or (4).

(ii) | “Additional Stock” shall mean any shares of Common Stock
issued (or deemed to have been issued pursuant to subsection 4(d)(i)(E)) by this corporation on
or after the Filing Date other than:

(A) Common Stock issued pursuant to a transaction described
in subsection 4(d)(iii) hereof:

(B) Up to four million fifty-three thousand eighty-five
(4,053,085) shares of Common Stock (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends,
combinations, subdivisions, recapitalizations or the like) issued to employees, directors,
consultants and other service providers for the primary purpose of soliciting or retaining their
services pursuant to the 2003 Stock Plan;

(C) Common Stock issued pursuant to the conversion or
exercise of convertible or exercisable securities outstanding on the Filing Date;

GDS VF&H\2109351.1 11
(D) Common Stock issued or deemed issued pursuant to
subsection 4(d)(i)(E) as a result of a decrease in the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred
Stock resulting from the operation of Section 4(d);

(E) | Common Stock issued to persons or entities with which this
corporation has business relationships, provided such issuances are for other than primarily
equity financing purposes and are approved by the holders of at least two-thirds of the then
outstanding Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class and not as separate series, and on
an as-converted basis); or

(F) | Common Stock issued pursuant to any equipment leasing
arrangement or debt financing from a bank or similar institution, provided such financing is
primarily for non-equity purposes and is approved by the holders of at least two-thirds of the
then outstanding Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class and not as separate scries, and
on an as-converted basis).

(iii) In the event this corporation should at any time or from time to
time after the Filing Date fix a record date for the effectuation of a split or subdivision of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock or the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled
to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock or other
securities or rights convertible into, or entitling the holder thereof to receive directly or
indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock (hereinafter referred to as “Common Stock
Equivalents”) without payment of any consideration by such holder for the additional shares of
Common Stock or the Common Stock Equivalents (including the additional shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof), then, as of such record date (or the date of
such dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no record date is fixed), the Conversion Price
for the Preferred Stock shall be appropriately decreased so that the number of shares of Common
Stock issuable on conversion shall be increased in proportion to such increase of the aggregate of
shares of Common Stock outstanding and those issuable with respect to such Common Stock
Equivalents with the number of shares issuable with respect to Common Stock Equivalents
determined from time to time in the manner provided for deemed issuances in subsection

4(d)(i)(E).

(iv) If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any time
after the Filing Date is decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of Common Stock,
then, following the record date of such combination, the Conversion Price for the Preferred Stock
shall be appropriately increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on
conversion shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares.

(e) Other Distributions. In the event this corporation shall declare a
distribution payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by this
corporation or other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred
to in subsection 4(d)(iii), then, in each such case for the purpose of this subsection 4(e), the
holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any such distribution as
though they were the holders of the number of shares of Common Stock of this corporation into
which their shares of Preferred Stock are convertible as of the record date fixed for the

GDSVE&H\2109351.1 12
determination of the holders of Common Stock of this corporation entitled to receive such
distribution.

(f) Recapitalizations. If at any time or from time to time there shall be a
recapitalization of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision, combination or merger or sale
of assets transaction provided for elsewhere in this Section 4 or in Section 2) provision shall be
made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon
conversion of their shares of Preferred Stock the number of shares of stock or other securities or
property of this corporation or otherwise, to which a holder of Common Stock deliverable upon
conversion would have been entitled on such recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate
adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 4 with respect to the
rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock after the recapitalization to the end that the provisions
of this Section 4 (including adjustment of the Conversion Price then in effect and the number of
shares purchasable upon conversion of Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event as
nearly equivalently as may be practicable.

(g) No Fractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments.

(1) No fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of any
share or shares of the Preferred Stock and the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock to
be issued to particular stockholders, shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share and the
corporation shall pay in cash the fair market value of any fractional shares as determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors of this corporation. Whether or not fractional shares would be
issuable upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of
Preferred Stock the holder is at the time converting into Common Stock and the number of
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion.

(ii) | Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the
Conversion Price of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4, this corporation, at its expense,
shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and
prepare and furnish to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment
or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is
based. This corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of Preferred
Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (A) such
adjustment and readjustment, (B) the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock at the
time in effect, and (C) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other
property that at the time would be received upon the conversion of a share of Preferred Stock.

(h) Notices of Record Date. In the event of any taking by this corporation of a
record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof
who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend) or other distribution, this
corporation shall mail to each holder of Preferred Stock, at least ten (10) days prior to the date
specified therein, a notice specifying the date on which any such record is to be taken for the
purpose of such dividend or distribution, and the amount and character of such dividend or
distribution.

GDS VIF&H\2109351.1 13
(1) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. This corporation shall at
all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock,

solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock, such
number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, in addition to such other remedies as shall
be available to the holder of such Preferred Stock, this corporation will take such corporate
action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes,
including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval
of any necessary amendment to this Tenth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

(j) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Section 4 to be
given to the holders of shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed given if deposited in the United
States mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to each holder of record at his address appearing on
the books of this corporation.

(k) Waiver of Adjustment to Conversion Price. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, any downward adjustment of the Conversion Price of any series of

Preferred Stock may be waived, either prospectively or retroactively and either generally or in a
particular instance, by the consent or vote of the holders of two-thirds of the then outstanding
shares of such series of Preferred Stock. Any such waiver shall bind all future holders of shares
of such series of Preferred Stock.

5, Voting Rights.

(a) General Voting Rights. The holder of each share of Preferred Stock shall
have the right to one vote for each share of Common Stock into which such Preferred Stock
could then be converted, and with respect to such vote, such holder shall have full voting rights
and powers equal to the voting rights and powers of the holders of Common Stock, and shall be
entitled, notwithstanding any provision hereof, to notice of any stockholders’ meeting in
accordance with the Bylaws of this corporation, and except as provided in subsection 5(b) below
with respect to the election of directors by the separate class vote of the holders of Common
Stock, shall be entitled to vote, together with holders of Common Stock, with respect to any
question upon which holders of Common Stock have the right to vote. Fractional votes shall not,
however, be permitted and any fractional voting rights available on an as-converted basis (after
aggregating all shares into which shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder could be
converted) shall be rounded to the nearest whole number (with one-half being rounded upward).

(b) Voting for the Election of Directors. As long as at least 2,000,000 shares
of Series Al Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, combinations,
subdivisions, recapitalizations or the like) remain outstanding, the holders of such shares of
Series Al Preferred Stock shall be entitled to elect two (2) directors of this corporation (the
“Preferred Directors”) at any election of directors. The holders of Preferred Stock and Common
Stock (voting together as a single class and not as separate series, and on an as-converted basis)
shall be entitled to elect any remaining directors of this corporation.

GDS VF&H\2109351.1 14
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 223(a)(1) and 223(a)(2) of the General
Corporation Law, any vacancy, including newly created directorships resulting from any
increase in the authorized number of directors or amendment of this Tenth Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation, and vacancies created by removal or resignation of a
director, may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, though less than a quorum, or
by a sole remaining director, and the directors so chosen shall hold office until the next annual
election and until their successors are duly elected and shall qualify, unless sooner displaced;
provided, however, that where such vacancy occurs among the directors elected by the holders of
a class or series of stock, any such vacancy will be filled by the holders of such class or series of
stock by (i) voting for their own designee to fill such vacancy at a meeting of the Company’s
stockholders or (ii) written consent, if the consenting stockholders hold a sufficient number of
shares to elect their designee at a meeting of the stockholders. Any director may be removed
during his or her term of office, either with or without cause, by, and only by, the affirmative
vote of the holders of a two-thirds of the shares of the class or series of stock entitled to elect
such director or directors, given either at a special meeting of such stockholders duly called for
that purpose or pursuant to a written consent of stockholders, and any vacancy thereby created
may be filled by a vote of the holders of two-thirds of that class or series of stock represented at
the meeting or pursuant to written consent.
