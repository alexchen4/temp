Stock shall be $3.50 (which amount in each case shall be subject to equitable adjustment

Preferred Stock equal to the Series C Accreted Value in accordance with Section 2 hereof.

3. Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as
follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert: Series A Conversion Price. Each share of Series A Preferred

thereof and at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such
share, at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for the Series A Preferred Stock, into
such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by
dividing $0.20687242 by the Series A Conversion Price, determined as hereinafter provided, in
effect at the time of conversion. The Series A Conversion Price at which shares of Common
Stock shall be deliverable upon conversion without the payment of any additional consideration
by the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall initially be $0.20687242 per share (the “Series A
Conversion Price’). The initial Series A Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment, in
order to adjust the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Series A Preferred Stock
is convertible, as hereinafter provided.

(b) Right to Convert; Series B Conversion Price. Each share of Series B Preferred
Stock shall be convertible, without the payment of any additional consideration by the holder

thereof and at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such

such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by

GDS VF&H‘823723.7 6
dividing $4.00 by the Series B Conversion Price. determined as hereinafter provided, in effect at
the time of conversion. The Series B Conversion Price at which shares of Common Stock shall
be deliverable upon conversion without the payment of any additional consideration by the
holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall initially be $4.00 per share (the “Series B Conversion
Price’). The initial Series B Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment, in order to adjust
the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Series B Preferred Stock is convertible,
as hereinafter provided.

(c) Right to Convert; Series C Conversion Price. Each share of Series C Preferred

Stock shall be convertible. without the payment of any additional consideration by the holder
thereof and at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such
share, at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for the Series C Preferred Stock, into
such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by
dividing $3.50 by the Series C Conversion Price, determined as hereinafter provided, in effect at
the time of conversion. The Series C Conversion Price at which shares of Common Stock shall
be deliverable upon conversion without the payment of any additional consideration by the
holders of Series C Preferred Stock shall initially be $3.50 per share (the “Series C Conversion
Price”). The initial Series C Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment, in order to adjust
the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Series C Preferred Stock is convertible.
as hereinafter provided.

(d) Automatic Conversion. Each share of each series of Preferred Stock shall
automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the then effective applicable
Conversion Price (as used herein, the term “applicable Conversion Price” means, with respect to
the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series A Conversion Price as then in effect, in the case of the
Series B Preferred Stock, the Series B Conversion Price as then in effect and in the case of the
Series C Preferred Stock, the Series C Conversion Price as then in effect) (i) with respect to
shares of Series A Preferred Stock, upon the written election of holders of at least two-thirds of
the Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding. voting as a single class (the “Series A Conversion
Election’); (ii) with respect to shares of Series B Preferred Stock, upon the written election of
holders of at least a majority of the Series B Preferred Stock then outstanding, voting as a single
class (the “Series B Conversion Election”); (iii) with respect to shares of Series C Preferred
Stock, upon the written election of holders of at least a majority of the Series C Preferred Stock
then outstanding, voting as a single class (together with the Series A Conversion Election and
Series B Conversion Election, each is hereinafter an “Automatic Conversion Election’); or (iv)
the closing of a public offering, underwritten by an investment banking firm approved by the
holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding, pursuant
to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, covering the
offer and sale of Common Stock for the account of the Corporation to the public at an initial
price per share of Common Stock of not less than $6.00 (subject to equitable adjustment in the
event of any stock split, stock dividend, combination, reclassification of shares or other similar
event affecting the Common Stock) and with gross proceeds to the Corporation of not less than
$75,000,000 (a “Qualifying Initial Public Offering’). In the event of a Qualifying Initial Public
Offering, the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of
the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted their Preferred Stock until the closing
of the Qualifying Initial Public Offering.

GDS VF&H\823723.7 7
Upon the effective date of an Automatic Conversion Election or the closing of the Qualifying
Initial Public Offering, those shares of Preferred Stock with respect to which such Automatic
Conversion Election shall have been made or all shares of Preferred Stock with respect to a
Qualifying Initial Public Offering (as the case may be), shall be converted automatically without
any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates representing
such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent; provided, however, that the
Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion unless certificates evidencing such shares of the Preferred Stock
being converted are either delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent. or the holder of such
shares notifies the Corporation or any transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen,
or destroyed and executes an agreement reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify
the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection therewith. Upon the automatic
conversion of the Preferred Stock, the holders of such Preferred Stock shall surrender the
certificates representing such shares at the office of the Corporation or of its transfer agent.
Thereupon, there shall be issued and delivered to such holder, promptly at such office and in his
name as shown on such surrendered certificate or certificates, a certificate or certificates for the
number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of the Preferred Stock surrendered
were convertible on the date on which such automatic conversion occurred. No fractional shares
of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of the Preferred Stock. In lieu of any
fractional shares to which the holder would otherwisc be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash
equal to such fraction multiplied by the then effective applicable Conversion Price.

(e) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled
to convert the same into full shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the certificate
or certificates therefor, duly endorsed for transfer or with duly executed stock transfer powers
sufficient to permit transfer attached, at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for
the Preferred Stock (or such holder shall notify the Corporation or any transfer agent that such
certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and shall execute an agreement reasonably
satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in
connection therewith), and shall give written notice to the Corporation at such office that such
holder elects to convert the same and shall state therein such holder’s name or the name or names
of such holder’s nominees in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of
Common Stock to be issued. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon
conversion of the Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would
otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the then
effective applicable Conversion Price. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter,
issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock. or to such holder’s nominee or
nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such
holder shall be entitled as aforesaid, together with cash in lieu of any fraction of a share. Except
as set forth in the second paragraph of Section 3(c), such conversion shall be deemed to have
been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the
certificates for the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled
to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion shall be treated for all purposes
as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date.

(calculated assuming conversion of all issued and outstanding shares of Preferred Stock and the
exercise, exchange or conversion of all other then outstanding Options and Convertible
