to the public so long as (x) the number of fully diluted shares outstanding prior to such closing
multiplied by the “price to the public” in the final prospectus is not less than $250,000,000 and (y)
aggregate offering proceeds are equal to or greater than $50,000,000 (prior to deduction of
underwriting discounts and commissions) (with at least $25,000,000 of such gross proceeds being
attributable to shares sold by the Company in such offering) or (11) the written consent of the
holders of more than 50% of the then outstanding voting power of the shares of Preferred Stock,

upon such conversion of Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred.
Stock until immediately prior to the IPO Closing Date. :

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be

the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Company or of any transfer
agent for the Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the Company at such office that such
holder elects to convert the same; provided, however, that in the event of a conversion pursuant to
Section 4(b), the outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically without
any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates representing such
shares are surrendered to the Company or its transfer agent; and provided further, that the Company

CNemp\notes7D6A82\Alien_ Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation_(PALIB2_3560058_8) (2).DOC -13-
shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon
such conversion unless the certificates evidencing such shares of the Preferred Stock are either
delivered to the Company or its transfer agent as provided above, or the holder notifies the
Company or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes
an agreement satisfactory to the Company to indemnify the Company for losses incurred as a result
of the loss of such certificates. The Company shall, as soon as practicable after such delivery, or
such agreement and indemnification in the case of a lost certificate, issue and deliver at such office
to such holder of the Preferred Stock, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of
Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid and a check payable to the holder
in the amount of any cash amounts payable as the result of a conversion into fractional shares of
Common Stock. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the
close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of the Preferred Stock to be converted,
or, in the case of automatic conversion, on the date of closing of the offering or the effective date of
such written consent, as the case may be, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder

Common Stock after the Event Date or other than in an Approved Financing prior to the Event Date,
without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Series I Conversion Price in
effect on the date of and immediately prior to such issue, then and in such event the Series I
Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue to a price (calculated to the nearest
cent) determined by multiplying the Series I Conversion Price theretofore in effect by a fraction, the
numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior
to such issue (not including shares excluded from the definition of Additional Shares of Common
Stock by Section 4(d)(i)(D)(2) hereof) plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the
aggregate consideration received by the Company for the total number of Additional Shares of
Common Stock so issued would purchase at such Series I Conversion Price, and the denominator of
which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue
(not including shares excluded from the definition of Additional Shares of Common Stock by
Section 4(d)(i)(D)(2) hereof) plus the number of such Additional Shares of Common Stock so
issued; provided that, for the purposes of this Section 4(d)(ii), all shares of Common Stock issued or

be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue (not
including shares excluded from the definition of Additional Shares of Common Stock by
Section 4(d)(i)(D)(2) hereof) plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate
consideration received by the Company for the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock
so issued would purchase at the applicable Conversion Price, and the denominator of which shall be
the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue (not including
shares excluded from the definition of Additional Shares of Common Stock by Section 4(d)(i)(D)(2)
hereof) plus the number of such Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued; provided that, for
the purposes of this Section 4(d)(ii), all shares of Common Stock issued or issuable upon conversion
of the then outstanding Preferred Stock shall be deemed to be outstanding.

to and including the date of conversion, retained such securities receivable by them as aforesaid
during such period, subject to all other adjustments called for during such period under this Section 4
with respect to the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock.

Substitution. If at any time or from time to time the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the
Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of any other class or
classes of stock, whether by recapitalization, capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise
(other than a subdivision, combination of shares or merger or sale of assets transaction provided for
above or in Section 2(b)), the Conversion Rate of each series of Preferred Stock then in effect shall,
concurrently with the effectiveness of such recapitalization, reorganization or reclassification, be
