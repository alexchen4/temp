twenty trading day period ending three trading days prior to the closing of the Liquidation Event;

B) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the
twenty trading day period ending three trading days prior to the closing of the Liquidation Event; and

market value thereof, as reasonably determined in good faith by the Board of Directors (which
such determination shall include the approval of the directors elected by the holders of each series of
Preferred Stock having the right to elect directors hereunder).

Gi) The method of valuation of securities subject to investment letter
or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of a stockholder’s
Status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shal] be to make an appropriate discount from the market value
determined to reflect the approximate fair market value thereof, as reasonably determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors (with such determination including the approval of the directors elected by the holders of
each series of the Preferred Stock).

(iii) | The foregoing methods for valuing non-cash consideration to be
distributed in connection with a Liquidation Event may be superseded by any determination of such value
set forth in the definitive agreements governing such Liquidation Event.

with, this Corporation shall forthwith either:

(i) cause the closing of such Liquidation Event to be postponed
until such time as the requirements of this Section 4.2.2 have been complied with; or

(ii) cancel such transaction, in which event the rights, preferences

(h) This Corporation shall give each holder of record of Preferred Stock

written notice of such impending Liquidation Event not later than twenty days prior to the stockholders’
meeting called to approve such transaction, or twenty days prior to the closing of such transaction, whichever

is earlier, and shall also notify such holders in writing of the final approval of such transaction. The first of
such notices shall describe the material terms and conditions of the impending transaction and the provisions
of this Section 4.2.2, and this Corporation shall thereafter give such holders prompt notice of any material
changes. The transaction shall in no event take place sooner than twenty days after this Corporation has
given the first notice provided for herein or sooner than ten days after this Corporation has given notice of any
material changes; provided, however, that subject to compliance with the DGCL such periods may be
shortened upon the written consent of the holders of Preferred Stock that represent at least a majority of
the voting power of all then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class and
not as separate series, and on an as-converted basis).

(i) This Corporation shall not have the power to effect a Liquidation Event
unless the agreement or plan of merger or consolidation for such transaction provides that the
consideration payable to the stockholders of the Corporation shall be allocated among the holders of
capital stock of the Corporation in accordance with Sections 4.2.2.

4.2.3 Redemption.

(a) At any time after July 25, 2015, but within ninety days after the receipt

single class on an as-converted basis), that all of the then-outstanding shares of Series E, Series D, Series B
and Series A Preferred Stock be redeemed, this Corporation shall, to the extent it may lawfully do so, redeem in
twelve equal quarterly installments (each payment date being a “Redemption Date”) the then-outstanding
shares of Series E, Series D, Series B and Series A Preferred Stock by paying in cash therefor a sum per
share equal to the greater of (i) fair market value (as determined by an independent appraiser selected by
holders of a majority of the shares of Series E, Series D, Series B and Series A Preferred Stock being
redeemed (voting together as a single class on an as-converted basis) and acceptable to the Corporation),

Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, subdivisions,
recapitalizations or the like effected after the Filing Date) plus all declared but unpaid dividends on such
shares (such greater amount, the “Redemption Price”); provided, however, in no case shall any Series A
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock or Common Stock be redeemed prior
to full redemption of the Series E Preferred Stock; provided, further, in no case shall any Series A
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Common Stock be redeemed prior to the full redemption of
the Series D Preferred Stock. To facilitate such Series E Preferred Stock redemption priority, this
Corporation may either (i) accelerate payment of the Redemption Price to the holders of Series E
Preferred Stock, and/or (ii) postpone payment of the Redemption Price on the Series A, Series B or Series
D Preferred Stock until after the full Series E Preferred Stock Redemption Price has been paid in full.
Furthermore, to facilitate such Series D Preferred Stock redemption priority, this Corporation may either

postpone payment of the Redemption Price on the Series A or Series B Preferred Stock until after the full
Series D Preferred Stock Redemption Price has been paid in ful], The number of shares of Series E, Series

Redemption Date shall be equal to the amount determined by dividing (x) the aggregate number of shares
of Series E, Series D, Series B and Series A Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to such
Redemption Date by (y) the number of remaining Redemption Dates (including the Redemption Date to
which such calculation applies). Any redemption of Series E, Series D, Series B and Series A Preferred
Stock effected pursuant to this Section 4.2.3(a) shall be made on a pro mta basis among the holders of
Series E, Series D, Series B and Series A Preferred Stock in proportion to the aggregate Redemption Price
that each such holder of Series E, Series D, Series B and/or Series A Preferred Stock is entitled to receive
on the applicable Redemption Date.

WEST\21849196.4 6
() At least fifteen but no more than thirty days prior to cach Redemption
Date, written notice shall be mailed, first class postage prepaid, to each holder of record (at the close of
business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given) of the Series E, Series D,
Series B and/or Series A Preferred Stock, at the address last shown on the records of this Corporation for such
holder, notifying such holder of the redemption to be effected on the applicable Redemption Date, specifying
the number and series of shares of Series E, Series D, Series B and/or Series A Preferred Stock to be
redeemed from such holder, the Redemption Prices for each series of Series E, Series D, Series B and/or
Series A Preferred Stock and the place at which payment may be obtained and calling upon such holder to
surrender to this Corporation, in the manner and at the place designated, his, her or its certificate or
certificates representing the shares to be redeemed (the “Redemption Notice”). Except as provided in
Section 4.2.3(c), on or after each Redemption Date, each holder of Series E, Series D, Series B and/or
Series A Preferred Stock on such Redemption Date shal! surrender to this Corporation the certificate or
certificates representing such shares, in the manner and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice, and
thereupon the applicable Redemption Price of such shares shall be payable to the order of the person whose name

cancelled. HH less than all the shares represented by any such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate
shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares.

tendered for payment or deposited with an independent payment agent so as to be available therefor and

Redemption Date in the Redemption Notice as holders of Series E, Series D, Series B and/or Series A
Preferred Stock (except the right to receive the applicable Redemption Price without interest upon surrender of
their certificate or certificates) shal] cease with respect to such shares, and such shares shall not thereafter be
transferred on the books of this Corporation or be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose whatsoever. If
the funds of this Corporation legally available for redemption of shares of Series E, Series D, Series B and
Series A Preferred Stock on a Redemption Date are insufficient to redeem the total number of shares of Series
E, Series D, Series B and Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such date, those funds that are legally
available will be paid ratably among the holders of such shares to be redeemed in proportion to the
aggregate Redemption Price that each such holder would be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 4.2.3(a).
The shares of Series E, Series D, Series B and Series A Preferred Stock not redeemed shall remain
outstanding and entitled to all the rights and preferences provided herein. At any time thereafter when

the shares that this Corporation has become obliged to redeem on any Redemption Date but that it has not
redeemed.

benefit of the respective holders of the shares designated for redemption and not yet redeemed, with
irrevocable instructions and authority to the bank or trust corporation to publish the notice of redemption thereof
and pay the Redemption Price for such shares to their respective holders on or after the Redemption Date, upon
receipt of notification from this Corporation that such holder has surrendered his, her or its share certificate to
this Corporation pursuant to Section 4.2.3(b). As of the date of such deposit (even if prior to the
Redemption Date), the deposit shall constitute full payment of such shares to their holders, and from and after
the date of the deposit, the shares so called for redemption shall be redeemed and shall be deemed to be no
longer outstanding, and the holders thereof shal] cease to be stockholders with respect to such shares and shall
have no rights with respect thereto except the rights to receive from the bank or trust corporation payment of

WEST\21849196.4 7

the Redemption Price for the shares, without interest, upon surrender of their certificates therefor. Such
instructions shall also provide that any moneys deposited by this Corporation pursuant to this Section 4.2.3(d)
for the redemption of shares converted into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 4.2.4 prior to the
Redemption Date shall be returned to this Corporation pursuant to this Section 4.2.3(d) remaining

Corporation upon its request expressed in a resolution of the Board of Directors.

4.2.4 Conversion. The holders of each series of Preferred Stock shall have conversion
rights as follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at
the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share, at the office of this
Corporation or any transfer agent for such stock, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Common Stock as is determined by dividing (x) the applicable Original Issue Price for such series plus all
declared dividends that are accrued and unpaid as of the time of conversion by (y) the applicable Conversion
Price for such series (the conversion rate for a series of Preferred Stock into Common Stock is herein referred to
as the “Conversion Rate” for such series), determined as hereafter provided, in effect on the date the certificate
for such shares is surrendered for conversion. The initial Conversion Price per share for the Series A, Series B,
Series C and Series E Preferred Stock shall be the Original Issue Price applicable to each such series and the
Conversion Price for the Series D Preferred Stock shall be $2.3401721; provided, however, that the Conversion
Price for the Preferred Stock shall be subject to further adjustment as set forth in Section 4.2.4(d).

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically
be converted into shares of Common Stock at the applicable Conversion Rate at the time in effect, plus
that number of shares of Common Stock equal to all declared dividends that are accrued and unpaid as of the
time of conversion divided by the then current Conversion Price, immediately upon the earlier of (i) this
Corporation's sale of Common Stock in a firm commitment underwritten public offering, pursuant to a
registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), where the
Corporation’s registered securities are to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock
Exchange or The Nasdaq Global Select Market, the Nasdaq Global Market or the Nasdaq Capita! Market,
the public offering price of which is not less than three times the applicable Original Issue Price for each
series of Preferred Stock (as adjusted to reflect subsequent stock dividends, stock splits, recapitalizations
or the like effected after the Filing Date) and with aggregate proceeds of at least $30,000,000 (a “Qualified
Public Offering”) or (ii) the date specified by written consent or agreement of the holders of (A) a majority
of the then outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock (voting on an as-converted basis), (B) a majority of
the then outstanding shares of Series A, Series B, Series C and Series E Preferred Stock (voting together as a
single class, and on an as-converted basis) and (C) at least two-thirds of the then outstanding shares of Series E
Preferred Stock (voting on an as-converted basis).

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to voluntarily convert the same into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 4.2.4(a), such
holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor (or an affidavit of lost certificate), duly endorsed, at
the office of this Corporation or of amy transfer agent for Preferred Stock and shall give written notice to
the Corporation at its principal corporate office, of the election to convert the same and shall state therein the
name or names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued. This
Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred
Stock, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of
Common Stock to which such holder shal] be entitled as aforesaid. Such conversion shall be deemed to have
been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred
Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon
such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common

WEST1\21849196.4 8
Stock as of such date. If the conversion is in connection with an underwritten offering of securities registered
pursuant to the Securities Act, the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering Preferred Stock for
conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to such
offering, in which event the persons entitled to receive the Common Stock upon conversion of the Preferred
Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock unti] immediately prior to the closing of
such sale of securities. If the conversion is in connection with Automatic Conversion provisions of clause (ii)
of Section 4.2.4(b), such conversion shal! be deemed to have been made on the conversion date described in
the stockholder consent approving such conversion, and the persons entitled to receive shares of Common
Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holders of such shares of
Common Stock as of such date.

(d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred k for Certain Dilutive
Ss, Spli Combinations. The Conversion Price of Preferred Stock shall be subject to
adjustment from time to time as follows:

(i) If this Corporation shall issue any Additional Stock without
consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Conversion Price applicable to a series of Preferred
Stock in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock, the Conversion Price for such
series in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall forthwith be adjusted to a price determined
by (except as otherwise provided in this Section 4.2.4(d)(ii) below) multiplying such Conversion Price by
a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock Outstanding (as defined
below) immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate
consideration received by this Corporation for such issuance would purchase at such Conversion Price; and the
denominator of which shal] be the number of shares of Common Stock Outstanding immediately prior to

(2) Common Stock issuable upon conversion of outstanding Preferred Stock, (3) Common Stock issuable

subsequent adjustment made prior to three years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being
carried forward, or shal] be made at the end of three years from the date of the event giving rise to the
adjustment being carried forward. Except to the limited extent provided for in Sections 4.2.4(dXviXC),
4.2.4(dXviXD) and 4.2.4(dix), no adjustment of such Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4.2.4(d)
shall have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price above the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior
to such adjustment.

(iii) In the case of the issuance of Additional Stock for cash, the
consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting any reasonable
discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by this Corporation for any
underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

(iv) In the case of the issuance of Additional Stock for a
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be deemed to be

minimum exercise price provided in such options or rights (without taking into account potential anti-

Stock deliverable upon conversion of, or in exchange (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions

securities or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or
exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof shal] be deemed to have
been issued at the time such securities were issued or such options or rights were issued and for a
consideration equal to the consideration, if any, received by this Corporation for any such
securities and related options or rights (excluding any cash received on account of accrued
interest or accrued dividends), plus the minimum additional consideration, if any, to be received
by this Corporation (without taking into account potential anti-dilution adjustments) upon the

payment of such consideration upon the exercise of any such options or rights or the conversion or
exchange of such securities.

termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options or rights
related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the applicable Conversion Price of Preferred
Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, rights or securities or
options or rights related to such securities, shall be recomputed to reflect the issuance of only the

ARTICLE 10

This Corporation renounces any interest or expectancy of this Corporation in, or in being offered

or which otherwise comes into the possession of, (a) any director of this Corporation who is not an
employee of this Corporation, (b) any holder of Preferred Stock or any partner, member, director,
stockholder, employee or agent of any of such holder’s affiliates (collectively “Covered Persons”) (unless

ARTICLE 11

In connection with repurchases by this Corporation of its Common Stock from employees,
officers, directors, advisors, consultants or other persons performing services for this Corporation or any
subsidiary pursuant to agreements under which the Corporation has the option to repurchase such shares at
cost upon the occurrence of certain events, such as the termination of employment, Sections 502 and 503 of
the California Corporations Code shall not apply in all or in part with respect to such repurchases.

No person entitled to vote at an election for directors may cumulate votes to which such person is
entitled, unless, at the time of such election, the Corporation is subject to Section 2115 of the California
Corporation Code. During such time or times that the Corporation is subject to Section 2115(b) of the
California Corporation Code, every stockholder entitled to vote at an election for directors may cumulate
such stockholder’s votes and give one candidate a number of votes equal to the number of directors to be
elected multiplied by the number of votes to which such stockholder’s shares are otherwise entitled, or
distribute the stockholder’s votes on the same principle among as many candidates as such stockholder
desires. No stockholder, however, shal! be entitled to so cumulate such stockholder’s votes unless (a) the
names of such candidate or candidates have been placed in nomination prior to the voting and (b) the stockholder
has given notice at the meeting, prior to the voting, of such stockholder’s intention to cumulate such
stockholder’s votes. If any stockholder has given proper notice to cumulate votes, all stockholders may
cumulate their votes for any candidates who have been properly placed in nomination. Under cumulative
voting, the candidates receiving the highest number of votes, up to the number of directors to be elected, are
elected. During such time or times that the Corporation is subject to Section 2115(b) of the California
Corporation Code, one or more directors may be removed from office at any time without cause by the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote for that
director as provided above; provided, however, that unless the entire Board of Directors is removed, no
individual director may be removed when the votes cast against such director’s removal, or not consenting in
writing to such removal, would be sufficient to elect that director if voted cumulatively at an election
which the same total] number of votes were cast (or, if such action is taken by written consent, all shares
entitled to vote were voted) and the entire number of directors authorized at the time of such director's
most recent election were then being elected.
