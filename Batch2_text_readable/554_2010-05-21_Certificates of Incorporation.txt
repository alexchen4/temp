of Preferred Stock who received payment of their Deemed Conversion
Threshold Amount in lieu of converting such shares to Common Stock
pursuant to subsection C(e)(ii) shal! be deemed to have converted all of
their shares of such series of Preferred Stock into Common Stock as of the
date of the Deemed Liquidation Event (a “Deemed Conversion”).

(B) Upon a Deemed Conversion of a series of Preferred Stock,
any Deferred Consideration payable after the Deemed Conversion
Threshold Amount for such series of Preferred Stock has been reached,
subject to the liquidation priorities of the other series of Preferred Stock
pursuant to this subsection C(d), shall be distributed on a pari passu basis
based upon the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding
(including the shares of Preferred Stock converted to Common Stock
pursuant to a Deemed Conversion pursuant to this subsection C(d)(v)), on
an as-converted to Common Stock basis.

(C) For purposes of this subsection C(d)(v), the “Deemed
Conversion Threshold Amount”) shall equal the Series A Liquidation
Preference for Series A Preferred Stock, the Series B Liquidation
Preference for Series B Preferred Stock, the Maximum Series C
Participation Amount for Series C Preferred Stock, the Maximum Series D
Participation Amount for Series D Preferred Stock, and the Maximum
Series E Participation Amount for Series E Preferred Stock.

13
(vi) Non-Cash Assets. If any of the assets of the Corporation are to be
distributed under this subsection (C)(d), or for any purpose, in a form other than
cash, then the board of directors of the Corporation shall promptly and reasonably
determine in good faith the fair market value of the assets to be distributed to the
holders of preferred stock or common stock. The Corporation shall, upon receipt
of such determination, give prompt written notice of the determination to each
holder of shares of preferred stock or common stock. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the fair market value of any securities shall be valued as follows:

(A) Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar
restrictions on free marketability:

(1)  Iftraded on a securities exchange, the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing sale prices of the securities
on such exchange over the 30-calendar day period ending three
calendar days prior to the consummation of a liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation;

(2) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall
be deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices
(whichever is applicable) over the 30-calendar day period ending
three calendar days prior to the consummation of a liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation; or

(3)  Ifthere is no active public market, the value shall be
the fair market value thereof, as determined by a majority of the
board of directors of the Corporation in good faith.

(B) The method of valuation of securities subject to investment
letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions
arising solely by virtue of a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former
affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount from the market value
determined as above in subsection (C)(d)(vi)(A)(1), (2) or (3) to reflect the
approximate fair market value thereof, as determined by a majority of the
board of directors of the Corporation in good faith.

(e) Conversion of Preferred Stock.

(i) Mandatory Conversion of Preferred Stock. The Series A Preferred
Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Stock, Series D Preferred Stock and

Series E Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of Common
Stock, without any act by the Corporation or the holders of the Series A Preferred
Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred
Stock and Series E Preferred Stock, upon the earlier of:

(A) for all series of Preferred Stock, concurrently with the
closing of the first firm commitment underwritten public offering by the
Corporation of shares of Common Stock pursuant to a registration

14
statement on Form S-1 (or similar successor form) under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, in which the aggregate public offering price of
the securities sold for cash by the Corporation in the offering is at least
$35,000,000 with a pre-money valuation of at least $150,000,000, or as
otherwise adjusted upon the affirmative vote or written consent in favor of
such conversion is given by the holders (acting together as a class) of at
least 66 2/3% of the shares of the Preferred Stock, voting together as a
single class on an as-if-converted basis, provided that the Common Stock
is eligible for trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market (or its successor in
interest) or is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (or its successor in
interest); or

(8)

(1) for Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred
Stock, Series C Stock, and Series D Preferred Stock, the date upon
which the affirmative vote or written consent in favor of such
conversion is given by the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the shares
of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C
Stock, and Series D Preferred Stock, at the time outstanding,
voting together as a single class, on an as-if converted basis; and

(2) for Series E Preferred Stock, the date upon which
the affirmative vote or written consent in favor of conversion of
the Preferred Stock has been approved by (x) the holders of at least
66 2/3% of the shares of the Preferred Stock, at the time
outstanding, voting together as a single class, on an as-if converted
basis, and (y) the holders of at least 60% of the shares of the
Series E Preferred Stock, at the time outstanding, voting separately
as a single class, on an as-if converted basis.

Each holder of a share of Preferred Stock so converted shall be
entitled to receive the full number of shares of Common Stock into which
such applicable share of Preferred Stock held by such holder could be
converted if such holder had exercised its optional conversion right at the
time of the closing of such public offering or the giving of such vote or
consent, as applicable. Upon such conversion, each holder of an
applicable share of Preferred Stock shal) immediately surrender such share
in exchange for appropriate stock certificates representing a share or
shares of Common Stock.

Gi) Optional Conversion of Preferred Stock. At any time after the date

of issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C
Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock or Series E Preferred Stock, at the
option of any holder thereof, the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred
Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock or Series E Preferred
Stock shall be convertible, at the office of the Corporation (or at such other office

15
or offices, if any, as the board of directors may designate), into fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock, at the conversion price (as determined
and adjusted from time to time in accordance with the provisions of subsection
(C)e)Giii) below), in effect at the time of conversion. To convert shares of the
Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock without payment, the holder thereof
shall surrender at the principal office of the Corporation the certificate or
certificates therefor, duly endorsed to the Corporation or in blank, and give
written notice to the Corporation at such office that such holder elects to convert
such shares. Shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have been converted
immediately prior to the close of business on the day of the surrender of such
shares for conversion as herein provided, and the person entitled to receive the
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all
purposes as the record holder of such shares of Common Stock at such time. As
promptly as practicable on or after the conversion date, the Corporation shall
issue and deliver or cause to be issued and delivered at such office a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such
conversion. If the conversion is in connection with a public offering, whether
under this subsection (C)(e)(ii) or subsection (C)(e)(i) above, the conversion may,
at the option of any holder tendering the applicable shares of Preferred Stock for
conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of
securities pursuant to such offering, in which event the person(s) entitled to
receive the Common Stock upon conversion of the applicable shares of Preferred
Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such shares until immediately prior
to the closing of such sale of securities.

(iii) Conversion Price and Adjustments. The number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of each share of the Series A Preferred
Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred, Series D Preferred Stock and
Series E Preferred Stock, whether optional or mandatory conversion, shall be
equal to: (a) $1.00, in the case of the Series A Preferred Stock, (b) $1.75, in the
case of the Series B Preferred Stock, (c) $3.170655, in the case of the Series C
Preferred Stock, (d) $1.00, in the case of the Series D Preferred Stock, and (e)
$1.00, in the case of the Series E Preferred Stock, divided by the conversion price
then in effect (the “Conversion Price”). As of the date of this Certificate of
Incorporation and prior to the issuance of Series E Preferred Stock, the
Conversion Price for each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be $1.00, the
Conversion Price for each share of Series B Preferred Stock shal] be $1.511726,
the Conversion Price for each share of Series C Preferred Stock shall be
$2.481042, and the Conversion Price for each share of Series D Preferred Stock
shall be $1.00. The Conversion Price for each share of Series E Preferred Stock
shall initially be $1.00. Each such applicable Conversion Price shall be subject to
adjustment from time to time as hereinafter provided:

(A) _ If, at any time or from time to time on or after the filing of
this Certificate of Incorporation, the Corporation shall issue or sell
Additional Shares of Common Stock (including Convertible Securities)
for an Effective Price less than the applicable Conversion Price in effect

16
for the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock, Series C
Preferred Stock, the Series D Preferred Stock or the Series E Preferred
Stock immediately prior to the time of such issue or sale, then, forthwith
upon such issue or sale, the applicable Conversion Price of the Series A
Preferred Stock, the Series-B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock,
the Series D Preferred Stock or the Series E Preferred Stock shall be
reduced to the price (calculated to the nearest cent) determined by dividing
(x) an amount equal to the sum of (1) number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale multiplied by the then
existing Conversion Price and (2) the consideration, if any, received by the
Corporation upon such issue or sale of the Additional Shares of Common
Stock, by (y) an amount equal to the sum of (1) the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale and (2)
the number of shares of Additional Shares of Common Stock thus issued
or sold. For purposes of this subsection (C)(e){iii)(A), the term Common
Stock shall include shares of Common Stock issuable without the payment
of any additional consideration or with payment of only nominal
consideration upon exercise, conversion or exchange of any securities of
the Corporation outstanding (including, but not limited to, the Series A
Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock, the Series C Preferred
Stock, Series D Preferred Stock and the Series E Preferred Stock).

(B) For the purposes of this subsection (C)(e)(jii), the term
“Additional Shares of Common Stock” shall mean all shares of Common
Stock issued by the Corporation after the filing of this Certificate of
Incorporation, other than (1) options to purchase up to 10,850,000 issued
and/or issuable shares (appropriately adjusted for any recapitalizations,
stock combinations, stock dividends, stock splits and the like, and as
adjusted by the board of directors of the Corporation pursuant to
subsection (C)(b)(vi)(J) above) of Common Stock granted to employees,
consultants or directors of the Corporation pursuant to any stock purchase
or stock option plan approved by the board of directors of the Corporation,
including the issuance of Common Stock upon exercise of such options,
(2) the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of Preferred
Stock, (3) shares of Common Stock (including warrants to purchase shares
of Common Stock or capital stock convertible into Common Stock) issued
or issuable to lending or leasing institutions in connection with the
Corporation’s debt, equipment leasing or other non-equity interim
financing approved by the board of directors of the Corporation, provided
that such shares of Common Stock so issued or issuable do not in the
aggregate exceed 3% of the fully-diluted capital stock of the Corporation,
(4) warrants to purchase an aggregate of 944,998 shares of Series E
Preferred Stock issued pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, dated
March 5, 2010, including the issuance of shares upon the exercise of such
warrants, and (5) such other issuances of shares of Common Stock as to
which the provisions of this subsection (C)(e)(iii) may be waived by the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the then outstanding

17
shares of the Preferred Stock, voting together as a class on an as-if
converted basis. For the purposes of this section (C), the term “Effective
Price” shall mean the price per share for Additional Shares of Common
Stock determined by dividing the total number of Additional Shares of
Common Stock issued or sold, or deemed to have been issued or sold by the
Corporation, into the aggregate consideration received, or deemed to have
been received by the Corporation for such issue or sale.

For the purposes of this subsection (C)(e)(iii) the following clauses
(1) to (4), inclusive, shall also be applicable:

(1) In case at any time the Corporation shall grant
(1) any rights to subscribe for or to purchase, or any options for the
purchase of, Additional Shares of Common Stock or (2) any
obligations or any shares of stock of the Corporation which are
convertible into, or exchangeable for, Additional Shares of
Common Stock (any of such obligations or shares of stock being
hereinafter referred to as “Convertible Securities”) whether or not
such rights or options or the right to convert or exchange any such
Convertible Securities are immediately exercisable, and the
Effective Price for which Additional Shares of Common Stock are
issuable upon the exercise of such rights or options or upon
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities (determined
by dividing (x) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by
the Corporation as consideration for the granting of such rights or
options, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional
consideration payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such
rights or options, plus, in the case of such rights or options which
relate to Convertible Securities, the minimum aggregate amount of
additional consideration, if any, payable upon the issue of such
Convertible Securities and upon the conversion or exchange
thereof, by (y) the total maximum number of shares of Additional
Shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such rights
or options or upon the conversion or exchange of all such
Convertible Securities issuable upon the exercise of such rights or
options) shall be less than the applicable Conversion Price with
respect to the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred
Stock, the Series C Preferred Stock, the Series D Preferred Stock
and/or the Series E Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to
the time of the granting of such rights or options, then the total
maximum number of Additional Shares of Common Stock issuable
upon the exercise of such rights or options or upon conversion or
exchange of the total maximum amount of such Convertible
Securities issuable upon the exercise of such rights or options shall
(as of the date of granting of such rights or options) be deemed to
have been issued for such price per share. Except as provided in
subsection (C)(e)(iii)(C) below, no further adjustments of the

18
Conversion Price with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock, the
Series B Preferred Stock, the Series C Preferred Stock, the Series
D Preferred Stock and/or the Series E Preferred Stock shall be
made upon the actual issue of such Additional Shares of Common
Stock or of such Convertible Securities upon exercise of such
rights or options or upon the actual issue of such Additional Shares
of Common Stock upon conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities.

(2) Incase the Corporation shall issue or sell (whether
directly or by assumption in a merger or otherwise) any
Convertible Securities, whether or not the rights to exchange or
convert thereunder are immediately exercisable, and the Effective
Price for which Additional Shares of Common Stock are issuable
upon such conversion or exchange (determined by dividing (x) the
total amount of consideration received or receivable by the
Corporation for the issuance or sale of such Convertible Securities,
plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if
any, payable to the Corporation upon the conversion or exchange
thereof, by (y) the total maximum number of shares of Additional
Shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion or
exchange of all such Convertible Securities) shall be less than the
applicable Conversion Price with respect to the Series A Preferred
Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock, the Series C Preferred Stock,
the Series D Preferred Stock or the Series E Preferred Stock in
effect immediately prior to the time of such issue or sale, then the
total maximum number of shares of Additional Shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion or exchange of all such
Convertible Securities shall (as of the date of the issue or sale of
such Convertible Securities) be deemed to be outstanding and to
have been issued for such price per share, provided that (x) except
as provided in subsection (C)(e)(iii)(C) below, no further
adjustments of the conversion price shall be made upon the actual
issue of such Common Stock upon conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities, and (y) if any such issue or sale of such
Convertible Securities is made upon exercise of any rights to
subscribe for or to purchase or any option to purchase any such
Convertible Securities for which adjustments of a Conversion Price
has been or are to be made pursuant to other provisions of this
clause (2), no further adjustment of such Conversion Price shall be
made by reason of such issue or sale.

(3) In case any Additional Shares of Common Stock or
Convertible Securities or any rights or options to purchase any
such Additional Shares of Common Stock or Convertible
Securities shall be issued or sold for cash, the consideration
received therefor shall be deemed to be the amount received by the

19
Corporation therefor, without deducting therefrom any expenses
incurred or any underwriting commissions, discounts or
concessions paid or allowed by the Corporation in connection
therewith. In case any Additional Shares of Common Stock or
Convertible Securities or any rights or options to purchase any
Additional Shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities
shall be issued or sold for a consideration other than cash, the
amount of the consideration other than cash received by the
Corporation shall be deemed to be the fair value of such
consideration as determined by the board of directors of the
Corporation, without deducting therefrom any expenses incurred or
any underwriting commissions, discounts or concessions paid or
allowed by the Corporation in connection therewith. In case any
Additional Shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities or
any rights or options to purchase such Additional Shares of
Common Stock or Convertible Securities shall be issued in
connection with any merger or consolidation in which the
Corporation is the surviving corporation, the amount of
consideration therefor shall be deemed to be the fair value as
determined by the board of directors of the Corporation of such
portion of the assets and business of the non-surviving corporation
or corporations as the board of directors of the Corporation shall
determine to be attributable to such Additional Shares of Common
Stock, Convertible Securities or rights or options therefor, as the
case may be.

(4) If(x) the Effective Price provided for in any right or
option referred to in clause (1) of this subsection (C)(e)(iii), or
(y) the additional consideration, if any, payable upon the
conversion or exchange of Convertible Securities referred to in
clause (1) or clause (2) of this subsection (C)(e)(iii), or (z) the rate
at which any Convertible Securities referred to in clause (1) or
clause (2) of this subsection (C)(e)(iii) are convertible into or
exchangeable for Additional Shares of Common Stock, shall
change at any time (other than under or by reason of provisions
designed to protect against dilution), the Conversion Price then in
effect hereunder shall forthwith be increased or decreased to such
Conversion Price as would have obtained had the adjustments
made upon the issuance of such rights, options or Convertible
Securities been made upon the basis of (a) the issuance of the
number of Additional Shares of Common Stock theretofore
actually delivered upon the exercise of such options or rights or
upon the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities,
and the total consideration received therefor, and (b) the issuance
at the time of such change of any such options, rights, or
Convertible Securities then still outstanding for the consideration,
if any, received by the Corporation therefor and to be received on

20
the basis of such changed price; and on the expiration of any such
option or right or the termination of any such right to convert or
exchange such Convertible Securities, the Conversion Price then in
effect hereunder shall forthwith be increased to such Conversion
Price as would have obtained had the adjustments made upon the
issuance of such rights or options or Convertible Securities been
made upon the basis of the issuance of the Additional Shares of
Common Stock theretofore actually delivered (and the ‘total
consideration received therefor) upon the exercise of such rights or
options or upon the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities. If the purchase price provided for in any right or option
referred to in clause (1) of this subsection (C)(eXiii), or the rate at
which any Convertible Securities referred to in clause (1) of this
subsection (C)(e)(iii) are convertible into or exchangeable for
Additional Shares of Common Stock, shal] decrease at any time
under or by reason of provisions with respect thereto designed to
protect against dilution, then in case of the delivery of the
Additional Shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of any such
right or option or upon conversion or exchange of any such
Convertible Security, the Conversion Price then in effect hereunder
shall forthwith be decreased to such Conversion Price as would
have obtained had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such
tight, option or Convertible Security been made upon the basis of
the issuance of (and the total consideration received for) the
Additional Shares of Common Stock delivered as aforesaid.

(C) In case the Corporation shall at any time subdivide its

outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, the
applicable Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series B
Preferred Stock, the Series C Preferred Stock, the Series D Preferred Stock
and the Series E Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such
subdivision shall be proportionately reduced, and conversely, in case the
outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined into a smaller
number of shares, the Conversion Prices in effect immediately prior to
such combination shall be proportionately increased.

Dividends or Distributions. In case the Corporation shall

(x) declare a dividend upon the Common Stock payable in Common Stock (other
than a dividend declared to effect a subdivision or combination of the outstanding
shares of Common Stock, as described in subsection (C)(e)(iii)(C) above) or
Convertible Securities, or in any rights or options to purchase Common Stock or
Convertible Securities, or (y) declare any other dividend or make any other
distribution upon the Common Stock payable otherwise than out of earnings or
earned surplus, then thereafter each holder of the Preferred Stock upon the
conversion thereof will be entitled to receive the number of shares of Common
Stock into which such series of Preferred Stock have been converted, and, in
addition and without payment therefor, each dividend described in clause (x)

21
above and each dividend or distribution described in clause (y) above which such
holder would have received by way of dividends or distributions, if continuously
since such holder became the record holder of such Preferred Stock, such holder
(a) had been the record holder of the number of shares of Common Stock then
received, and (b) had retained all dividends or distributions in stock or securities
(including Common Stock or Convertible Securities, and any rights or options to
purchase any Common Stock or Convertible Securities) payable in respect of such
Common Stock or in respect of any stock or securities paid as dividends or
distributions and originating directly or indirectly from such Common Stock. For
the purposes of the foregoing, a dividend or distribution other than in cash shall
be considered payable out of earnings or earned surplus only to the extent that
such earnings or earned surplus are charged an amount equal to the fair value of
such dividend or distribution as determined by the board of directors of the
Corporation.

(v) Reorganization or Reclassification. If any capital reorganization or
reclassification of the capital stock of the Corporation shall be effected in such a
way that holders of the Common Stock shall be entitled to receive stock,
securities or assets with respect to or in exchange for the Common Stock, then, as
a condition of such reorganization or reclassification, lawful and adequate
provisions shal] be made whereby each holder of the Preferred Stock shall
thereupon have the right to receive, upon the basis and upon the terms and
conditions specified herein and in lieu of the shares of Common Stock
immediately theretofore receivable upon the conversion of shares of the Preferred
Stock, such shares of stock, securities or assets as may be issued or payable with
respect to or in exchange for a number of outstanding shares of such Common
Stock equal to the number of shares of such Common Stock immediately
theretofore receivable upon such conversion had such reorganization or
reclassification not taken place, and in any such case appropriate provisions shall
be made with respect to the rights and interests of such holder to the end that the
provisions hereof (including, without limitation, provisions for adjustments of the
Conversion Price) shal] thereafter be applicable, as nearly as may be, in relation to
any shares of stock, securities or assets thereafter deliverable upon the exercise of
such conversion rights,

(vi) Corrective Actions. If any event occurs as to which in the opinion
of the board of directors of the Corporation the other provisions of
subsection (C)(e)(iii) are not strictly applicable or if strictly applicable would not
fairly protect the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock in accordance with
the essential intent and principles of such provisions, then the board of directors
of the Corporation shall make an adjustment in the application of such provisions,
in accordance with such essential intent and principles, so as to protect such rights
as aforesaid.

(vii) Notice of Conversion Price Adjustment. In each case of an
adjustment of the Conversion Price with respect to any series of the Preferred

Stock, the Corporation shall give written notice thereof, by first-class mail,

22
postage prepaid, addressed to the registered holders of the applicable Preferred
Stock, at the addresses of such holders as shown on the books of the Corporation,
which notice shall state the Conversion Price resulting from such adjustment and
the increase or decrease, if any, in the number of shares receivable at such price
upon the conversion of the applicable Preferred Stock, setting forth in reasonable
detail the method of calculation and the facts upon which such calculation is
based.

(viii) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be
issued upon conversion, but, instead of any fraction of a share which would
otherwise be issuable, the Corporation shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of
such fraction in an amount equal to the same fraction of the market price per share
of Common Stock as of the close of business on the day of conversion. “Market
Price” shall mean if the Common Stock is traded on a securities exchange, the
closing price of the Common Stock on such exchange, or, if the Common Stock is
otherwise traded in the over-the-counter market, the closing bid price, in each
case averaged over a period of 20 consecutive business days immediately prior to
the date as of which “market price” is being determined. If at any time the
Common Stock is not traded on an exchange or otherwise traded in the over-the-
counter market, the “market price” shall be deemed to be the higher of (x) the
book value thereof as determined by any firm of independent public accountants
of recognized standing selected by the board of directors of the Corporation as of
the last day of any month ending within 60 days preceding the date as of which
the determination is to be made, or (y) the fair value thereof determined in good
faith by the board of directors of the Corporation as of a date which is within 15
days of the date as of which the determination is to be made.

(ix) No Impairment. The Corporation will not, by amendment of its
certificate of incorporation or through any reorganization, recapitalization,
transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or
any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance
of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Corporation, but
will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this
subsection (C)(e) and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or
appropriate in order to protect the holders of the Preferred Stock against
impairment.

(x) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation
shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued

shares of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of
any outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect
the exercise of all such Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate
action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized
but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be
sufficient for such purposes, including, without limitation, using its best efforts to

23
obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to the
Corporation’s certificate of incorporation

(xi) | Effect of Conversion. All shares of the Preferred Stock that have
been surrendered for conversion as herein provided shal! no Jonger be deemed to
be outstanding and al] rights with respect to such shares shall immediately cease
and terminate at the time so converted, except only the right of the holders thereof
to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor, to receive payment in
lieu of any fraction of a share otherwise issuable upon such conversion as
provided in subsection (C)(e){viii) of this Article 5 and to receive payment of any
dividends declared but unpaid thereon. Any shares of the Preferred Stock so
converted shall be retired and cancelled and may not be reissued as shares of the
applicable series of the Preferred Stock, and the Corporation may thereafter take
such appropriate action (without the need for stockholder action) as may be
necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of the applicable series of the
Preferred Stock accordingly.

(f) Notices of Record Date. In the event of any taking by the Corporation of a
record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders
thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend) or other
distribution, any capital reorganization of the Corporation, any reclassification or
recapitalization of the Corporation’s capital stock, any consolidation or merger with or
into another corporation, any transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Corporation, any dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Corporation or any right to
subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of stock of any class or any other
securities or property, or to receive any other right, the Corporation shall mail to each
holder of the Preferred Stock, at least 10 business days prior to the date specified therein,
a notice specifying the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of
such dividend, distribution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend,
distribution or right. Any notice required by the provisions of this Article 5 to be given to
the holders of shares of the Preferred Stock shall be made in accordance with the Series E
Convertible Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement among the Corporation and the holders
of the Series E Preferred Stock.
