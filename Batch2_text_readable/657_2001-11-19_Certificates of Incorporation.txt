- The undersigned Michael Topolovac and Eric Larkin hereby certify that:

ONE: They are the duly elected and acting President and Secretary, respectively,
of said corporation.

TWO: The Articles of Incorporation of said corporation shal] be amended and
restated to read in full as follows:

ARTICLE I
The name of this corporation is OpenSpec, Inc.
ARTICLE II

The purpose of this corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which
a corporation may be organized under the General Corporation Law of California other than the
banking business, the trust company business or the practice of a profession permitted to be
incorporated by the California Corporations Code.

ARTICLE I

A. Classes of Stock. This corporation is authorized to issue two classes of
stock to be designated, respectively, “Common Stock” and “Preferred Stock.” The total number
of shares which this corporation is authorized to issue is 53,000,000 shares. 33,816,517 shares
shall be Common Stock, and 19,183,483 shares shall be Preferred Stock, 829,545 of which shall
be designated Series A Preferred Stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”), 4,794,616 of which
shall be designated Series B Preferred Stock (“Series B Preferred Stock”), and 13,559,322 of
which shall be designed Series C Preferred Stock (“Series C Preferred Stock”). The Series A
Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock, and the Series C Preferred Stock are hereinafter
collectively referred to as the “Preferred Stock.”

B. Rights, Preferences and Restrictions of Preferred Stock. The rights,

preferences, restrictions and other matters relating to the Preferred Stock are as follows:

1. Dividend Provisions. (a) The holders of shares of Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to receive, on an equal priority, pari passu basis, dividends, out of any assets legally
available therefor, in the amount of $0.0352 per share per annum with respect to the Series A
Preferred Stock, $0.073 per share per annum with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock, and
$.0472 per share per annum with respect to the Series C Preferred Stock, payable when, as and if
declared by the Board of Directors. Such dividends shall not be cumulative. So long as any
shares of Preferred Stock shall be outstanding, no dividend, whether in cash or property, shall be
paid or declared (payable other than in Common Stock or other securities and rights convertible
into or entitling the holder thereof to receive, directly or indirectly, additional shares of Common

{00046726v4}
Stock of this corporation), nor shall any other distribution be made, on the Common Stock, nor
shall any shares of Common Stock of the Company be purchased, redeemed, or otherwise
acquired for value by the Company (except for acquisitions of Common Stock by the Company
pursuant to agreements which permit the Company to repurchase such shares, at the original
purchase price for such shares, upon termination of services to the Company or in exercise of the
Company’s right of first refusal upon a proposed transfer) unti] all then declared but unpaid
dividends on the Preferred Stock shall have been paid or set apart. In the event that dividends are
paid on any share of Common Stock, an additional dividend shall be paid with respect to all —
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock in an amount equal per share (on an as-converted basis) to
the amount paid or set aside for each share of Common Stock.

(b) Non-Cash Dividends. Whether a dividend provided for in this
Section 2 shall be payable in property other than cash, the value of such dividend shall be
deemed to be the fair market value of such property as determined in good faith by the Board.

2. Liquidation Preference.

(a) _In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of this
corporation, either voluntary or involuntary, the holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
receive, prior and in preference to any distribution of any of the assets of this corporation to the
holders of Common Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount per share equal to the
sum of (i) $0.44 for each outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock as adjusted for any stock
dividends, combinations or splits with respect to such shares, (ii) $0.73 for each outstanding
share of Series B Preferred Stock as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations or splits with
respect to such shares, and (iii) $0.59 for each outstanding share of Series C Preferred Stock as
adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations or splits with respect to such shares (the
“Original Issue Price,” respectively for each series of Preferred Stock), plus (iii) any declared but
unpaid dividends on such share. If upon the occurrence of such event, the assets and funds thus
distributed among the holders of the Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit the payment
to such holders of the full aforesaid preferential amounts, then, the entire assets and funds of this
corporation legally available for distribution shall be distributed first, ratably among the holders
of the Series C Preferred Stock in proportion to the total preferential amount to which each such
holder is entitled, and second, ratably among the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and
Series B Preferred Stock in proportion to the total preferential amount to which each such holder
is entitled.

(6) Upon the completion of the distribution required by subparagraph
(a) of this Section 2, all of the remaining assets of this corporation available for distribution to
shareholders shall be distributed ratably among the holders of Common Stock in proportion to
the number of shares of Common Stock owned by each such holder.

(fc) Gi) For purposes of this Section 2, a liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of this corporation shall be deemed to be occasioned by, or to include, (A) the
acquisition of this corporation by another entity by means of any transaction or series of related
transactions (including, without limitation, any reorganization, merger or consolidation but,
excluding any merger effected exclusively for the purpose of changing the domicile of this
corporation) that results in the transfer of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding voting

{00046726v4) 2
power of this corporation; or (B) a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets
of this corporation.

(ii) In any of such events, if the consideration received by this
corporation is other than cash, its value will be deemed its fair market value as determined in
good faith by this corporation’s Board of Directors, except that any securities to be distributed to
the shareholders shall be valued as follows:

(A) Securities not subject to investment letter or other
similar restrictions on free marketability covered by (B) below:

(1) If traded on a securities exchange or through
the Nasdaq National Market, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing sale
prices of the securities on such quotation system over the thirty (30) day period ending three (3)
days prior to the closing;

(2}  Ifactively traded over-the-counter, the value
shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over
the thirty (30) day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing; and

(3) ‘If there is no active public market, the value
shall be the fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by this corporation and the holders
of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock.

(B) The method of valuation of securities subject to
investment letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely
by virtue of a shareholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an’
appropriate discount from the market value determined as above in (A) (1), (2) or (3) to reflect
the approximate fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by this corporation and the
holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of such Preferred
Stock.

(iii) This corporation shall give each holder of record of
Preferred Stock written notice of such impending transaction not later than twenty (20) days prior
to the shareholders’ meeting called to approve such transaction, or twenty (20) days prior to the
closing of such transaction, whichever is earlier, and shall also notify such holders in writing of
the final approval of such transaction. The first of such notices shall describe the material terms
and conditions of the impending transaction and the provisions of this Section 2, and this
corporation shall thereafter give such holders prompt notice of any material changes. The
transaction shall in no event take place sooner than twenty (20) days after this corporation has
given the first notice provided for herein or sconer than ten (10) days after this corporation has
given notice of any material changes provided for herein; provided, however, that such periods
may be shortened upon the written consent of the holders of Preferred Stock that are entitled to
such notice rights or similar notice rights and that represent at least a majority of the voting
power of all then outstanding shares of such Preferred Stock.

{00046726v4} 3
3. Redemption. The Preferred Stock is not redeemable.

4. Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion
rights as follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be
convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such
share, at the office of this corporation or any transfer agent for such stock, into such number of
fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Original
Issue Price of the applicable series of Preferred Stock by the Conversion Price applicable to such
share, determined as hereafter provided, in effect on the date the certificate is surrendered for
conversion. The initial Conversion Price per share for shares of Preferred Stock shall be the
Original Issue Price of the applicable series of Preferred Stock; provided, however, that the
Conversion Price for the Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in subsection
4(d).

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall
automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Price at the time in
effect for such series of Preferred Stock immediately upon the earlier of (i) except as provided
below in subsection 4(c), this corporation’s sale of its Common Stock in a firm commitment
underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities
Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”), as amended, the public offering price of which equals or
exceeds $5.00 per share (adjusted to reflect subsequent stock dividends, stock splits or
recapitalization), with aggregate gross proceeds to this corporation of at least $10,000,000, or
(ii) the date specified by written consent or.approval of the holders of two-thirds of the then
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion, Before any holder of Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock, the holder shall surrender the
certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of this corporation or of any
transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to this corporation at its
principal corporate office, of the election to convert the same and shall state therein the name or
names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued. This
corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder
of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for
the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid. Such
conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the
date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons
entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated
for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock as of such date.
If the conversion is in connection with an underwritten offering of securities registered pursuant
to the Securities Act, the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering Preferred Stock
for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of securities
pursuant to such offering, in which event the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock
upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred
Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities.

(000467264) 4
(d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock for Certain
Dilutive Issuances, Splits and Combinations. The Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock shall

be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

(i) (A) If this corporation shall issue or be deemed pursuant
to the terms hereof to have issued, after the date upon which any shares of Series A Preferred
Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, as the case may be, were first issued (the “Purchase Date”
with respect to each such series), any Additional Stock (as defined below) without consideration
or for a consideration per share less than the Conversion Price for such series in effect
immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock, the Conversion Price for such series
in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall forthwith (except as otherwise provided in
this clause (i)) be adjusted to a price determined by multiplying the Conversion Price by a
fraction, (1) the numerator of which shall be equal to the total computed under clause (x) below
and (2) the denominator of which shall be equal to the total computed under clause (y) below:

(x) an amount equal to the sum of (a) the number of shares of Outstanding
Common Stock (as such term is defined below) outstanding immediately
prior to such issue or sale, plus (b) the number of shares of Outstanding
Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received (or deemed
received) by this corporation for the total number of Additional Stock so
issued (or deemed issued) would purchase at such Conversion Price, and

(y) an amount equal to the sum of (a) the number of shares of Outstanding
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale plus
(b) the number of such Additional Stock so issued (or deemed issued).

As used herein, the term “Outstanding Common Stock” means all shares of Common Stock that
are outstanding plus all shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of Preferred Stock, or
the exercise of any outstanding options or warrants.

(B) _ If this corporation shall issue or be deemed pursuant
to the terms hereof to have issued, after the date upon which any shares of Series C Preferred
Stock, as the case may be, were first issued (the “Purchase Date” with respect to each such
series), any Additional Stock (as defined below) without consideration or for a consideration per
share less than the Conversion Price for such series in effect immediately prior to the issuance
of such Additional Stock, the Conversion Price for such series in effect immediately prior to
each such issuance shall (except as otherwise provided in this clause (i)) be adjusted, as of the
opening of business on the date of such issue or sale, to a price determined as follows:

(1) _ in the event this corporation raises less than
$2,500,000 in its next equity financing following the sale of its Series C Preferred Stock, then the
Conversion Price shall be adjusted to a price determined by multiplying the Conversion Price by
a fraction, (1) the numerator of which shall be equal to the total computed under clause (x) below
and (2) the denominator of which shall be equal to the total computed under clause (y) below:

(x) an amount equal to the sum of (a) the number of shares of Outstanding
Stock (as such term is defined below) outstanding immediately prior to

{00046726v4} 5
such issue or sale, plus (b) the number of shares of Outstanding Stock that
the aggregate consideration received (or deemed received) by this
corporation for the total number of Additional Stock so issued (or deemed
issued) would purchase at such Conversion Price, and

(y) | an amount equal to the sum of (a) the number of shares of Outstanding
Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale plus (b) the
number of such Additional Stock so issued (or deemed issued).

(2) in all other instances, to equal the Effective
Price (as defined below) of such issue or sale.

As used herein, the term “Outstanding Stock” means all shares of Common Stock that are
issuable upon conversion of Preferred Stock. The “Effective Price” shall mean the quotient
determined by dividing the total number of Additional Stock issued or sold, or deemed to have
been issued or sold by the Company under this Section 4(d)(i)(B), into the aggregate
consideration received, or deemed to have been received by the Company for such issue under
this Section 4(d)(i)(B), for such Additional Stock

(C) No adjustment of the Conversion Price for the
Preferred Stock shall be made in an amount less than one cent per share, provided that any
adjustments which are not required to be made by reason of this sentence shall be carried forward
and shall be either taken into account in any subsequent adjustment made prior to three years
from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward, or shall be made at
the end of three years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried
forward. Except to the limited extent provided for in subsections (F)(3) and (F)(4), no
adjustment of such Conversion Price pursuant to this subsection 4(d)(i) shall have the effect of
increasing the Conversion Price above the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such
adjustment; provided, however, that in no case shall the Conversion Price ever exceed the
Original Issue Price except pursuant to the provisions of subsection 4(d)(iv) hereof.

(D) In the case of the issuance of Common Stock for
cash, the consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting
any reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by this
corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

(2) In the case of the issuance of the Common Stock for
a consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be
deemed to be the fair value thereof as determined by the Board of Directors irrespective of any
accounting treatment.

(F) In the case of the issuance (whether before, on or
after the Purchase Date) of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common Stock,
securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock or options to
purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or exchangeable securities, the following
provisions shall apply for all purposes of this subsection 4(d){i) and subsection 4(d)(ii):

{00046726v4} 6
(1) The aggregate maximum number of shares
of Common Stock deliverable upon exercise (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to
exercisability, including without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account
potential antidilution adjustments) of such options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common
Stock shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such options or rights were issued and for
a consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in
subsections 4(d)(i)(D) and (d)(i)(E)), if any, received by this corporation upon the issuance of
such options or rights plus the minimum exercise price provided in such options or rights
(without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) for the Common Stock covered
thereby.

(2) The aggregate maximum number of shares
of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of or in exchange (assuming the satisfaction of
any conditions to convertibility or exchangeability, including, without limitation, the passage of
time, but without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) for any such convertible
or exchangeable securities or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for
such convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof shail
be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or such options or rights
were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration, if any, received by this
corporation for any such securities and related options or rights (excluding any cash received on
account of accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the minimum additional consideration, if
any, to be received by this corporation (without taking into account potential antidilution
adjustments) upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or the exercise of any related
options or rights (the consideration in each case to be determined in the manner provided in

subsections 4(d)(i)(D) and (d)(i)(E)).

(3) __ In the event of any change in the number of
shares of Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to this corporation upon
exercise of such options or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such convertible or
exchangeable securities, including, but not limited to, a change resulting from the antidilution
provisions thereof, the Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected
by or computed using such options, rights or securities, shall be recomputed to reflect such
change, but no further adjustment shall be made for the actual issuance of Common Stock or any
payment of such consideration upon the exercise of any such options or rights or the conversion
or exchange of such securities.

(4) Upon the expiration of any such options or
rights, the termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options
or rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Conversion Price of the
Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, rights or
securities or options or rights related to such securities, shall be recomputed to reflect the
issuance of only the number of shares of Common Stock (and convertible or exchangeable
securities which remain in effect) actually issued upon the exercise of such options or rights,
upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or upon the exercise of the options or rights
related to such securities.

{00046726v4} 7
(5) The number of shares of Common Stock
deemed issued and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to subsections 4(d)(i)(F)(1)
and (2) shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or expiration of the type
described in either subsection 4(d)(i)(F)(3) or (4).

(ii) “Additional Stock” shall mean any shares of Common
Stock issued (or deemed to have been issued pursuant to subsection 4(d)(i)(F)) by this
corporation after the Purchase Date other than:

(A) | shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to a
transaction described in subsection 4(d)(iii) hereof;

(B) shares of Common Stock and/or options therefore
issued or issuable to employees, officers, directors, consultants or advisors of this corporation
directly or pursuant to a stock option plan or restricted stock plan or other arrangement approved
by the Board of Directors of this corporation;

(C) shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of
shares of Preferred Stock; or

(D) _ shares of stock and/or warrants therefore issued to
leasing companies, landlords, lenders and other providers of goods or services to the Company,
provided such issuances are for other than primarily equity financing purposes and that the
issuance of such securities is approved by this corporation’s Board of Directors; or issued to
parties providing this corporation with equipment leases, real property leases, loans, credit lines
or guarantees of indebtedness; provided, the issuance of such warrants is approved by this
corporation’s Board of Directors. ,

(iii) In the event this corporation should at any time or from
time to time after the Purchase Date fix a record date for the effectuation of a split or subdivision
of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or the determination of holders of Common Stock
entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock
or other securities or rights convertible into, or entitling the holder thereof to receive directly or
indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock (hereinafter referred to as “Common Stock
Equivalents”) without payment of any consideration by such holder for the additional shares of
Common Stock or the Common Stock Equivalents (including the additional shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof), then, as of such record date (or the date of
such dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no record date is fixed), the Conversion Price of
the Preferred Stock shall be appropriately decreased so that the number of shares of Common
Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be increased in proportion to such
increase of the aggregate of shares of Common Stock outstanding and those issuable with respect
to such Common Stock Equivalents.

(iv) If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at
any time after the Purchase Date is decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock, then, following the record date of such combination, the Conversion Price for
the Preferred Stock shall be appropriately increased so that the number of shares of Common

{00046726v4) 8
Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be decreased in proportion to such
decrease in outstanding shares,

(ec) Other Distributions. In the event this corporation shall declare a
distribution payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by this
corporation or other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred to
in subsection 4(d)(iii), then, in each such case for the purpose of this subsection 4(e), the holders
of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any such distribution as though
they were the holders of the number of shares of Common Stock of this corporation into which
their shares of Preferred Stock are convertible as of the record date fixed for the determination of
the holders of Common Stock of this corporation entitled to receive such distribution.

(f) Recapitalizations. If at any time or from time to time there shail be
a recapitalization of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision, combination or merger or sale
of assets transaction provided for elsewhere in this Section 4 or Section 2) provision shall be
made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon
conversion of the Preferred Stock the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of
the Company or otherwise, to which a holder of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion
would have been entitled on such recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall
be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 4 with respect to the rights of the
holders of the Preferred Stock after the recapitalization to the end that the provisions of this
Section 4 (including adjustment of the Conversion Price then in effect and the number of shares
purchasable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event as nearly
equivalent as may be practicable.

(g) No Impairment. Without the consent of the holders of Preferred
Stock as specified in Section 6, this corporation will not, by amendment of its Amended and
Restated Articles of Incorporation or through any reorganization, recapitalization, transfer of
assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary
action, avoid or seck to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed
or performed hereunder by this corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in the
carrying out of all the provisions of this Section 4 and in the taking of all such action as may be
necessary or appropriate in order to protect the Conversion Rights of the holders of the Preferred
Stock against impairment.

(h) No Fractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments.

(i) No fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of
any share or shares of the Preferred Stock, and the number of shares of Common Stock to be
issued shall be rounded to the nearest whole share. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the
holder would otherwise be entitled, this corporation shall pay cash equal to the product of such
fraction multiplied by the Common Stock’s fair market value as determined in good faith by this
corporation’s Board of Directors as of the date of conversion. Whether or not fractional shares
are issuable upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of shares
of Preferred Stock the holder is at the time converting into Common Stock and the number of
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such aggregate conversion.

{00046726v4) 9
(ii) | Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of
the Conversion Price of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4, this corporation, at its
expense, shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms
hereof and prepare and furnish to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such
adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or
readjustment is based. This corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder
of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth
(A) such adjustment and readjustment, (B) the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred
Stock at the time in effect, and (C) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if
any, of other property which at the time would be received upon the conversion of a share of
Preferred Stock.

}) Notices of Record Date. In the event of any taking by this
corporation of a record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the
holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend) or other
distribution, any right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of stock of any
class or any other securities or property, or to receive any other right, this corporation shall mail
to each holder of Preferred Stock, at least twenty (20) days prior to the date specified therein, a
notice specifying the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such
dividend, distribution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or
right.

(j) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. This corporation
shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common

Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock,
such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, in addition to such other remedies as shall
be available to the holder of such Preferred Stock, this corporation will take such corporate
action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes,
including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite shareholder approval
of any necessary amendment to these articles.

(k) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Section 4 to
be given to the holders of shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed given if deposited in the
United States mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to each holder of record at his address
appearing on the books of this corporation.

5, Voting Rights.

(a) General Voting Rights. The holder of each share of Preferred
Stock shall have the right to one vote for each share of Common Stock into which such Preferred
Stock could then be converted, and with respect to such vote, such holder shall have full voting
rights and powers equal to the voting rights and powers of the holders of Common Stock, and
shall be entitled, notwithstanding any provision hereof, to notice of any shareholders’ meeting in

{00046726v4) 10
accordance with the bylaws of this corporation, and shall be entitled to vote, together with
holders of Common Stock, with respect to any question upon which holders of Common Stock
have the right to vote. Fractional votes shall not, however, be permitted and any fractional
voting rights available on an as-converted basis (after aggregating all shares into which shares of
Preferred Stock held by each holder could be converted) shall be rounded to the nearest whole
number (with one-half being rounded upward).

(b) Voting for the Election of Directors. The directors of this corporation
shall be elected at this corporation’s annual meeting. The holders of a majority of shares of
Series C Preferred Stock shall be entitled to elect one director, voting as a separate class. The
holders of shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class, shall
elect all remaining directors.

6. Protective Provisions.

(a) So long as at least 250,000 shares of Preferred Stock are
outstanding (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations or splits with respect to such
shares), this corporation shall not without first obtaining the approval (by vote or written consent,
as provided by law) of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Preferred
Stock, voting as a single class:

(i) liquidate or dissolve this corporation;

(ii) | amend its Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation
or its By-laws to change the number of authorized directors of this corporation;

corporation is disposed of;

(iv) pay or declare any dividend, whether in cash or property,
on the Company’s Common Stock;

(v) redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire (or pay into or set
aside for a sinking fund for such purpose) any share or shares of Preferred Stock or Common

Common Stock from employees, officers, directors, consultants or other persons performing
services for the Company or any subsidiary pursuant to agreements under which the Company
has the option to repurchase such shares at cost or at cost upon the occurrence of certain events,
such as the termination of employment.

(b) So long as at least 250,000 shares of Preferred Stock are
outstanding (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations or splits with respect to such
shares), this corporation shall not without first obtaining the approval (by vote or written consent,
as provided by law) of two-thirds (2/3) of the Preferred Stock, voting together as a class:
