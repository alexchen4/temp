ARTICLE V

The rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to and imposed on the Series
A Preferred Stock and the Common Stock are as follows:

1. Definitions. For purposes of this Article V, the following definitions apply:
1.1 “Board” shall mean the Board of Directors of the Corporation.
1.2 “Corporation” shall mean this corporation.

1.3 “Common Stock” shall mean the Common Stock, $0.00001 par value, of
the Corporation.
1.4 “Common Stock Dividend” shall mean a stock dividend declared and paid
on the Common Stock that is payable solely in shares of Common Stock.

1.5 “Dividend Rate” shall mean eight percent (8%) of the Original Issue Price
per share per annum for the Series A Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock
dividends, recapitalizations or the like, with respect to such series of Preferred Stock).

1.6 “Original Issue Date” shall mean the date on which the first share of
Series A Preferred Stock is issued by the Corporation.

1.7 “Original Issue Price” shall mean $0.8209 per share for the Series A

with respect to such series of Preferred Stock).

1.8 “Permitted Repurchases” shall mean the repurchase by the Corporation
of shares of Common Stock held by employees, officers, directors, consultants, independent
contractors, advisors, or other persons performing services for the Corporation or a subsidiary
that are subject to restricted stock purchase agreements or stock option exercise agreements
under which the Corporation has the option to repurchase such shares: (i) at cost, upon the

that is approved by the Board.

2. Dividend Rights.

2.1 Series A Preferred Stock. In each calendar year, the holders of the then
outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if
declared by the Board, out of any funds and assets of the Corporation legally available therefor,
noncumulative dividends at the annual Dividend Rate for the Series A Preferred Stock, prior and
in preference to the payment of any dividends on the Common Stock in such calendar year (other
than a Common Stock Dividend). No dividends or other distributions (other than a Common
Stock Dividend) shall be paid, with respect to the Common Stock during any calendar year
unless dividends in the total amount of the annual Dividend Rate for the Series A Preferred Stock
shall have first been paid or declared and set apart for payment to the holders of the Series A
Preferred Stock during that calendar year. Permitted Repurchases shall not be deemed to be
dividends or other distributions on the Common Stock. Dividends on the Series A Preferred
Stock shall not be mandatory or cumulative, and no rights or interest shall accrue to the holders
of the Series A Preferred Stock by reason of the fact that the Corporation shall fail to declare or
pay dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock in the amount of the annual Dividend Rate for the
Series A Preferred Stock or in any other amount in any calendar year or any fiscal year of the
Corporation, whether or not the earnings of the Corporation in any calendar year or fiscal year

2
24223/00010/D0CS/1533370.4
were sufficient to pay such dividends in whole or in part.

2.2 ‘Participation Rights. If, after dividends in the full preferential amounts
specified in Section 2.1 for the Series A Preferred Stock have been paid or declared and set apart
in any calendar year of the Corporation, the Board shall declare additional dividends out of funds
or assets legally available therefor in that calendar year, then such additional dividends shall be
declared pro rata on the Common Stock and the Series A Preferred Stock on a pari passu basis
according to the number of shares of Common Stock held by such holders, where each holder of
shares of the Series A Preferred Stock is to be treated for this purpose as holding the greatest
whole number of shares of Common Stock then issuable upon conversion of all shares of the
Series A Preferred Stock held by such holder pursuant to Section 6.

2.3. Non-Cash Dividends. Whenever a dividend provided for in this Section 2
shall be payable in property other than cash, the value of such dividend shall be deemed to be the
fair market value of such property as determined in good faith by the Board (including the
consent of at least one of the Preferred Directors).

3. Liquidation Rights. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of
the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, the funds and assets that may be legally
distributed to the Corporation’s stockholders (the “Available Funds and Assets”) shall be
distributed to stockholders in the following manner:

3.1 Series A Preferred Stock. The holders of each share of Series A Preferred
Stock then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid, out of the Available Funds and Assets, and
prior and in preference to any payment or distribution (or any setting apart of any payment or
distribution) of any Available Funds and Assets on any shares of Common Stock, an amount per
share equal to the Original Issue Price plus all declared but unpaid dividends on the Series A
Preferred Stock. If upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the
Available Funds and Assets shall be insufficient to permit the payment to holders of the Series A
Preferred Stock of their full preferential amount described in this Section, then the entire
Available Funds and Assets shall be distributed among the holders of the then outstanding Series
A Preferred Stock pro rata, according to the number of outstanding shares of Series A Preferred
Stock held by each holder thereof.

3.2 | Remaining Assets. If there are any Available Funds and Assets remaining
after the payment or distribution (or the setting aside for payment or distribution) to the holders
of the Series A Preferred Stock of their full preferential amounts described above in Section 3.1,
then all such remaining Available Funds and Assets shall be distributed solely among the holders
of the then outstanding Common Stock pro rata according to the number of shares of Common
Stock held by each holder thereof.

3.3. Merger or Sale of Assets. Unless otherwise approved by vote of the
holders of at least sixty percent (60%) of the outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock,
each of the following transactions (each, a “Change of Control’) shall be deemed to be a
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation as those terms are used in this Section
3: (a) any reorganization, consolidation, merger or similar transaction or series of related
transactions (each, a “combination transaction’) in which the Corporation is a constituent
corporation or is a party if, as a result of such combination transaction, the voting securities of
the Corporation that are outstanding immediately prior to the consummation of such combination

24223 /00010/DOCS/1533370.4
transaction (other than any such securities that are held by an “Acquiring Stockholder”, as
defined below) do not represent, or are not converted into, securities of the surviving corporation
of such combination transaction (or such surviving corporation's parent corporation if the
surviving corporation is owned by the parent corporation) that, immediately after the
consummation of such combination transaction, together represent at least a majority of the total
voting power of all securities of such surviving corporation (or its parent corporation, if
applicable) that are outstanding immediately after the consummation of such combination
transaction, including securities of such surviving corporation (or its parent corporation, if
applicable) that are held by the Acquiring Stockholder; or (b) a sale, exclusive license or other
conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation. For the avoidance of doubt,
the sale of equity securities of the Corporation for the purpose of raising additional working
capital shall not be deemed to be a Change of Control. For purposes of this Section 3.3, an
“Acquiring Stockholder” means a stockholder or stockholders of the Corporation that (i) merges
or combines with the Corporation in such combination transaction or (ii) owns or controls a
majority of another corporation that merges or combines with the Corporation in such
combination transaction.

3.4 Non-Cash Consideration. If any assets of the Corporation distributed to
stockholders in connection with any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation
are other than cash, then the value of such assets shall be their fair market value as determined by
the Board in good faith, except that any securities to be distributed to stockholders in a
liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation shall be valued as follows:

(a) The method of valuation of securities not subject to investment
letter or other similar restrictions on free marketability shall be as follows:

(i) unless otherwise specified in a definitive agreement for the
acquisition of the Corporation, if the securities are then traded on a national securities exchange
or the Nasdaq National Market (or a similar national quotation system), then the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange or system over
the thirty (30) day period ending three (3) days prior to the distribution; and

(ii) if () above does not apply but the securities are actively
traded over-the-counter, then, unless otherwise specified in a definitive agreement for the
acquisition of the Corporation, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid
prices over the thirty (30) calendar day period ending three (3) trading days prior to the
distribution; and

(iii) if there is no active public market as described in clauses (i)
or (ii) above, then the value shall be the fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by
the Board (including the consent of at least one of the Preferred Directors).

(b) The method of valuation of securities subject to investment letter
or other restrictions on free marketability shall be to make an appropriate discount from the
market value determined as above in subparagraphs (a)(i),(ii) or (iii) of this Section to reflect the
approximate fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board (including the
consent of at least one of the Preferred Directors).

4, Redemption. The Preferred Stock and the Common Stock are not redeemable at

24223/00010/D0CS/1533370.4
the option of the holder thereof.

5. Voting Rights.

5.1 Common Stock. Each holder of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled
to one (1) vote for each share thereof held.

5.2 Preferred Stock. Each holder of shares of Preferred Stock shall be entitled
to the number of votes equal to the number of whole shares of Common Stock into which such
shares of Preferred Stock could be converted pursuant to the provisions of Section 6 below at the
record date for the determination of the stockholders entitled to vote on such matters or, if no
such record date is established, the date such vote is taken or any written consent of stockholders
is solicited.

5.3 General. Subject to the other provisions of this Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, each holder of Preferred Stock shall have full voting rights and powers equal to
the voting rights and powers of the holders of Common Stock, and shall be entitled to notice of
any stockholders’ meeting in accordance with the bylaws of the Corporation (as in effect at the
time in question) and applicable law, and shall be entitled to vote, together with the holders of
Common Stock, with respect to any question upon which holders of Common Stock have the
right to vote, except as may be otherwise provided by applicable law. Except as otherwise
expressly provided herein or as required by law, the holders of Preferred Stock and the holders of
Common Stock shall vote together and not as separate classes.

5.4 Board of Directors Election and Removal.

(a) Election of Directors. The number of authorized directors on the
Board shall be five (5), who shall be elected as follows: (1) the holders of the Common Stock,
voting as a separate class, shall be entitled to elect two (2) directors of the Corporation; (11) so
long as at least 1,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding (such number of
shares being subject to proportional adjustments to reflect recapitalizations, combinations or
subdivisions of such series of Preferred Stock), the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock,
voting as a separate class, shall be entitled to elect two (2) directors of the Corporation (the
“Preferred Directors’), and (iii) the holders of the Preferred Stock and the Common Stock,
voting together as a single class on an as-converted basis shall be entitled to elect the remaining
director of the Corporation.

(b) uorum; Required Vote.

(i) Quorum. At any meeting of stockholders held for the
purpose of electing directors, the presence in person or by proxy (A) of the holders of a majority
of the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock or Common Stock then outstanding, respectively,
shall constitute a quorum for the election of directors to be elected solely by the holders of the
Series A Preferred Stock or Common Stock, respectively, and (B) of holders of a majority of the
voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Common Stock,
voting together as a single class on an as-converted basis, shall constitute a quorum for the
election of the directors to be elected jointly by the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and
the Common Stock.

(ii) Required Vote. With respect to the election of any director

5
24223/00010/D0CS/1533370.4
or directors by the holders of the outstanding shares of a specified series, class or classes of stock
given the right to elect such director or directors pursuant to Section 5.5(a) above (the “Specified
Stock’), that candidate or those candidates (as applicable) shall be elected who either: (4) in the
case of any such vote conducted at a meeting of the holders of such Specified Stock, receive the
highest number of affirmative votes (on an as-converted basis) of the outstanding shares of such
Specified Stock, up to the number of directors to be elected by such Specified Stock; or (ii) in the
case of any such vote taken by written consent without a meeting, are elected by the written
consent of the holders of a majority of outstanding shares of such Specified Stock.

(c) Vacancy. If there shall be any vacancy in the office of a director
elected or to be elected by the holders of any Specified Stock, then a director to hold office for
the unexpired term of such directorship may be elected by either: (i) by the affirmative vote of a
majority of the remaining director or directors (if any) in office that were so elected by the
holders of such Specified Stock, or (ii) by the required vote of holders of the shares of such
Specified Stock specified in Section 5.5(b)(ii) above that are entitled to elect such director.

(d) Removal. Any director who shall have been elected to the Board
by the holders of any Specified Stock, or by any director or directors elected by holders of any
Specified Stock as provided in Section 5.5(c), may be removed during his or her term of office,
without cause, by, and only by, the affirmative vote of shares representing a majority of the
voting power, on an as-converted basis, of all the outstanding shares of such Specified Stock
entitled to vote, given either at a meeting of such stockholders duly called for that purpose or
pursuant to a written consent of stockholders without a meeting, and any vacancy created by
such removal may be filled only in the manner provided in Section 5.5(c).

(e) Procedures. Any meeting of the holders of any Specified Stock,
and any action taken by the holders of any Specified Stock by written consent without a meeting,
in order to elect or remove a director under this Section 5.5, shall be held in accordance with the
procedures and provisions of the Corporation’s Bylaws, the Delaware General Corporation Law
and applicable law regarding stockholder meetings and stockholder actions by written consent,
as such are then in effect (including but not limited to procedures and provisions for determining
the record date for shares entitled to vote).

5.5 Vote by Ballot. Election of directors need not be by written ballot unless
the Bylaws of the Corporation shall so provide.

6. Conversion Rights. The outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be
convertible into Common Stock as follows:

6.1 Optional Conversion.

(a) At the option of the holder thereof, each share of Preferred Stock
shall be convertible, at any time or from time to time prior to the close of business on the
business day before any date fixed for redemption of such share, into fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock as provided herein.

(b) Each holder of Preferred Stock who elects to convert the same into
shares of Common Stock shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at
the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock or Common Stock, and

6
24223/00010/DO0CS/1533370.4
shall give written notice to the Corporation at such office that such holder elects to convert the
same and shall state therein the number of shares of Preferred Stock being converted. Thereupon
the Corporation shall promptly issue and deliver at such office to such holder a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled upon
such conversion. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the
close of business on the date of such surrender of the certificate or certificates representing the
shares of Preferred Stock to be converted (or the date the holder notifies the Corporation or its
transfer agent that such certificate or certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes
an agreement reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any
loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates), and the person entitled to receive the
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the
record holder of such shares of Common Stock on such date. If a conversion election under this
Section 6.1 is made in connection with an underwritten offering of the Corporation’s securities
pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (which underwritten offering does not cause
an automatic conversion pursuant to Section 6.2 to take place) the conversion may, at the option
of the holder tendering shares of Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing
with the underwriters of the sale of the Corporation’s securities pursuant to such offering, in
which event the holders making such elections who are entitled to receive Common Stock upon
conversion of their Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such shares of
Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of the Corporation’s securities
in the offering.

6.2 Automatic Conversion.

(a) Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into
fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock, as provided herein: (i) immediately prior
to the closing of a firm commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective
registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, covering the offer and
sale of Common Stock for the account of the Corporation in which the aggregate public offering
proceeds of the Corporation (before deduction of underwriters’ discounts and commissions)
exceed Thirty Million Dollars ($30,000,000) (a “Qualified Public Offering’) or (ii) upon the
Corporation’s receipt of the written consent of the holders of not less than sixty percent (60%) of
the then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, to the
conversion of all then outstanding Series A Preferred Stock under this Section 6.

(b) Upon the occurrence of any event specified in subparagraph 6.2(a)
(i) or (ii) above, the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted into Common Stock
automatically without the need for any further action by the holders of such shares and whether
or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer
agent; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates
evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion unless the certificates
evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are either delivered to the Corporation or its transfer
agent as provided below, or the holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such
certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement reasonably satisfactory
to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with
such certificates. Upon the occurrence of such automatic conversion of the Preferred Stock, the
holders of Preferred Stock shall surrender the certificates representing such shares at the office of
the Corporation or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock or Common Stock (or shall notify
the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and

24223/00010/DOCS/1533370.4
execute an agreement reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation
from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates). Thereupon, there shall be
issued and delivered to such holder promptly at such office and in its name as shown on such
surrendered certificate or certificates (or as set forth in the indemnity agreement), a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Preferred Stock
surrendered were convertible on the date on which such automatic conversion occurred.

6.3 Conversion Price. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be
convertible in accordance with Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 above into the number of shares of
Common Stock which results from dividing the Original Issue Price by the conversion price for
such series of Preferred Stock that is in effect at the time of conversion (the “Conversion
Price”). The initial Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred Stock shall be the Original Issue
Price. The Conversion Price of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from
time to time as provided below. Following each adjustment of the Conversion Price, such
adjusted Conversion Price shall remain in effect until a further adjustment of such Conversion
Price hereunder.

6.4 Adjustment Upon Common Stock Event. Upon the happening of a
Common Stock Event (as hereinafter defined), the Conversion Price of each such series of

Preferred Stock shall, simultaneously with the happening of such Common Stock Event, be
adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock in effect
immediately prior to such Common Stock Event by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which shall
be the number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to such
Common Stock Event, and (ii) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately after such Common Stock Event, and the
product so obtained shall thereafter be the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock.
The Conversion Price for a series of Preferred Stock shall be readjusted in the same manner upon
the happening of each subsequent Common Stock Event. As used herein, the term the
“Common Stock Event” shall mean at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue
Date, (i) the issue by the Corporation of additional shares of Common Stock as a dividend or
other distribution on outstanding Common Stock, (ii) a subdivision of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, or (iii) a combination of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock.

6.5 Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. If at any time or from

time to time after the Original Issue Date the Corporation pays a dividend or makes another
distribution to the holders of the Common Stock payable in securities of the Corporation, other
than an event constituting a Common Stock Event, then in each such event provision shall be
made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock shall receive upon conversion thereof, in addition
to the number of shares of Common Stock receivable upon conversion thereof, the amount of
securities of the Corporation which they would have received had their Preferred Stock been
converted into Common Stock on the date of such event (or such record date, as applicable) and
had they thereafter, during the period from the date of such event (or such record date, as
applicable) to and including the conversion date, retained such securities receivable by them as
aforesaid during such period, subject to all other adjustments called for during such period under
this Section 6 with respect to the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock or with respect to
such other securities by their terms.

6.6 Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. If at any

24223/00010/D0CS/1533370.4
time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date the Common Stock issuable upon the
conversion of the Preferred Stock is changed into the same or a different number of shares of any
class or classes of stock, whether by recapitalization, reclassification or otherwise (other than by
a Common Stock Event or a stock dividend, reorganization, merger, or consolidation provided
for elsewhere in this Section 6), then in any such event each holder of Preferred Stock shall have
the right thereafter to convert such stock into the kind and amount of stock and other securities
and property receivable upon such recapitalization, reclassification or other change by holders of
the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Preferred Stock could have
been converted immediately prior to such recapitalization, reclassification or change, all subject
to further adjustment as provided herein or with respect to such other securities or property by
the terms thereof.

6.7 Reorganizations, Mergers and Consolidations. If at any time or from time

to time after the Original Issue Date there is a reorganization of the Corporation (other than a
recapitalization, subdivision, combination, reclassification or exchange of shares provided for
elsewhere in this Section 6) or a merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into another
corporation (except an event which is governed under Section 3.3), then, as a part of such
reorganization, merger or consolidation, provision shall be made so that the holders of the
Preferred Stock thereafter shall be entitled to receive, upon conversion of the Preferred Stock, the
number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the Corporation, or of such successor
corporation resulting from such reorganization, merger or consolidation, to which a holder of
Common Stock deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled on such reorganization,
merger or consolidation. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the
application of the provisions of this Section 6 with respect to the rights of the holders of the
Preferred Stock after the reorganization, merger or consolidation to the end that the provisions of
this Section 6 (including adjustment of the Conversion Price then in effect and number of shares
issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event and be as
nearly equivalent to the provisions hereof as may be practicable. This Section 6.7 shall similarly
apply to successive reorganizations, mergers and consolidations. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Section 6, if any reorganization, merger or consolidation is
approved by the vote of stockholders required by Section 7 hereof, then such transaction and the
rights of the holders of Preferred Stock and Common Stock pursuant to such reorganization,
merger or consolidation will be governed by the documents entered into in connection with such
transaction and not by the provisions of this Section 6.7.

6.8 Sale of Shares Below Conversion Price.

(a) Adjustment Formula. If at any time or from time to time after the
Original Issue Date the Corporation issues or sells, or is deemed by the provisions of this
subsection 6.8 to have issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock (as hereinafter
defined), otherwise than in connection with a Common Stock Event as provided in subsection
6.4, a dividend or distribution as provided in subsection 6.5, a recapitalization, reclassification or
other change as provided in subsection 6.6, for an Effective Price (as hereinafter defined) that is
less than the Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to
such issue or sale (or deemed issue or sale), then, and in each such case, the Conversion Price for
such series of Preferred Stock shall be reduced, as of the close of business on the date of such
issue or sale, to the price obtained by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction:

24223/00010/D0CS/1533370.4
(i) The numerator of which shall be the sum of (A) the number
of Common Stock Equivalents Outstanding (as hereinafter defined) immediately prior to
such issue or sale of Additional Shares of Common Stock plus (B) the quotient obtained
by dividing the Aggregate Consideration Received (as hereinafter defined) by the
Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued or
sold (or deemed so issued and sold) by the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred
Stock in effect immediately prior to such issue or sale; and

(ii) The denominator of which shall be the sum of (A) the
number of Common Stock Equivalents Outstanding immediately prior to such issue or
sale plus (B) the number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued or sold (or
deemed so issued and sold).

(b) Certain Definitions. For the purpose of making any adjustment
required under this subsection 6.8:

{i} The “Additional Shares of Common Stock” shall mean all
shares of Common Stock issued by the Corporation, or deemed issued as provided in Section
6.8(c) below, whether or not subsequently reacquired or retired by the Corporation, other than:

(A) — shares of Common Stock issued or issuable upon
conversion of the outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock;

(B) up to 5,176,050 shares of Common Stock (or
options, warrants or rights therefor) (such number of shares to be calculated net of any
repurchases of such shares by the Corporation and net of any such expired or terminated options,
warrants or rights and to be adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations or the
like) granted or issued hereafter to employees, officers, directors, contractors, consultants or
advisers to, the Corporation or any Subsidiary pursuant to incentive agreements, stock purchase
or stock option plans, stock bonuses or awards, warrants, contracts or other arrangements that are
approved by the Board;

(C) any shares of the Corporation’s Common Stock or
Preferred Stock (and/or options or warrants therefore) issued to parties that are (i) strategic
partners in connection with a commercial relationship with the Corporation primarily for other
than equity financing purposes, (ii) suppliers of goods or services to the Corporation or (iii)
providing the Corporation with equipment leases, real property leases, loans, credit lines,
guaranties of indebtedness, cash price reductions or similar transactions, under arrangements, in
each case, approved by the Board (with the concurrence of at least a majority of the Preferred
Directors);

(D) — shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock issued
pursuant to the acquisition of another corporation or entity by the Corporation by consolidation,

all of the assets of such other corporation or entity or fifty percent (50%) or more of the voting
power of such other corporation or entity or fifty percent (50%) or more of the equity ownership

10
24223/00010/D0CS/1533370.4
the purchase of less than a fifty percent (50%) equity ownership in connection with a joint
venture or other strategic arrangement or other commercial relationship, provided such an
arrangement is approved by the Board (with the concurrence of at least a majority of the
Preferred Directors);

(E) shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock
issuable upon exercise of any options, warrants or rights to purchase any securities of the
Corporation outstanding as of the date of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation and any
securities issuable upon the conversion thereof;

(F) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable in a
Qualified Public Offering; and

(G) any shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock (or
options, or warrants or rights to acquire same) issued or issuable hereafter that are approved by
the vote of the holders of at least sixty percent (60%) of the outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred Stock, voting as a single class, as being excluded from the definition of “Additional
Shares of Common Stock” under this subparagraph 6.8(b).

(ii) The “Aggregate Consideration Received” by the
Corporation for any issue or sale (or deemed issue or sale) of securities shall (A) to the extent it
consists of cash, be computed at the gross amount of cash received by the Corporation before
deduction of any underwriting or similar commissions, compensation or concessions paid or
allowed by the Corporation in connection with such issue or sale and without deduction of any
expenses payable by the Corporation; (B) to the extent it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair value of that property as determined in good faith by the Board; and (C) if
Additional Shares of Common Stock, Convertible Securities or Rights or Options to purchase
either Additional Shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities are issued or sold together
with other stock or securities or other assets of the Corporation for a consideration which covers
both, be computed as the portion of the consideration so received that may be reasonably
determined in good faith by the Board to be allocable to such Additional Shares of Common
Stock, Convertible Securities or Rights or Options.

(iii) The “Common Stock Equivalents Outstanding” shall
mean the number of shares of Common Stock that is equal to the sum of (A) all shares of
Common Stock of the Corporation that are outstanding at the time in question, plus (B) all shares
of Common Stock of the Corporation issuable upon conversion of all shares of Preferred Stock
or other Convertible Securities that are outstanding at the time in question, plus (C) all shares of
Common Stock of the Corporation that are issuable upon the exercise of Rights or Options that
are outstanding at the time in question assuming the full conversion or exchange into Common
Stock of all such Rights or Options that are Rights or Options to purchase or acquire Convertible
Securities into or for Common Stock.

(iv) The “Convertible Securities” shall mean stock or other
securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock.

(v) The “Effective Price” of Additional Shares of Common
Stock shall mean the quotient determined by dividing the total number of Additional Shares of
Common Stock issued or sold, or deemed to have been issued or sold, by the Corporation under

11
24223/00010/DOCS/1533370.4
this subsection 6.8, into the Aggregate Consideration Received, or deemed to have been
received, by the Corporation under this subsection 6.8, for the issue of such Additional Shares of
Common Stock; and

(vi) The “Rights or Options” shall mean warrants, options or
other rights to purchase or acquire shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities.

(c) Deemed Issuances. For the purpose of making any adjustment to
the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock required under this subsection 6.8, if the
Corporation issues or sells any Rights or Options or Convertible Securities and if the Effective
Price of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Rights or Options and/or the
conversion or exchange of Convertible Securities (computed without reference to any additional
or similar protective or antidilution clauses) is less than the Conversion Price then in effect for a
series of Preferred Stock, then the Corporation shall be deemed to have issued (each a “Deemed
Issuance’’), at the time of the issuance of such Rights, Options or Convertible Securities, that
number of Additional Shares of Common Stock that is equal to the maximum number of shares
of Common Stock issuable upon exercise or conversion of such Rights, Options or Convertible
Securities upon their issuance and to have received, as the Aggregate Consideration Received for
the issuance of such shares, an amount equal to the total amount of the consideration, if any,
received by the Corporation for the issuance of such Rights or Options or Convertible Securities,
plus, in the case of such Rights or Options, the minimum amounts of consideration, if any,
payable to the Corporation upon the exercise in full of such Rights or Options, plus, in the case
of Convertible Securities, the minimum amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the
Corporation (other than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such
Convertible Securities) upon the conversion or exchange thereof; provided that:

(i) if the minimum amounts of such consideration cannot be
ascertained in such Deemed Issuance, but are a function of antidilution or similar protective
clauses, then the Corporation shall be deemed to have received the minimum amounts of
consideration without reference to such clauses;

(ii) if the minimum amount of consideration payable to the
Corporation upon the exercise of Rights or Options or the conversion or exchange of Convertible
Securities is reduced over time or upon the occurrence or non-occurrence of specified events
other than by reason of antidilution or similar protective adjustments, then the Effective Price
shall be recalculated using the figure to which such minimum amount of consideration is
reduced; and

(iii) if the minimum amount of consideration payable to the
Corporation upon the exercise of such Rights or Options or the conversion or exchange of
Convertible Securities is subsequently increased, then the Effective Price shall again be
recalculated using the increased minimum amount of consideration payable to the Corporation
upon the exercise of such Rights or Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities.

No further adjustment of the Conversion Price, adjusted upon the issuance of such
Rights or Options or Convertible Securities, shall be made as a result of the actual issuance of
shares of Common Stock on the exercise of any such Rights or Options or the conversion or
exchange of any such Convertible Securities. If any such Rights or Options or the conversion

12
24223/00010/D0CS/1533370.4
rights represented by any such Convertible Securities shall expire without having been fully
exercised, then the Conversion Price as adjusted upon the issuance of such Rights or Options or
Convertible Securities shall be readjusted to the Conversion Price which would have been in
effect had an adjustment been made on the basis that the only shares of Common Stock so issued
were the shares of Common Stock, if any, that were actually issued or sold on the exercise of
such Rights or Options or rights of conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, and
such shares of Common Stock, if any, were issued or sold for the consideration actually received
by the Corporation upon such exercise, plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the
Corporation for the granting of all such Rights or Options, whether or not exercised, plus the
consideration received for issuing or selling all such Convertible Securities actually converted or
exchanged, plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the Corporation (other than by
cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities) on the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, provided that such readjustment shall not
apply to prior conversions of Preferred Stock.

6.9 Certificate of Adjustment. In each case of an adjustment or readjustment
of the Conversion Price for a series of Preferred Stock, the Corporation, at its expense, shall
cause its Chief Financial Officer to compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with
the provisions hereof and prepare a certificate showing such adjustment or readjustment, and
promptly following the triggering event date of such adjustment or readjustment shall mail such
certificate, by first class mail, postage prepaid, to each registered holder of the Preferred Stock at
the holder’s address as shown in the Corporation’s books.

6.10 Payment of Taxes. The Corporation will pay all taxes (other than taxes
based upon income or capital gain) and other governmental charges that may be imposed with
respect to the issue and delivery of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of shares of Series
A Preferred Stock, excluding any tax or other charge imposed in connection with any transfer
involved in the issue and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in which
the shares of Series A Preferred Stock so converted were registered.

6.11 Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued
upon any conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional share to which the holder
would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay the holder cash equal to the product of
such fraction multiplied by the Common Stock’s fair market value as determined in good faith
by the Board as of the date of conversion.

6.12 Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at
all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock,
solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock, such
number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shail not be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate
action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose,

6.13 Notices of Record Date. In the event that the Corporation shall propose at
any time (i) to declare any dividend or distribution; (ii) to offer for subscription to the holders of
any class or series of its stock any additional shares of stock or other rights; (iii) to effect any

13
24223/00010/D0CS/1533370.4
reclassification or recapitalization; or (iv) to effect a Change of Control, liquidation, dissolution
or winding up of the Corporation; then, in connection with each such event, the Corporation shall
send to the holders of the Preferred Stock at least 15 days’ prior written notice of the date on
which a record shall be taken for such dividend, distribution or subscription rights (and
specifying the date on which the holders of stock shall be entitled thereto) or for determining
rights to vote in respect of the matters referred to in clauses (iii) and (iv) above; provided
however that the notice provisions set forth in this Section may be shortened or waived
prospectively or retrospectively by the vote or written consent of the holders of at least sixty
percent (60%) of the Series A Preferred Stock, voting as a single class.

6.14 Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Restated Certificate
of Incorporation to be given to the holders of shares of the Preferred Stock shall be deemed given
upon the earlier of actual receipt or deposit in the United States mail, by certified or registered
mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or delivery by a recognized express courier, fees
prepaid, addressed to each holder of record at the address of such holder appearing on the books
of the Corporation.

6.15 No Impairment. The Corporation shall not, without the appropriate vote
of the stockholders under the Delaware General Corporation Law or Section 7 of this Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the
terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Corporation, but shall at all times in good
faith assist in carrying out all such action as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate in order
to protect the rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of the Preferred Stock against
impairment.

7. Restrictions and Limitations.

So long as at least 1,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock remain
outstanding (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations or the like, with
respect to the Series A Preferred Stock), the Corporation shall not, directly or indirectly (whether
by merger, consolidation or otherwise), without the approval, by vote or written consent, of the
holders of at least sixty percent (60%) of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding:

(a) alter or change the rights, preferences, privileges or restrictions of
the Preferred Stock by amending its Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws;

(b) increase or decrease the total number of authorized shares of
Common Stock or Preferred Stock;

(c) authorize or create any capital stock having rights, preferences or
privileges being on a parity with, or senior to, the Series A Preferred Stock;

(d) enter into, or agree to enter into, any transaction constituting a
Change of Control or transfer a material portion of the Corporation’s assets to any third party
other than a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation (other than the sale, transfer, license or
grant of licenses that are incidental to sales of the Corporation’s products in the ordinary course
of business);

(e) change the authorized number of members of its Board;

24223/00010/D0CS/1533370.4
(f) set aside, declare or pay any dividends (other than dividends

outstanding; or

(g) effect any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation.

8. Miscellaneous

8.1 No Reissuance of Preferred Stock. No share or shares of Preferred Stock
acquired by the Corporation by reason of redemption, purchase, conversion or otherwise shall be
reissued, and all such shares shall be cancelled, retired and eliminated from the shares which the
Corporation shall be authorized to issue.

8.2 Preemptive Rights. No stockholder of the Corporation shall have a right
to purchase shares of capital stock of the Corporation sold or issued by the Corporation except to
the extent that such a right may from time to time be set forth in a written agreement between the
Corporation and such stockholder.

ARTICLE VI

Except as otherwise provided in this Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Board
shall have the power to adopt, amend or repeal Bylaws of the corporation.

ARTICLE VII

To the fullest extent permitted by law, no director of the Corporation shall be personally
liable for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. Without limiting the
effect of the preceding sentence, if the Delaware General Corporation Law is hereafter amended
to authorize the further elimination or limitation of the liability of a director, then the liability of
a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the
Delaware General Corporation Law, as so amended.

The Corporation shall indemnify to the fullest extent permitted by law any person made
or threatened to be made a party to an action or proceeding whether criminal, civil,
administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he, his testator or intestate is or was a
director or officer of the Corporation or any predecessor of the Corporation or serves or served at
any other enterprise as a director or officer at the request of the Corporation or any predecessor
to the Corporation to the same extent as permitted under the preceding paragraph above.

The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director,
officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise against any such expense, liability or loss, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or
loss under the Delaware General Corporation Law.

Neither any amendment nor repeal of this Article VIII, nor the adoption of any provision
of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this Article VIII, shall eliminate,

15
24223/00010/D0CS/1533370.4
reduce or otherwise adversely affect any limitation on the personal liability of a director of the
Corporation existing at the time of such amendment, repeal or adoption of such an inconsistent
provision.

ARTICLE VIII

In the event that a director of the Corporation who is also a partner or employee of an
entity that is a holder of Preferred Stock and that is in the business of investing and reinvesting in
other entities (each, a “Fund’), acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter in such
person’s capacity as a partner or employee of the Fund and that may be a corporate opportunity
for both the Corporation and such Fund, such director shall to the fullest extent permitted by law
have fully satisfied and fulfilled his fiduciary duty to the Corporation and its stockholders with
respect to such corporate opportunity, and the Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by law
waives any claim that such business opportunity constituted a corporate opportunity that should
have been presented to the Corporation or any of its affiliates, if such director acts in good faith
in a manner consistent with the following policy: a corporate opportunity offered to any person
who is a director of the Corporation, and who is also a partner or employee of a Fund shall
belong to such Fund, unless such opportunity was expressly offered to such person solely in his
or her capacity as a director of the Corporation.

ARTICLE 1X

Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed between the Corporation and its
creditors or any class of them and/or between the Corporation and its stockholders or any class of
them, any court of equitable jurisdiction within the State of Delaware may, on the application in
a summary way of the Corporation or of any creditor or stockholder thereof or on the application
of any receiver or receivers appointed for the Corporation under the provisions of Section 291 of
the Delaware General Corporation Law or on the application of trustees in dissolution or of any
receiver or receivers appointed for this Corporation under Section 279 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law order a meeting of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders
or class of stockholders of the Corporation, as the case may be, to be summoned in such manner
as the said court directs. If a majority in number representing three-fourths in value of the
creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of the Cor-
poration, as the case may be, agree to any compromise or arrangement and to any reorganization
of the Corporation as a consequence of such compromise or arrangement, the said compromise
or arrangement and the said reorganization shall, if sanctioned by the court to which the said
application has been made, be binding on all the creditors or class of creditors, and/or on all the
stockholders or class of stockholders, of the Corporation, as the case may be, and also on the
Corporation.
