pursuant to this Section 3(g). Prior to the distribution or redemption provided for in this Section 3(g), the
Corporation shall not expend or dissipate the consideration received for such Deemed Liquidation Event,
except to discharge expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business.

(h) The amount deemed paid or distributed to the holders of capital stock of
the Corporation upon any such merger, consolidation, sale, lease, transfer, exclusive license, other
disposition or redemption shall be the cash or the value of the property, rights or securities paid or
distributed to such holders by the Corporation or the acquiring person, firm or other entity. If the amount
deemed paid or distributed under this Section B.3(h) is made in property other than in cash, the value of
such distribution shall be the fair market value of such property, determined as follows:

(i) for securities traded on a securities exchange or through The
Nasdaq Stock Market, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities
on such exchange or market over the 30 calendar day period ending three days prior to the closing of such
transaction, or

(ii) for securities actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the 30 calendar
day period ending three days prior to the closing of such transaction; or

(iii) for securities for which there is no active public market, the
value shall be the fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation.

(i) On the effective date of any Acquisition or Asset Transfer, the
Corporation shall pay to the holders of Series Preferred all cash and other consideration to which the
holders of Series Preferred shall be entitled under this Section B.3. Upon receipt of such payment, each
holder of shares of Series Preferred shall surrender the certificate or certificates representing such shares,
duly assigned or endorsed for transfer to the Corporation (or accompanied by duly executed stock powers
relating thereto), at the principal executive office of the Corporation or the offices of the transfer agent for
the Corporation, or shall notify the Corporation or any transfer agent that such certificates have been lost,
Stolen or destroyed and shall execute an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the
Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificate, and each surrendered
certificate shall be canceled and retired.

A RMMEMALE 4
(j) Distribution of Remaining Assets. After the payment or setting aside
for payment to the holders of Series Preferred of the full amounts specified in this Section 3, the entire
remaining assets of the Corporation legally available for distribution shall be distributed pro rata to
holders of the Common Stock of the Corporation in proportion to the number of shares of Common Stock
held by them.

4. Optional Conversion.

The holders of the Series C Preferred shall have conversion rights as follows (the “Conversion
Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Series Preferred Stock shall be
convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time and from time to time, and without the
payment of additional consideration by the holder thereof, into such number of fully paid and non-
assessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the applicable Original Issue Price for
the applicable Series Preferred by the applicable Conversion Price for such Series Preferred in effect at
the time of conversion. The Conversion Price of each series of Series Preferred is referred to herein as the
“Conversion Price”. The “Series Al Conversion Price” shall initially be equal to $1.00. The “Series B
Conversion Price” shall initially be equal to $1.07842. The “Series B2 Conversion Price” shall initially
be equal to $1.12. The “Serfes C Conversion Price” shall initially be equal to $2.30. Such initial
Conversion Prices, and the rate at which shares of Series Preferred may be converted into shares of
Common Stock, shall be subject to adjustment as provided below. In the event of a notice of redemption
of any shares of Series B Preferred, Series B2 Preferred or Series C Preferred pursuant to Section 6
hereof, the Conversion Rights of the shares designated for redemption shall terminate at the close of
business on the last full day preceding the date fixed for redemption, unless the redemption price is not
paid on such redemption date, in which case the Conversion Rights for such shares shall continue until
such price is paid in full.

(b) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be
issued upon conversion of any Series Preferred. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would
otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair market
value of a share of Common Stock as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation. Whether or not fractional shares would be issuable upon such conversion shall be
determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Series Preferred the holder is at the time
converting into Common Stock and the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such
conversion.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion.

(i) In order for a holder of Series Preferred to voluntarily convert
shares of Series Preferred into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the certificate or
certificates for such shares of Series Preferred (or, if such registered holder alleges that such certificate
has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to the
Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on
account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate), at the office of the transfer agent for
the Series Preferred (or at the principal office of the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own
transfer agent), together with written notice that such holder elects to convert all or any number of the
shares of the Series Preferred represented by such certificate or certificates and, if applicable, any event
on which such conversion is contingent. Such notice shall state such holder's name or the names of the
nominees in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be
issued. If required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or

10

+ MITMEBOLE 4
accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form reasonably satisfactory to the
Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or such holder’s attorney duly authorized in writing.
The close of business on the date of receipt by the transfer agent of such certificates (or lost certificate
affidavit and agreement) and notice (or by the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer
agent) shall be the time of conversion (the “Conversion Time”), and the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon conversion of the shares represented by such certificate shall be deemed to be outstanding
of record as of such date. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after the Conversion Time, issue
and deliver at such office to such holder of Series Preferred, or to such holder’s nominees, a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled, together
with cash in lieu of any fraction of a share.

(ii) The Corporation shall at all times when a series of Series
Preferred shall be outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued stock, for the
purpose of effecting the conversion of such Series Preferred, such number of its duly authorized shares of
Common Stock as shal] from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares
of such Series Preferred; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common
Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of such Series
Preferred, the Corporation shall take such corporate action as may be necessary to increase its authorized
but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes,
including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any
necessary amendment to this Certificate of Incorporation. Before taking any action which would cause an
adjustment reducing the Conversion Price of any Series Preferred below the then par value of the shares
of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such Series Preferred, the Corporation will take any
corporate action which may be necessary in order that the Corporation may validly and legally issue fully
paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion Price.

(iii) All shares of Series Preferred which shal] have been surrendered
for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights with respect
to such shares, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and to vote, shall immediately cease and
terminate at the Conversion Time, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive shares of
Common Stock in exchange therefor and to receive payment of any dividends declared but unpaid
thereon. Any shares of Series Preferred so converted shall be retired and cancelled and shall not be
reissued as shares of such series, and the Corporation (without the need for stockholder action) may from
time to time take such appropriate action as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares
of Series Preferred accordingly.

(iv) | Upon any such conversion, no adjustment to the applicable
Conversion Price shall be made for any declared but unpaid dividends on the Series Preferred surrendered
for conversion or on the Common Stock delivered upon conversion.

(v) The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and other similar
taxes that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon
conversion of shares of Series Preferred pursuant to this Section 4(c). The Corporation shall not,
however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the
issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in which the shares of Series
Preferred so converted were registered, and no such issuance or delivery shall be made unless and until
the person or entity requesting such issuance has paid to the Corporation the amount of any such tax or
has established, to the satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax has been paid.

Options outstanding as of the Original Issue Date, up to a maximum of 2,303,836 shares (or such higher
number of shares as approved by written consent or affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority
of the then outstanding shares of Series C Stock) plus any shares of Common Stock repurchased from
former employees, officers, directors, consultants or other persons who performed services for the
Corporation or any subsidiary who acquired such shares directly from the Corporation, if each such
purchase is made pursuant to contractual rights held by the Corporation relating to the termination of
employment or other business relationship of such former employee, officer, director, consultant or other
person and the purchase price does not exceed the lesser of (x) the original issue price paid by such
former employee, officer, director, consultant or other person for such shares or (y) the then fair market
value of such shares, provided, however, that such purchase is approved by a majority of the then

(C) shares of Common Stock or Convertible
Securities actually issued upon the exercise of Options or shares of Common Stock actually issued upon
the conversion or exchange of Convertible Securities, in each case provided such issuance is pursuant to
the terms of such Option or Convertible Security.

(e) No Adjustment of Conversion Price. No adjustment in any Conversion
Price shall be made as the result of the issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock if: (a) the
consideration per share (determined pursuant to Section 4(h)) for such Additional Shares of Common

1 NITMEMOLL A
Preferred agreeing that no such adjustment shall be made as the result of the issuance or deemed issuance
of such Additional Shares of Common Stock.

(f) Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock.

Gi) If the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the
Original Issue Date shall issue any Options or Convertible Securities (excluding Options or Convertible
Securities which, upon exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, would entitle the holder thereof to
receive Exempted Securities pursuant to Sections 4(d)(iX4)(A), (B), or (C)) or shall fix a record date for
the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive any such Options or Convertible
Securities, then the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set forth in the instrument relating
thereto, assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to exercisability, convertibility or exchangeability but
without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable
upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities and Options therefor, the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to be Additional Shares of
Common Stock issued as of the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as
of the close of business on such record date.

(ii) If the terms of any Option or Convertible Security, the issuance
of which resulted in an adjustment to any Conversion Price pursuant to the terms of Section 4(g) below,
are revised (either automatically pursuant to the provisions contained therein or as a result of an
amendment to such terms) to provide for either (1) any increase or decrease in the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any such Option or Convertible
Security or (2) any increase or decrease in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon such
exercise, conversion or exchange, then, effective upon such increase or decrease becoming effective, the
Conversion Prices computed upon the original issue of such Option or Convertible Security (or upon the
occurrence of a record date with respect thereto) shall be readjusted to such Conversion Price as would
have obtained had such revised terms been in effect upon the original date of issuance of such Option or
Convertible Security. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment pursuant to this clause (B) shall have
the effect of increasing the applicable Conversion Price to an amount which exceeds the lower of (i) such
Conversion Price on the original adjustment date, or (ii) the Conversion Price that would have resulted
from any issuances of Additional Shares of Common Stock between the original adjustment date and such
readjustment date.

(iii) | If the terms of any Option or Convertible Security (excluding
Options or Convertible Securities which, upon exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, would entitle the
holder thereof to receive Exempted Securities pursuant to Sections 4(d)(i}(4)(A), (B), or (C)), the issuance
of which did not result in an adjustment to a Conversion Price pursuant to the terms of Section 4(g) below
(cither becausc the consideration per share (determined pursuant to Section 4(h) hereof) of the Additional
Shares of Common Stock subject thereto was equal to or greater than such Conversion Price then in
effect, or because such Option or Convertible Security was issued before the Original Issue Date), are
revised after the Original Issue Date (cither automatically pursuant to the provisions contained therein or
as a result of an amendment to such terms) to provide for either (1) any increase or decrease in the
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any such
Option or Convertible Security or (2) any increase or decrease in the consideration payable to the
Corporation upon such exercise, conversion or exchange, then such Option or Convertible Security, as so
amended, and the Additional Shares of Common Stock subject thereto (determined in the manner
provided in Section 4(f){i) above) shall be deemed to have been issued effective upon such increase or
decrease becoming effective.

VMI ETOLE 4
(iv) | Upon the expiration or termination of any unexercised Option or
unconverted or unexchanged Convertible Security which resulted (either upon its original issuance or
upon a revision of its terms) in an adjustment to any Conversion Prices pursuant to the terms of Section
4(g) below, such Conversion Prices shall be readjusted to the Conversion Price as would have obtained
had such Option or Convertible Security never been issued.

(g) Adjustment of Series Conversion Prices Upon Issuance of Additional
Shares of Common Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Original Issue Date
issue Additional Shares of Common Stock (including Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to be
issued pursuant to Section 4(f)), without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the
applicable Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issue, then such Conversion Price shall be
reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent)
determined in accordance with the following formula:

CP, = CP; * (A+B)+(A+C)

For purposes of the foregoing formula, the following definitions shall apply:

“CP,” shall mean the Conversion Price in effect immediately after such
issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock

“CP,” shall mean the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to
such issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock;

“A” shall mean the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding and
deemed outstanding immediately prior to such issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock
(treating for this purpose as outstanding all shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
Options outstanding immediately prior to such issuance with an exercise price that is then less
than CP, or upon conversion of Convertible Securities (including the Series Preferred)
outstanding immediately prior to such issue);

“B” shall mean the number of shares of Common Stock that would have
been issued if such Additional Shares of Common Stock had been issued at a price per share
equal to CP, (determined by dividing the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation in
respect of such issue by CP); and

“C” shall mean the number of such Additional Shares of Common Stock
issued in such transaction.

(h) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this Section 4, the
consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional Shares of Common Stock shall
be computed as follows:

(i) Cash and Property: Such consideration shall:

14

VME MwoLe 4
(1) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
aggregate amount of cash received by the Corporation, excluding amounts paid or payable for accrued
interest,

(2) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair market value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors of the Corporation; and

(3) in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock are
issued together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for consideration which
covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in clauses (1) and
(2) above, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

(ii) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per
share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued
pursuant to Section 4(f), relating to Options and Convertible Securities, shall be determined by dividing:

(1) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the
Corporation as consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the minimum
aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without
regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration) payable to
the Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options for
Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, by

(2) the maximum oumber of shares of Common Stock (as
set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a
subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities.

(i) Multiple Closing Dates. In the event the Corporation shall issue on
more than one date Additional Shares of Common Stock that are a part of one transaction or a series of
related transactions and that would result in an adjustment to any Conversion Price pursuant to the terms
of Section 4(g) above, and such issuance dates occur within a period of no more than 30 days from the
first such issuance to the final such issuance, then, upon the final such issuance, the Conversion Price
shall be readjusted to give effect to all such issuances as if they occurred on the date of the first such
issuance (and without giving effect to any adjustments as a result of any subsequent issuances within such
period).

(j) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If the Corporation
shall at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date effect a subdivision of the outstanding
Common Stock without a comparable subdivision of any Series Preferred, the Conversion Price of each
such Series Preferred in effect immediately before that subdivision shal! be proportionately decreased so
that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such Series Preferred
shall be increased in proportion to such increase in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding. If the Corporation shall at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date
combine the outstanding shares of any Series Preferred without a comparable combination of the
Common Stock, the Conversion Price of each such Series Preferred in effect immediately before that
subdivision or combination shall be proportionately decreased so that the number of shares of Common
Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such Series Preferred shall be increased in proportion to
such increase in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. If the Corporation shall

15

V mere LoeE A
at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date combine the outstanding shares of Common
Stock without a comparable combination of any Series Preferred, the Conversion Prices in effect
immediately before the combination or subdivision shall be proportionately increased so that the number
of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each such Series Preferred shall be decreased in
proportion to such decrease in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. If the
Corporation shall at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date effect a subdivision of the
outstanding shares of the any Series Preferred without 2 comparable subdivision of the Common Stock,
the Conversion Price for each such Series Preferred in effect immediately before the combination or
subdivision shall be proportionately increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on
conversion of each such Series Preferred shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in the
aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. Any adjustment under this Section shall
become effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective.

«&) Adjustment for Certain Dividends and Distributions. If the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall make or issue, or fix a
record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other
distribution payable on the Common Stock in additional shares of Common Stock, then and in each such
event each Conversion Price in effect immediately before such event shall be decreased as of the time of
such issuance or, in the event such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such
record date, by multiplying the applicable Conversion Prices then in effect by a fraction:

(i) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of
business on such record date, and

(ii) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of
business on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such
dividend or distribution;

provided, however, that if such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend is not fully paid or if
such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, each Conversion Price shall be recomputed
accordingly as of the close of business on such record date and thereafter the Conversion Price shall be
adjusted pursuant to this Section as of the time of actual payment of such dividends or distributions.

() Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. If the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall make or issue, or fix a
record date for the determination of holders of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to receive, a
dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the Corporation (other than a distribution of shares
of Common Stock in respect of outstanding shares of Common Stock) or in other property and the
provisions of Section B.1 do not apply to such dividend or distribution, then and in each such event the
holders of Series Preferred shall receive, simultaneously with the distribution to the holders of such
capita! stock, a dividend or other distribution of such securities or other property in an amount equal to
the amount of such securities or other property as they would have received if all outstanding Series
Preferred had been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event.

(m) Adjustment for Merger or Reorganization, etc. Subject to the
provisions of Section 3(e), if there shall occur any reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
consolidation or merger involving the Corporation in which the Common Stock, but not each Series
Preferred (each such non-involved Series a “‘Non-Involved Series”), is converted into or exchanged for
securities, cash or other property (other than a transaction covered by Sections (j), (k) or (1) of this Section

16

VIM THIEN L OLE aA
4), then, following any such reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger,
each share of such Non-Involved Series shall thereafter be convertible in lieu of the Common Stock into
which it was convertible prior to such event into the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property
which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation issuable upon conversion of
one share of such Non-Involved Series immediately prior to such reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, consolidation or merger would have been entitled to receive pursuant to such transaction;
and, in such case, appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation) shall be made in the application of the provisions in this Section 4(m) with respect to the
rights and interests thereafter of the holders of the Non-Involved Series, to the end that the provisions set
forth in this Section 4 (including provisions with respect to changes in and other adjustments of the
applicable Conversion Price of each Non-Involved Series) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as
reasonably may be, in relation to any securities or other property thereafter deliverable upon the
conversion of the Non-Involved Series.

(n) Notice of Record Date. In the event:

(i) the Corporation shal! take a record of the holders of its Common
Stock (or other stock or securities at the time issuable upon conversion of any Series Preferred) for the
purpose of entitling or enabling them to receive any dividend or other distribution, or to receive any right
to subscribe for or purchase any shares of stock of any class or any other securities, or to receive any
other right; or

(ii) of any capital reorganization of the Corporation, any
reclassification of the Common Stock of the Corporation, or any Deemed Liquidation Event; or

(iii) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or
winding-up of the Corporation,

then, and in each such case, the Corporation will send or cause to be sent to the holders of the Series
Preferred a notice specifying, as the case may be, (i) the record date for such dividend, distribution or
right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right, or (ii) the effective date on
which such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or
winding-up is proposed to take place, and the time, if any is to be fixed, as of which the holders of record
of Common Stock (or such other stock or securities at the time issuable upon the conversion of the Series
Preferred) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock (or such other stock or securities)
for securities or other property deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation,
merger, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, and the amount per share and character of such
exchange applicable to the Series Preferred and the Common Stock. Such notice shal] be sent at least 20
days prior to the record date or effective date for the event specified in such notice. Any notice required
by the provisions hereof to be given to a holder of Series Preferred shall be deemed seat to such holder if
deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to such holder at his, her or its address
appearing on the books of the Corporation.

(0) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment
or readjustment of any Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation at its expense shall, as
promptly as reasonably practicable but in any event not later than 10 days thereafter, compute such
adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to each holder of Series
Preferred a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment (including the kind and amount of
securities, cash or other property into which such Series Preferred is convertible) and showing in detail
the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the written request at any time of any holder of Series Preferred (but in any

17

VDT ENLOLE 4
event not later than 10 days thereafter), furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a certificate setting
forth (i) the Conversion Price then in effect, and (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the
amount, if any, of other securities, cash or property which then would be received upon the conversion of
such Series Preferred.

5. Mandatory Conversion.

(a) All shares of each Series Preferred shall be converted automatically into
the number of shares of the Corporation’s Common Stock into which such shares of Series Preferred are
then convertible under Section B.4, all in accordance with the terms of this Section 5, immediately prior
to the consummation of a Qualified IPO. All shares of any particular Series Preferred shall be converted
automatically into the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series Preferred are
then convertible under Section B.4, all in accordance with the terms of this Section 5, upon the approval
(by vote or written consent, as provided by law) by the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding
shares of such Series Preferred (voting separately as a single class) to have all of the then outstanding
shares of such Series Preferred converted. Al! such shares of Series Preferred may not be reissued by the
Corporation as shares of such Series. The date upon which any such Series Preferred are converted under
this Section 5 is referred to as the “Mandatory Conversion Date.”

(b) All holders of record of shares of Series Preferred or any specific Series
Preferred, as applicable, shall be given written notice of the Mandatory Conversion Date and the place
designated for mandatory conversion of all such shares of Series Preferred pursuant to this Section 5.
Such notice need not be given in advance of the occurrence of the Mandatory Conversion Date. Such
notice shall be sent by first class or registered mail, postage prepaid, or given by electronic
communication in compliance with the provisions of the General Corporation Law, to each record holder
of Series Preferred as applicable. Upon receipt of such notice, each holder of shares of the applicable
Series Preferred shall surrender his, her or its certificate or certificates for all such shares to the
Corporation at the place designated in such notice, and shal! thereafter receive certificates for the number
of shares of Common Stock to which such bolder is entitled pursuant to this Section 5. On the Mandatory
Conversion Date, all outstanding shares of the applicable Series Preferred shall be deemed to have been
converted into shares of Common Stock, which shal! be deemed to be outstanding of record, and all rights
with respect to such Series Preferred so converted, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and vote
(other than as a holder of Common Stock), will terminate, except only the rights of the holders thereof,
upon surrender of their certificate or certificates therefor, to receive certificates for the number of shares
of Common Stock into which such Series Preferred has been converted, and payment of any declared but
unpaid dividends thereon. If so required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall
be endorsed or accompanied by written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the
Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or by his, her or its attorney duly authorized in
writing. As soon as practicable after the Mandatory Conversion Date and the surrender of the certificate
or certificates for Series Preferred, the Corporation shall cause to be issued and delivered to such holder,
or on his, her or its written order, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common
Stock issuable on such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof and cash as provided in

Section 4(b) in respect of any fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such
conversion.

(c) All certificates evidencing shares of Series Preferred which are required
to be surrendered for conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof shall, from and after the
Mandatory Conversion Date, be deemed to have been retired and cancelled and the shares of Series
Preferred represented thereby converted into Common Stock for all purposes, notwithstanding the failure
of the holder or holders thereof to surrender such certificates on or prior to such date. Such converted
Series Preferred may not be reissued as shares of such Series, and the Corporation may thereafter take

18

y MITME“LOLE A
such appropriate action (without the need for stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the
authorized number of shares of Series Preferred accordingly.

6. Redemption. The Corporation shall not have the right to call or redeem at any
time all or any shares of Preferred Stock, except as set forth in this Section 6.

(a) Series C Redemption. At any time on or after the fifth anniversary of
the Original Issue Date, the holders of a majority of the then outstanding Series C Preferred may request
that the Corporation redeem all of the outstanding shares of Series Preferred pursuant to the terms of this
Section 6 (the “Series C Redemption Request”). Upon receipt of the Series C Redemption Request, the
shares of Series C Preferred shall be redeemed by the Corporation, for cash out of funds lawfully
available therefor, at a per share redemption price (the “Series C Redemption Price”) equal to the
greater of: (i) the Series C Original Issuance Price plus an amount equal to all Accruing Dividends unpaid
thereon (whether or not declared) and any other dividends declared but unpaid thereon, computed to the
date of payment, or (ii) the as-converted to Common Stock value determined by reference to the then fair
market value of the Corporation, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation, in two equal annual installments commencing upon the date 120 days after the receipt of the
Series C Redemption Request by the Corporation (such date of each such installment being referred to as
a “Series C Redemption Date”). On each Series C Redemption Date, the Corporation shall redeem, on a
pro rata basis in accordance with the number of shares of Series C Preferred owned by each holder that
number of outstanding shares of Series C Preferred determined by dividing (i) the total number of shares
of Series C Preferred outstanding immediately prior to such Series C Redemption Date by (ii) the number
of remaining Series C Redemption Dates (including the Series C Redemption Date to which such
calculation applies). If the Corporation does not have sufficient funds legally available to redeem on any
Series C Redemption Date all shares of Series C Preferred and of any other class or series of stock to be
redeemed on such Series C Redemption Date, the Corporation shall redeem a pro rata portion of each
holder's redeemable shares of such stock out of funds legally available therefor, based on the respective
amounts which would otherwise be payable in respect of the shares to be redeemed if the legally available
funds were sufficient to redeem all such shares, and shall redeem the remaining shares to have been
redeemed as soon as practicable after the Corporation has funds legally available therefor.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary provided in this Certificate of Incorporation,
the Corporation shall not redeem any shares of any other series of Preferred Stock or otherwise so long as
at least 50% of the shares of Series C Preferred issued on the Original Issue Date (as adjusted for stock
dividends, splits, combinations or recapitalizations) remain outstanding.

(b) Series B/B2 Redemption. At any time on or after the fifth anniversary
of the Original Issue Date, the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series B Preferred
and Series B2 Preferred, voting together as a single class, may request that the Corporation redeem all of
the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred and Series B2 Preferred pursuant to the terms of this Section
6 (the “Series B Redemption Request”). Upon receipt of the Series B Redemption Request, the shares
of Series B Preferred and Series B2 Preferred shall be redeemed pro rata by the Corporation, for cash out
of funds lawfully available therefor, at a per share redemption price (the “Series B Redemption Price”)
equa! to the greater of: (i) 150% of the Series B Original Issuance Price or Series B2 Original Issue Price,
as applicable, plus an amount equal to all Accruing Dividends unpaid thereon (whether or not declared)
and any other dividends declared but unpaid thereon, computed to the date of payment, or (ii) the as-
converted to Common Stock value determined by reference to the then fair market value of the
Corporation, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation, in two equal
annual installments commencing upon the date 120 days after the receipt of the Series B Redemption
Request by the Corporation (such date of each such installment being referred to as a “Series B
Redemption Date”). On each Series B Redemption Date, the Corporation shall redeem, on a pro rata
basis in accordance with the number of shares of Series B Preferred and Series B2 Preferred owned by

19

+ MTU EMOLE 4
each holder that number of outstanding shares of Series B and Series B2 Preferred determined by dividing
(i) the total number of shares of Series B Preferred and Series B2 Preferred outstanding immediately prior
to such Serics B Redemption Date by (ii) the number of remaining Series B Redemption Dates (including
the Series B Redemption Date to which such calculation applies). If the Corporation does not have
sufficient funds legally available to redeem on any Series B Redemption Date all shares of Series B
Preferred and Series B2 Preferred on such Redemption Date, the Corporation shall redeem a pro rata
portion of each holder’s redeemable shares of such stock out of funds legally available therefor, based on
the respective amounts which would otherwise be payable in respect of the shares to be redeemed if the
legally available funds were sufficient to redeem all such shares, and shall redeem the remaining shares to
have been redeemed as soon as practicable after the Corporation has funds legally available therefor. For
purposes hereof the Series C Redemption Request and Series B Redemption Request are collectively
referred to as a “Redemption Request,” Series C Redemption Price and Series B Redemption Price are
collectively referred to as a “Redemption Price,” and the Series C Redemption Date and the Series B
Redemption Date are collectively referred to as a ‘Redemption Date.”

(c) Redemption Notice. Written notice of the mandatory redemption
pursuant to this Section 6 (the “Redemption Notice”) shall be mailed, postage prepaid, to each holder of
record of Series C Preferred, Series B Preferred and Series B2 Preferred, as applicable, at its post office
address last shown on the records of the Corporation, not less than 40 days prior to each Redemption
Date. Each Redemption Notice shall state:

(i) the number of shares of Series Preferred held by the holder that
the Corporation shall redeem on the Redemption Date specified in the Redemption Notice;

(ii) the Redemption Date and the Redemption Price;

(iii) the date upon which the holder's right to convert such shares
terminates (as determined in accordance with Section 4(a)); and

(iv) that the holder is to surrender to the Corporation, in the manner
and at the place designated, such holder's certificate or certificates representing the shares of Series
Preferred to be redeemed.

(d) Surrender of Certificates; Payment. On or before the applicable
Redemption Date, each holder of shares of Series Preferred to be redeemed on such Redemption Date,
unless such holder has exercised such holder’s right to convert such shares as provided in Section 4
hereof, shall surrender the certificate or certificates representing such shares to the Corporation, in the
manner and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice, and thereupon the Redemption Price for
such shares shall be payable to the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or
certificates as the owner thereof, and each surrendered certificate shall be canceled and retired. In the
event less than all of the shares of any Series Preferred represented by a certificate are redeemed, a new
certificate representing the unredeemed shares of such Series Preferred shall promptly be issued to such
holder.

(e) Rights Subsequent to Redemption. If the Redemption Notice shall
have been duly given, and if on the applicable Redemption Date the Redemption Price payable upon
redemption of the shares of Series Preferred to be redeemed on such Redemption Date is paid or tendered
for payment or deposited with an independent payment agent so as to be available therefor, then
notwithstanding that the certificates evidencing any of the shares of Series Preferred so called for
redemption shall not have been surrendered, dividends with respect to such Series Preferred shall cease to
accrue after such Redemption Date and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith after such

Redemption Date terminate, except only the right of the holders to receive the Redemption Price without
interest upon surrender of their certificate or certificates therefor.

(f) Redeemed or Otherwise Acquired Shares. Any shares of Series
Preferred which are redeemed or otherwise acquired by the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries shall be
automatically and immediately canceled and shall not be reissued, sold or transferred. Neither the
Corporation nor any of its subsidiaries may exercise any voting or other rights granted to the holders of
Series Preferred following redemption.

(g) Failure to Redeem. If the Corporation fails, for any reasan or for no
reason, to redeem on any Redemption Date all of the then outstanding shares of Series Preferred required
to be redeemed in accordance with the terms and conditions of Section 6, then the holders of the then
outstanding shares of Series Preferred shall have the right to receive interest on the payment of their
respective Redemption Prices at a rate per annum equal to twelve percent (12%), which shall begin to
accrue 180 days following any such Redemption Date. Such interest shall be calculated on the basis of a
year of 365 days and for the number of days actually elapsed.

(h) Priority. The Series B Preferred and Series B2 Preferred shall rank (i)
junior to the Series C Preferred and (ii) senior to all other current and future series or class of capital stock
of the Corporation as it relates to redemption rights.

WAIVER OF REQUIREMENT
FOR AFFIDAVIT OF EXTRAORDINARY CONDITION

It appears to the Secretary of State that an earlier effort to deliver this instrument and
tender such taxes and fees was made in good faith on the file date stamped hereto. The
Secretary of State has determined that an extraordinary condition (as retlected in the
records of the Secretary of State) existed at such date and time and that such earlier effort
was unsuccessful as a result of the existence of such extraordinary condition, and that
such actual delivery and tender were made within a reasonable period (not to exceed two
business days) after the cessation of such extraordinary condition. The Secretary of
State hereby waives the requirement for an affidavit of extraordinary condition and
establishes such date and time as the filing date of such instrument.
