Stock into which each share of Series A Preferred Stock may be converted shall be determined
by dividing the Original Series A Issue Price by the Series A Conversion Price in effect on the
date that the holder thereof elects to convert such share. The initial Series A Conversion Price is

regardless of whether the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation
or its transfer agent; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue
certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion unless
certificates evidencing such shares of Series A Preferred Stock so converted are surrendered to
the Corporation or the holder of record of such shares notifies the Corporation that such
certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and such holder executes an agreement to
indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates, in

to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid. The person or persons entitled to receive the
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion pursuant to this Section 3 shall be
treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock as of the
effective date of such conversion. If the conversion is in connection with an underwritten
offering of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended or any Sale
Transaction, the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering Series A Preferred Stock
for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of securities

first issued (the "Purchase Date"), any Additional Stock (as defined below) without
consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Serics A Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock, the Series A Conversion Price in
effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall be reduced, concurrently with such issuance
or sale, to a price determined by multiplying the Series A Conversion Price by a fraction, the
numcrator of which shall be the sum of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to such issue or sale and (y) the number of shares of Common Stock that the
aggregate consideration actually received by the Corporation for such Additional Stock so issued
would purchase at the Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or
sale, and the denominator of which shall be equal to the sum of (x) the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale and (y) the number of shares
of Additional Stock (calculated on an as converted to Common Stock basis) so issued or sold.
For the purpose of the above calculation, the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to such issue or sale shall be calculated as if all shares of Series A Preferred
Stock and all vested securities that are then exercisable for or convertible into sharcs of Common
Stock had been fully exercised for or converted into shares of Common Stock as of such time.

(B) Except to the limited extent provided for in Sections
3(dXiXE)(3) and (E)(4), no adjustment of the Series A Conversion Price pursuant to this Section
3(d) shall have the effect of increasing the Series A Conversion Price above the Series A
Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment.

cash. the consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor.

which the readjustment relates) between the Purchase Date and such readjustment
date. In the event of any adjustment to the Series A Conversion Price as a result
of the issuance of Options or Convertible Securities pursuant to this Section 3(d).
