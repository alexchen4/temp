amounts to which they shall be entitled as provided in Sections 2(a) through 2(d), the remaining
assets and funds of the Corporation legally available for distribution to stockholders shall be
distributed among the holders of the outstanding Series D Preferred Stock and the outstanding
Common Stock in proportion to the respective Catch Up Ratio (as defined below) for the Series
D Preferred Stock and Common Stock, respectively, until such time as the distribution to holders
of Series D Preferred Stock and Common Stock pursuant to this Section 2(e) satisfies the Catch
Up Threshold (as defined below). The “Catch Up Ratio” is (i) for the Series D Preferred Stock,
at the time of calculation, the percentage ownership (calculated to the nearest 0.001%) that the
Series D Preferred Stock represents on an as-converted basis of the Corporation’s Fully Diluted
Shares (as defined below) and (ii) for the Common Stock at the time of calculation, one (1)
minus the percentage ownership (calculated to the nearest 0.001%) that the Series D Preferred
Stock represents on an as-converted basis of the Corporation’s Fully Diluted Shares. For
purposes of this Section 2(e), the “Common Stock Shares” equals the sum of (i) all issued and
outstanding Common Stock, (ii) all Common Stock reserved for issuance but unissued pursuant
to the Corporation’s 2000 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the “Option Plan”), and (iii) all
outstanding options to purchase Common Stock on an as-exercised basis. For purposes of this
Section 2(e), the “Fully Diluted Shares” equals the sum of (i) the Common Stock Shares, (ii) all
outstanding warrants and other convertible securities to purchase Common Stock on an as-
exercised and as-converted basis, and (iii) all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock on an as-
converted basis. The “Catch Up Threshold” is satisfied when (i) the aggregate amount
distributed to the holders of Common Stock pursuant to this Section 2(e) divided by (ii) the
aggregate amount distributed to the holders of Preferred Stock and Common Stock pursuant to
Sections 2(a) through 2(e) is equal to amount determined by dividing (i) Common Stock Shares
by (11) the Fully Diluted Shares.

(p After payment has been made to the holders of the Preferred Stock and Common
Stock of the full amounts t¢ ich-they-shall_be entitled as provided above in Sections 2(a)
through 2(e), the entire remaining assets and funds-of the Corporation legally available for
distribution to stockholders shall be-distributed ratably among the holders of the Series D
Preferred Stock, the Series C Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock, the Series A
Preferred Stock and Common Stock in proportion to the number of shares of Common Stock
held by them or into which such Preferred Stock may be converted.

(g) A consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into any other corporation or
corporations, or a sale, conveyance or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Corporation, including without limitation intangible assets, or the effectuation by the Corporation
of a transaction or series of related transactions in which more than 50% of the voting power of
the Corporation is disposed of shall be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of
the Corporation within the meaning of this Section 2, unless the holders of at least 60% of the
then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock voting on an as-converted basis and together as a
single class elect otherwise by giving notice to the Corporation at least five (5) days before the
effective date of such event (a “Liquidation Event”). A consolidation or merger of the
Corporation with or into any other corporation or corporations or a sale, conveyance or
disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation where the Corporation is the
surviving entity or in which more than 50% of the voting power of the Corporation is not
disposed of, shall not be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation
within the meaning of this Section 2.

The holders of Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as follows (the “Conversion

Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option
of the holder thereof, at any time and from time to time, into such number of fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Original Issue Price by
the Conversion Price in effect at the time of conversion for a share of such series of Preferred
Stock. The Original Issue Price per share of Series A Preferred Stock is $1.0008. The Original
Issue Price per share of Series B Preferred Stock is $0.5004. The Original Issue Price per share
of Series C Preferred Stock is $0.1561. The Original Issue Price per share of Series D Preferred
Stock is $1.251. The Original Issue Price per share of Series E Preferred Stock is $2.35566. The
Conversion Price at which shares of Common Stock shall be deliverable upon conversion of
Series A Preferred Stock without the payment of additional consideration by the holder thereof
shall be $1.251 per share, subject to adjustment from time to time as provided below. The
Conversion Price at which shares of Common Stock shall be deliverable upon conversion of
Series B Preferred Stock without the payment of additional consideration by the holder thereof
shall be $1.251 per share, subject to adjustment from time to time as provided below. The
Conversion Price at which shares of Common Stock shall be deliverable upon conversion of
Series C Preferred Stock without the payment of additional consideration by the holder thereof
shall be $1.251 per share, subject to adjustment from time to time as provided below. The
Conversion Price at which shares of Common Stock shall be deliverable upon conversion of

-6-
LIBC/2747916.7
Series D Preferred Stock without the payment of additional consideration by the holder thereof
shall be $1.251 per share, subject to adjustment from time to time provided below. The
Conversion Price at which shares of Common Stock shall be deliverable upon conversion of
Series E Preferred Stock without the payment of additional consideration by the holder thereof
shall be $2.35566 per share, subject to adjustment from time to time provided below.

In the event of a liquidation of the Corporation, the Conversion Rights shall terminate at
the close of business on the first full day preceding the date fixed for the payment of any amounts
distributable on liquidation to the holders of Preferred Stock.

(b) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon
conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would
otherwise be entitled, the Corporation at its election shall either (i) pay cash equal to the product
(calculated to the nearest $0.0001) of such fraction and the then effective Conversion Price, or
(ii) issue one whole share of Common Stock for each fractional share to which the holder would
otherwise be entitled.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion.

(i) In order for a holder of Preferred Stock to convert shares of Preferred
Stock into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the certificate or
certificates for such shares of Preferred Stock (or, if such registered holder alleges that
such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and
agreement reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against
any claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft
or destruction of such certificate), at the office of the transfer agent for the Preferred
Stock (or at the principal office of the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own
transfer agent), together with written notice that such holder elects to convert all or any
number of the shares of the Preferred Stock represented by such certificate or certificates.
Such notice shall state such holder’s name or the names of the nominees in which such
holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued. If
required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or
accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the
Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or his or its attorney duly authorized
in writing. The date of receipt of such certificates (or affidavits) and notice by the
transfer agent (or by the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent)
shall be the conversion date (“Conversion Date”). The Corporation shall, as soon as
practicable after the Conversion Date, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of
Preferred Stock, or to his or its nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of
shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled, together with cash in lieu
of any fraction of a share.

(ii) | The Corporation shall at all times when the Preferred Stock shall be
outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued stock, for the
purpose of effecting the conversion of the Preferred Stock, such number of its duly
authorized shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the

-7.
LIBC/2747916.7
conversion of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock. Before taking any action which
would cause an adjustment reducing the Conversion Price below the then par value of the
shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock, the
Corporation will take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be
necessary in order that the Corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion Price.

(iii) On the Conversion Date, all shares of Preferred Stock which shall have
been surrendered for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be
outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares, including the rights, if any, to
receive notices and to vote, shall immediately cease and terminate on the Conversion
Date, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in
exchange therefor.

(iv) If the conversion is in connection with an underwritten offering of
securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the conversion
may at the option of any holder tendering Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned
upon the closing with the underwriter of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering, in
which event the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such
conversion of Preferred Stock shal! not be deemed to have converted such Preferred
Stock until immediately prior to the closing of the sale of securities.

(d) Adjustments to Conversion Price for Diluting Issues.

(i) Special Definitions. For purposes of this Section 3(d), the following
definitions shall apply:

(A) “Option” shall mean rights, options or warrants to subscribe
for, purchase or otherwise acquire Common Stock or Convertible Securities.

(determined pursuant to Section 3(d)(v)) for an Additional Share of Common Stock
issued or deemed to be issued by the Corporation is less than the applicable Conversion
Price in effect on the date of, and immediately prior to, the issue of such Additional

Shares.

(iii) Issue of Securities Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock.
If the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall
issue any Options or Convertible Securities for Additional Shares of Common Stock or
shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to
receive any such Options or Convertible Securities for Additional Shares of Common
Stock, then the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set forth in the
instrument relating thereto without regard to any provision contained therein for a
subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or, in
the case of Convertible Securities and Options therefor, the conversion or exchange of
such Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to be Additional Shares of Common Stock
issued as of the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as
of the close of business on such record date, provided that Additional Shares of Common
Stock shall not be deemed to have been issued unless the consideration per share
(determined pursuant to Section 3(d)(v) hereof) of such Additional Shares of Common
Stock would be less than the applicable Conversion Price in effect on the date of and
immediately prior to such issue, or such record date, as the case may be, and provided
further that in any such case in which Additional Shares of Common Stock are deemed to
be issued:

(A) No further adjustment in the Conversion Price shall be
made upon the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities or shares of Common
Stock upon the exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities;

(B) ‘If such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms
provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any increase in the
consideration payable to the Corporation, or decrease in the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, the
Conversion Price computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon the
occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustment
based thereon, shall, upon any such increase or decrease becoming effective, be
recomputed to reflect such increase or decrease insofar as it affects such Options
or the rights of conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities;

(C) upon the expiration of any such Options or any rights of
conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have
been exercised, the Conversion Price computed upon the original issue thereof (or
upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent
adjustments based thereon, shall, upon such expiration, be recomputed as if;

) in the case of Convertible Securities or Options for
Common Stock, only the Additional Shares of Common Stock issued were
shares of Common Stock, if any, actually issued upon the exercise of such
Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities and
the consideration received therefor was the consideration actually received
by the Corporation for the issue of all such Options, whether or not

-10-
LIBC/2747916.7
exercised, plus the consideration actually received by the Corporation
upon such exercise, or for the issue of all such Convertible Securities
which were actually converted or exchanged, plus the additional
consideration, if any, actually received by the Corporation upon such
conversion or exchange, and

(I) in the case of Options for Convertible Securities,
only the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise
thereof were issued at the time of issue of such Options, and the
consideration received by the Corporation for the Additional Shares of
Common Stock deemed to have been then issued was the consideration
actually received by the Corporation for the issue of all such Options,
whether or not exercised, plus the consideration deemed to have been
received by the Corporation upon the issue of the Convertible Securities
with respect to which such Options were actually exercised; and

(D) if such record date shall have been fixed and such Options
or Convertible Securities are not issued on the date fixed therefor, the adjustments
previously made in the Conversion Price which became effective on such record
date shall be cancelled as of the close of business on such record date, and
thereafter the Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this Section 3(d)(iii)
as of the actual date of their issuance.

(iv) Adjustment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional Shares of
Common Stock. Subject to the provisions of Section 3(d)(ii) above, in the event the
Corporation shall at any time after the Original Issue Date issue Additional Shares of
Common Stock (including Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued
pursuant to. Section on 3(d}{iii), but-excluding shares issued as a dividend or distribution as
provided i in Section on 3(f)-or upon a stock split or combination as provided in Section 3(e)),
_Without-consideration-oF ¥ for a consideration | per share less than a Conversion Price in
effect on the-date of and immediately” prior to such issue, then and in such event, such
“Conversion Price shall ‘be reduced, concurrently with such issue to a price (calculated to

a the nearest. $0.0001) determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, (x)

the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to such issue plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the
aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for the total number of Additional
Shares of Common Stock so issued would purchase at such Conversion Price, and (y) the
denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to such issue plus the number of such Additional Shares of Common
Stock so issued; provided that for the purposes of this Section 3(d)(iv), all shares of
Common Stock issuable upon exercise, conversion or exchange of outstanding Options or
Convertible Securities, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be outstanding, and
immediately after any Additional Shares of Common Stock shall be deemed issued
pursuant to Section 3(d){iii) above, such Additional Shares of Common Stock shall be
deemed to be outstanding. The provision of this Section 3(d)(iv) shall be applied

-l]-

LIBC/2747916.7
separately to the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock, the
Series C Preferred Stock, the Series D Preferred Stock and the Series E Preferred Stock.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the applicable Conversion Price shall not be so
reduced at such time if the amount of such reduction would be an amount less than
$.0001, but any such amount shall be carried forward and reduction with respect thereto
shall be made at the time of and together with any subsequent reduction which, together
with such amount and any other amount or amounts so carried forward, shall aggregate
$.0001 or more.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this Section 3(d), the
consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional Shares of
Common Stock shall be computed as follows:

(A) Cash and Property. Such consideration shall:

() insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
aggregate of cash received by the Corporation, excluding amounts paid or
payable for accrued interest or accrued dividends;

(I) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair market value thereof at the time of such issue, as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors; and

(i) iin the event Additional Shares of Common Stock
are issued together with other shares or securities or other assets of the
Corporation for consideration which covers both, be the proportion of such
consideration so received, computed as provided in clauses (I) and (I)
above, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(B) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per
share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock
deemed to have been issued pursuant to Section 3(d)(iii), relating to Options and
Convertible Securities, shall be determined by dividing:

(x) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by
the Corporation as consideration for the issue of
such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the
minimum aggregate amount of additional
consideration (as set forth in the instruments
relating thereto, without regard to any provision
contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of
such consideration) payable to the Corporation upon
the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the
case of Options for Convertible Securities, the

-12-
LIBC/2747916.7
exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities
and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, by

(y) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock
(as set forth in the instruments relating thereto,
without regard to any provision contained therein
for a subsequent adjustment of such number)
issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities.

(e) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If the Corporation shall at any

time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date effect a subdivision of the outstanding
Common Stock, the Conversion Price then in effect immediately before that subdivision shall be
proportionately decreased. If the Corporation shall at any time or from time to time after the
Original Issue Date combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price then
in effect immediately before the combination shall be proportionately increased. Any adjustment
under this Section 3(c) shall become effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision
or combination becomes effective.

(f) Adjustment for Certain Dividends and Distributions. In the event the Corporation

at any time, or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall make or issue, or fix a record
date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other
distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock, then and in each such event the
Conversion Price then in effect shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance or, in the event
such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, by
multiplying the Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction:

(x) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the
close of business on such record date, and

(y) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the
close of business on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution;

provided, however, if such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend is not fully paid
or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the Conversion Price shall be
recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record date and thereafter the
Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this Section 3(f) as of the time of actual payment
of such dividends or distributions.

(g) Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. In the event the Corporation

at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall make or issue, or fix a record

-13-
LIBC/2747916.7
date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other
distribution payable in securities of the Corporation other than shares of Common Stock (other
than as otherwise adjusted in this Section 3), then and in each such event provision shall be made
so that the holders of Preferred Stock shall receive upon conversion thereof in addition to the
number of shares of Common Stock receivable thereupon, the amount of securities of the
Corporation that they would have received had their Preferred Stock been converted into
Common Stock on the date of such event and had thereafter, during the period from the date of
such event to and including the Conversion Date, retained such securities receivable by them as
aforesaid during such period giving application to all adjustments called for during such period
(subject to all other adjustments called for during such period under this Section 3), under this
paragraph with respect to the nghts of the holders of Preferred Stock.

(h) Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange, or Substitution. If the Common Stock
issuable upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or a different

number of shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization,
reclassification, or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares provided for
above), the Conversion Price then in effect shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such
reorganization or reclassification, be proportionately adjusted such that the Preferred Stock shall
be convertible into, in licu of the number of shares of Common Stock which the holders would
otherwise have been entitled to receive, a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock
equivalent to the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been subject to receipt by
the holders upon conversion of the Preferred Stock immediately before that change.

(i) Adjustment for Merger or Reorganization or Sale of Assets. Subject to Section 2,

in case of any consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into another corporation or the
sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation to another corporation, each share
of Preferred Stock shall thereafter be convertible into the kind and amount of shares of stock or
other securities or property to which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the
Corporation deliverable upon conversion of such Preferred Stock would have been entitled upon
such consolidation, merger or sale; and, in such case, appropriate adjustment (as determined in
good faith by the Board of Directors) shall be made in the application of the provisions set forth
in this Section 3 with respect to the rights and interest thereafter of the holders of Preferred
Stock, to the end that the provisions set forth in this Section 3 (including provisions with respect
to changes in and other adjustments of the Conversion Price) shall thereafter be applicable, as
nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any shares of stock or other property thereafter
deliverable upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock.

(j) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment of the
Conversion Price pursuant to this Section3, the Corporation at its expense shall promptly
compute such adjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to each holder of
Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment and showing in detail the facts upon
which such adjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of
any holder of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a similar certificate
setting forth (i) such adjustments, (ii) the Conversion Price then in effect, and (iii) the number of
shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which then would be received
upon the conversion of Preferred Stock.

-14-
LIBC/2747916.7
(k) Notices of Record Date. In the event of any taking by the Corporation of a record
of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof who
are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend) or other distribution, the
Corporation shall mail to each holder of Preferred Stock at least ten (10) days prior to the date
specified therein, a notice specifying the date on which any such record is to be taken of the
purpose of such dividend or distribution.

(1) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Section 3 to be given to the
holders of shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed given if deposited in the United States mail,
postage prepaid, and addressed to each holder of record at its address appearing on the books of
the Corporation.

4. Mandatory Conversion.

(a) | Mandatory Conversion. All holders of shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding
shall convert their shares of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, at the then effective
conversion rate pursuant to Section 3, upon (i) the agreement of the holders of at least 60% of the
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together and on an as-converted basis, that all of
the Preferred Stock shall be converted into shares of Common Stock, or (ii) upon the closing of
the sale of shares of Common Stock in a firm commitment underwritten public offering of the
Common Stock of the Corporation pursuant to an effective registration statement under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, where the gross proceeds to the Corporation are in excess of
$50,000,000 and the price per share is at least $7.06698 subject to adjustment to reflect stock
splits, stock dividends, reverse stock splits, recapitalizations, combinations or other similar

events (a “Public Offering”).

(b) Procedure. In the event of a mandatory conversion pursuant to Section 4, the
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically without any further action
by the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates representing such shares are
surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent, and provided further that the Corporation
shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon
such automatic conversion unless the certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are
either delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent as provided above, or the holder notifies
the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and
executes an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss
incurred by it in connection with such certificates. Such conversion shall be deemed to have
been made on the date of closing of the offering or the effective date of the applicable vote or
written consent, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of
such shares of Common Stock on such date. On the date fixed for conversion, all rights with
respect to the Preferred Stock so converted, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and
vote, will terminate, except only the rights of the holders thereof, upon surrender of their
certificate or certificates therefor, to receive certificates for the number of shares of Common
Stock into which such Preferred Stock has been converted (and cash, if any, with respect to any
fraction of a share as provided in Section 3(b)). Lf so required by the Corporation, certificates
surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by written instrument or

-]5-
LIBC/2747916.7
instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly authorized in wnting. As
soon as practicable after the date of such mandatory conversion and the surrender of the
certificate or certificates for Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall cause to be issued and
delivered to such holder a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common
Stock issuable on such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof and cash, if any, as
provided in Section 3(b) in respect of any fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise
issuable upon such conversion.

(c) Retirement _and Cancellation of Shares. All certificates evidencing shares of
Preferred Stock which are required to be surrendered for conversion in accordance with the
provisions hereof shall, from and after the date such certificates are so required to be surrendered,
be deemed to have been retired and cancelled and the shares of Preferred Stock represented
thereby converted into Common Stock for all purposes, notwithstanding the failure of the holder
or holders thereof to surrender such certificates on or prior to such date.

4.A ~ Special Mandatory Conversion. -
4

_ In the event that any holder of shat of Preferred Stock does not participate in a
Qualified~Financing (as_defined- below) by purchasing in the aggregate, in such Qualified
Financing and within the time period specified by the Corporation (provided that the Corporation
has given such holder at least ten (10) business days written notice of the Qualified Financing),
such holder’s Pro Rata Amount (as defined below), then each share of Preferred Stock held by
such holder shall automatically, and without any further action on the part of such holder, be
converted on a share-for-share basis into shares of a newly created series of Preferred Stock
(having such number of shares as the Board of Directors may by resolution fix), which newly
created series shall be identical in all respects to the relevant series of Preferred Stock being
converted pursuant to this Section 4A, except that the Conversion Price of such series in effect
immediately prior to the consummation of the Qualified Financing shall be fixed and shall not be
subject to any further adjustment under Section 3(d)(iv) above and except that the terms of the
new series my vary from the terms of the relevant series of Preferred Stock being converted
pursuant to this Section 4A to the extent deemed necessary by the Board of Directors to
accomplish the intent of this Section (such new series of Preferred Stock, the “New Preferred
Stock”). The Board of Directors shall take all necessary actions to designate any such series of
New Preferred Stock. For purposes of determining the number of Offered Securities a holder of
Preferred Stock has purchased in a Qualified Financing, all Offered Securities purchased by
Affiliates of such holder shall be aggregated with the Offered Securities purchased by such
holder (provided that no shares or securities shall be attributed to more than one entity or person
within any such group of affiliated entities or persons). Upon such conversion (a “Special
Mandatory Conversion”), any shares of Preferred Stock so converted shall be cancelled and not
subject to reissuance.

Upon a Special Mandatory Conversion, each holder of shares of Preferred Stock
converted pursuant to Section 4A shall surrender his, her or its certificate or certificates for all
such shares to the Corporation at the place designated in such notice, and shall thereafter receive
certificates for the number of shares of New Preferred Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to this Section 4A. All rights with respect to the Preferred Stock converted pursuant to

-16-
LIBC/2747916.7
Section 4A, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and vote (other than as a holder of
New Preferred Stock), will terminate, except only the rights of the holders thereof, upon
surrender of their certificate or certificates therefor, to receive certificates for the number of
shares of New Preferred Stock into which such Preferred Stock has been converted, and payment
of any declared but unpaid dividends thereon. If so required by the Corporation, certificates
surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by written instrument or
instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered
holder or by his, her or its attorney duly authorized in writing. As soon as practicable after the
Special Mandatory Conversion and the surrender of the certificate or certificates for Preferred
Stock so converted, the Corporation shall cause to be issued and delivered to such holder, or on
his, her or its written order, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of New Preferred
Stock issuable on such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof.

All certificates evidencing shares of Preferred Stock which are required to be surrendered
for conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof shall, from and after the time of the
Special Mandatory Conversion, be deemed to have been retired and cancelled, and the shares of
Preferred Stock converted pursuant to Section 4A represented thereby shall, from and after the
time of the Special Mandatory Conversion, be deemed to have been converted into New
Preferred Stock for all purposes, notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to
surrender such certificates on or prior to such date. The Corporation may thereafter take such
appropriate action (without the need for stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the
authorized number of shares of Preferred Stock accordingly.

For purposes of this Section 4A, the following definitions shall apply:

of (a) a number of Offered Securities calculated by multiplying the aggregate number of Offered
Securities by a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the number of shares of outstanding
Common Stock owned by such holder, and the denominator of which is equal to the aggregate
number of shares of Common Stock owned by all holders of outstanding shares of Preferred
Stock (for the purpose of this definition, treating all shares of Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of Options outstanding immediately prior to such Qualified Financing or upon
conversion of Convertible Securities outstanding immediately prior to such Qualified Financing
as outstanding), or (b) the maximum number of Offered Securities that such holder is permitted

-17-
LIBC/2747916.7

limitations established by the Board of Directors and applied on a pro rata basis to all holders of
Preferred Stock.

-21-
LIBC/2747916.7
