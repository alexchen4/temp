4, Optional Conversion.

The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as follows (the
“Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be
convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time and from time to time, and without
the payment of additional consideration by the holder thereof, into such number of fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing $0.362 by the Series A
Conversion Price (as defined below) in effect at the time of conversion. The “Series A
Conversion Price’ shal] initially be equal to the Series A Original Issue Price. Such initial
Series A Conversion Price, and the rate at which shares of Series A Preferred Stock may be
converted into shares of Common Stock, shall be subject to adjustment as provided below.

In the event of a notice of redemption of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant
to Subsection 6 hereof, the Conversion Rights of the shares designated for redemption shall
terminate at the close of business on the last full day preceding the date fixed for redemption,
unless the redemption price is not paid on such redemption date, in which case the Conversion
Rights for such shares shali continue until such price is paid in full. In the event of a liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation or a Deemed Liquidation Event, the Conversion
Rights shall terminate at the close of business on the last full day preceding the date fixed for the
payment of any such amounts distributable on such event to the holders of Series A Preferred
Stock.

(bo) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued
upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the
holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction
multiplied by the fair market value of a share of Cornmon Stock as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors of the Corporation. Whether or not fractional shares would be issuable
upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Series A
Preferred Stock the holder is at the time converting into Common Stock and the aggregate
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion.

USIDOCS $535894v6
w@ In order for a holder of Series A Preferred Stock to voluntarily
convert shares of Series A Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall
surrender the certificate or certificates for such shares of Series A Preferred Stock (or, if such
registered holder alleges that such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate
affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation
against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft
or destruction of such certificate), at the office of the transfer agent for the Series A Preferred
Stock (or at the principal office of the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer
agent), together with written notice that such holder elects to convert all or any number of the
shares of the Series A Preferred Stock represented by such certificate or certificates and, if
applicable, any event on which such conversion is contingent. Such notice shall state such
holder’s name or the names of the nominees in which such holder wishes the certificate or
certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued. If required by the Corporation, certificates
surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or
insuuments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered
holder or his, her or its attomey duly authorized in writing. The close of business on the date of
receipt by the transfer agent of such certificates (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement) and
notice (or by the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent) shall be the time
of conversion (the “Conversion Time’), and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of the shares represented by such certificate shall be deemed to be outstanding of
record as of such date. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after the Conversion Time,
issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Series A Preferred Stock, or to his, her or its
nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such
holder shall be entitled, together with cash in lieu of any fraction of a share.

(ii) | The Corporation shall at all times when the Series A Preferred
Stock shal] be outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued stock,
for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, such number of its
duly authorized shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding Series A Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all then outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall take such
corporate action as may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common
Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including, without
limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary
amendment to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. Before taking any action
which would cause an adjustment reducing the Series A Conversion Price below the then par
value of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock,
the Corporation will take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be
necessary in order that the Corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock at such adjusted Series A Conversion Price.

(iii) All shares of Series A Preferred Stock which shall have been
surrendered for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and
all rights with respect to such shares, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and to vote,
shall immediately cease and terminate at the Conversion Time, except only the right of the
holders thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor and to receive payment

9

USIDOCS 5535394v6
of any dividends declared but unpaid thereon. Any shares of Series A Preferred Stack so
converted shall be retired and cancelled and shall not be reissued as shares of such series, and the
Corporation (without the need for stockholder action) may from time to time take such
appropriate action as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Series A
Preferred Stock accordingly.

(iv) Upon any such conversion, no adjustment to the Series A
Conversion Price shall be made for any declared but unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred
Stock surrendered for conversion or on the Common Stock delivered upon conversion.

(v) The Corporation shal! pay any and all issue and other similar taxes
that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon
conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to this Subsection 4. The Corporation
shall not, however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer
involved in the issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in
which the shares of Series A Preferred Stock so converted were registered, and no such issuance
or delivery shall be made unless and until the person or entity requesting such issuance has paid
to the Corporation the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the
Corporation, that such tax has been paid.

(d) Adjustments to Series A Conversjon Price for Diluting Issues.

(i) Special Definitions. For purposes of this Subsection4, the
following definitions shall apply:

pursuant to the Voting Agreement.

(ii) No Adjustment of Series A Conversion Price. No adjustment in
the Series A Conversion Price shall be made as the result of the issuance of Additional Shares of
Common Stock if: (a) the consideration per share (determined pursuant to Subsection 4(d\v))
for such Additional Shares of Common Stock issued or deemed to be issued by the Corporation
is equal to or greater than the applicable Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to
the issuance or deemed issuance of such Additional Shares of Common Stock, or (b) prior to
such issuance or deemed issuance, the Corporation receives written notice from the holders of at
least sixty-nine percent (69%) of the then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock
agreeing that no such adjustment shall be made as the result of the issuance or deemed issuance
of such Additional Shares of Common Stock.

(iii) | Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock.

(A) _ If the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the
Series A Original Issue Date shall issue any Options or Convertible Securities (excluding
Options or Convertible Securities which, upon exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, would
entitle the holder thereof to receive Exempted Securities) or shall fix a record date for the
determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive any such Options or
Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set forth in
the instrument relating thereto, assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to exercisability,
convertibility or exchangeability but without regard to any provision contained therein for a
subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case
of Convertible Securities and Options therefor, the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, shall be deemed to be Additional Shares of Common Stock issued as of the time of
such issue or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such
record date.

(B) If the terms of any Option or Convertible Security, the
issuance of which resulted in an adjustment to the Series A Conversion Price pursuant to the
terms of Subsection 4(d)(iv) below, are revised (either automatically pursuant to the provisions
contained therein or as a result of an amendment to such terms) to provide for either (1) any

12

USIDOCS 553536 v6
increase or decrease in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise,
conversion or exchange of any such Option or Convertible Security or (2) any increase or
decrease in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion or
exchange, then, effective upon such increase or decrease becoming effective, the Series A
Conversion Price computed upon the original issue of such Option or Convertible Security (or
upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto) shall be readjusted to such Series A
Conversion Price as would have obtained had such revised terms been in effect upon the original
date of issuance of such Option or Convertible Security. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
adjustment pursuant to this clause (B) shall have the effect of increasing the Series A Conversion
Price to an amount which exceeds the lower of (i) the Series A Conversion Price on the original
adjustment date, or (ii) the Series A Conversion Price that would have resulted from any
issuances of Additional Shares of Common Stock between the original adjustment date and such
readjustment date.

(C) If the terms of any Option or Convertible Security
(excluding Options or Convertible Securities which, upon exercise, conversion or exchange
thereof, would entitle the holder thereof to receive Exempted Securities), the issuance of which
did not result in an adjustment to the Series A Conversion Price pursuant to the terms of
Subsection 4(d)(iv) below (either because the consideration per share (determined pursuant to
Subsection 4(d)(y) hereof) of the Additional Shares of Common Stock subject thereto was equal
to or greater than the Scries A Conversion Price then in effect, or because such Option or
Convertible Security was issued before the Series A Original Issue Date), are revised after the
Series A Original Issue Date (either automatically pursuant to the provisions contained therein or
as a result of an amendment to such terms) to provide for either (1) any increase or decrease in
the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of
any such Option or Convertible Security or (2) any increase or decrease in the consideration
payable to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion or exchange, then such Option or
Convertible Security, as so amended, and the Additional Shares of Common Stock subject
thereto (determined in the manner provided in Subsection 4(d)(iii(A) above) shall be deemed to
have been issued effective upon such increase or decrease becoming effective.

(D) Upon the expiration or termination of any unexercised
Option or unconverted or unexchanged Convertible Security which resulted (either upon its
original issuance or upon 4 revision of its terms) in an adjustment to the Series A Conversion
Price pursuant to the terms of Subsection 4(dXiv) below, the Series A Conversion Price shall be
readjusted to such Series A Conversion Price as would have obtained had such Option or
Convertible Security never been issued.

(iv) Adjustment of Series Conversion Pric: n_Issuance_of
Additional Shares of Common Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the

Series A Original Issue Date issue Additional Shares of Common Stock (including Additional
Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to Subsection 4(dWiii)),, without
consideration or for a consideration per share less than the applicable Series A Conversion Price~
“Tir effect immediately prior to such issue, then the Series A Conversion Price shall be reduced,
concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent)
determined in accordance with the following formula:

13

USIDOCS 55358945
CP, =CP, * (A+B)+(A+C)
For purposes of the foregoing formula, the following definitions shall apply:

(A) CP, shall mean the Series A Conversion Price in effect
immediately after such issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock;

(B) CP, shall mean the Series A Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock;

(C) “A” shall mean the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding and deemed outstanding immediately prior to such issue of Additional Shares of
Common Stock treating for this purpose as outstanding all shares of Common Stock: (i) issuable
upon exercise of Options outstanding immediately prior to such issue and (ii) issuable upon
conversion of Convertible Securities (including the Series A Preferred Stock) outstanding
immediately prior to such issue);

(D) ‘“B” shall mean the number of shares of Common Stock
that would have been issued if such Additional Shares of Common Stock had been issued at a
price per share equal to CP, (determined by dividing the aggregate consideration received by the
Corporation in respect of such issue by CP)); and

(E) “C” shall mean the number of such Additional Shares of
Common Stock issued in such transaction.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this
Subsection 4d), the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional
Shares of Common Stock shall be computed as follows:

(A)  Cashand Property: Such consideration shall:
(1) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the

aggregate amount of cash received by the
Corporation, excluding amounts paid or payable for
accrued interest;

(II) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair market value thereof at the
time of such issue, as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors of the Corporation; and

(Ill) in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock
are issued together with other shares or securities or
other assets of the Corporation for consideration
which covers both, be the proportion of such
consideration so received, computed as provided in
clauses (1) and (II) above, as determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

14

USIDOCS 5535864 v6
(B) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per
share reccived by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been

issued pursuant to Subsection 4(d)/(iii), relating to Options and Convertible Securities, shall be
determined by dividing

(1) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by
the Corporation as consideration for the issue of
such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the
minimum aggregate amount of additional
consideration (as set forth in the instruments
relating thereto, without regard to any provision
contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of
such consideration) payable to the Corporation upon
the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the
case of Options for Convertible Securities, the
exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities
and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, by

(I) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock
(as set forth in the instruments relating thereto,
without regard to any provision contained therein
for a subsequent adjustment of such number)
issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities.

(vi) Multiple Closing Dates. In the event the Corporation shall issue on
more than one date Additional Shares of Common Stock that are a part of one transaction or a
series of related transactions and that would result in an adjustment to the Series A Conversion
Price pursuant to the terms of Subsection 4(d)(iv) above, and such issuance dates occur within a
period of no more than 120 days from the first such issuance to the final such issuance, then,
upon the final such issuance, the Series A Conversion Price shall be readjusted to give effect to
all such issuances as if they occurred on the date of the first such issuance (and without
additional giving effect to any adjustments as a result of any subsequent issuances within such
period).

(e) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If the Corporation shall at

any time or from time to time after the Series A Original Issue Date effect a subdivision of the
outstanding Common Stock without a comparable subdivision of the Series A Preferred Stock or
combine the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock without a comparable combination
of the Common Stock, the Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately before that
subdivision or combination shal] be proportionately decreased so that the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be increased in
proportion to such increase in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding or
such decrease in the aggregate number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, as the case may be.

15

USIDOCS 55358946
If the Corporation shall at any time or from time to time after the Series A Original Issue Date
combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock without a comparable combination of the
Series A Preferred Stock or effect a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred
Stock without a comparable subdivision of the Common Stock, the Series A Conversion Price in
effect immediately before the combination or subdivision shall be proportionately increased so
that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series
shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in the aggregate number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding or such decrease in the aggregate number of shares of Series A Preferred
Stock, as the case may be. Any adjustment under this subsection shal] become effective at the
close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective.

63) Adjustment_for Certain Dividends and Distributions. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Series A Original Issue Date shall make or
issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive,
a dividend or other distribution payable on the Common Stock in additional shares of Common
Stock, then and in each such event the Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately before
such event shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance or, in the event such a record date
shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, by multiplying the Series A
Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction:

(1) ‘the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of
business on such record date, and

(2) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of
business on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of
such dividend or distribution;

provided, however, that if such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend is not fully
paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the Series A Conversion
Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record date and
thereafter the Series A Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this subsection as of the
time of actual payment of such dividends or distributions; and provided further, however, that no
such adjustment shall be made if the holders of Series A Preferred Stock simultaneously receive
(i) a dividend or other distribution of shares of Comunon Stock in a number equal to the number
of shares of Common Stock as they would have received if all outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event or (ii) a
dividend or other distribution of shares of Series A Preferred Stock which are convertible, as of
the date of such event, into such number of shares of Common Stock as is equal to the number of
additional shares of Common Stock being issued with respect to each share of Common Stock in
such dividend or distribution.

(g) Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Series A Original Issue Date shall make or
issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of capital stock of the Corporation
entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the Corporation (other

16

USIDOCS $53489456
than a distribution of shares of Common Stock in respect of outstanding shares of Common
Stock) or in other property and the provisions of Subsection 1 do not apply to such dividend or
distribution, then and in each such event the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall receive,
simultaneously with the distribution to the holders of such capital stock, a dividend or other
distribution of such securities or other property in an amount equal to the amount of such
securities or other property as they would have received if all outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event.

(h) Adjustment for Merger or Reorganization, etc. Subject to the provisions
of Subsection 2(c), if there shall occur any reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
consolidation or merger involving the Corporation in which the Common Stock (but not the
Series A Preferred Stock) is converted into or exchanged for securities, cash or other property
(other than a transaction covered by Subsections (e), (f) or (g) of this Subsection 4), then,
following any such reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger,
each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall thereafter be convertible in lieu of the Common
Stock into which it was convertible prior to such event into the kind and amount of securities,
cash or other property which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the
Corporation issuable upon conversion of one share of Series A Preferred Stock immediately
prior to such reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger would
have been entitled to receive pursuant to such transaction; and, in such case, appropriate
adjustment (as determined in gaod faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation) shall be
made in the application of the provisions in this Subsection 4 with respect to the rights and
interests thereafter of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, to the end that the provisions
set forth in this Subsection4 (including provisions with respect to changes in and other
adjustments of the Series A Conversion Price) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as
reasonably may be, in relation to any securities or other property thereafter deliverable upon the
conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock.

(i) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Series A Conversion Price pursuant to this Subsection 4, the Corporation at
its expense shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable but in any event not later than 30 days
thereafter, compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and
furnish to each holder of Series A Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or
readjustment (including the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property into which the
Series A Preferred Stock is convertible) and showing in detail the facts upon which such
adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the written request at any time of any holder of Series A Preferred Stock (but in
any event not later than 30 days thereafter), furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a
certificate setting forth (i) the Series A Conversion Price then in effect, and (ii) the number of
shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other securities, cash or property which then
would be received upon the conversion of Series A Preferred Stock.

(j) Notice of Record Date. In the event:

(i) the Corporation shall take a record of the holders of its Common
Stock (or other stock or securities at the time issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred
Stock) for the purpose of entitling or enabling them to receive any dividend or other distribution,

17

USIDOCS 5535894v6
or to reccive any right to subscribe for or purchase any shares of stock of any class or any other
securities, or to receive any other right; or

(ii) of any capital reorganization of the Corporation, any
reclassification of the Common Stock of the Corporation, or any Deemed Liquidation Event; or

(ii) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-
up of the Corporation,

then, and in each such case, the Corporation will send or cause to be sent to the holders of the
Series A Preferred Stock a notice specifying, as the case may be, (i) the record date for such
dividend, distribution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or
right, or (ii) the effective date on which such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation,
merger, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is proposed to take place, and the time, if
any is to be fixed, as of which the holders of record of Common Stock (or such other stock or
securitics at the time issuable upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock) shall be
entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock (or such other stock or securities) for
securities or other property deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation,
merger, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, and the amount per share and character
of such exchange applicable to the Series A Preferred Stock and the Common Stock. Such
notice shall be sent at least 10 days prior to the record date or effective date for the event
specified in such notice. Any notice required by the provisions hercof to be given to a holder of
shares of Series A Preferred Stock shal] be deemed sent to such holder if deposited in the United

the books of the Corporation.

5. Mandatory Conversion.

(a) | Upon the earlier of (A) the closing of the sale of shares of Common Stock

to the Corporation (a “Qualifying Public Offermg”) or (B) a date specified by vote or written
consent of the holders of at Jeast sixty-nine percent (69%) of the then outstanding shares of
Series A Preferred Stock (the “Mandatory Conversion Date’), (i) all outstanding shares of
Series A Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock, at the
then effective conversion rate and (ii) such shares may not be reissued by the Corporation as
shares of such series.

(b) — All holders of record of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be given
written notice of the Mandatory Conversion Date and the place designated for mandatory
conversion of all such shares of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to this Subsection 5. Such
notice need not be given in advance of the occurrence of the Mandatory Conversion Date. Such
notice shall be sent by first class or registered mail, postage prepaid, or given by electronic
communication in compliance with the provisions of the General Corporation Law, to each
record holder of Series A Preferred Stock. Upon receipt of such notice, each holder of shares of
Series A Preferred Stock shall surrender his, her or its certificate or certificates for all such

18

USIDOCS 55318946
shares to the Corporation at the place designated in such notice, and shall thereafter receive

to this Subsection 5, On the Mandatory Conversion Date, all outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have been converted into shares of Common Stock, which
shal] be deemed to be outstanding of record, and all rights with respect to the Series A Preferred

holder of Common Stock), will terminate, except only the rights of the holders thereof, upon
surrender of their certificate or certificates therefor, to receive certificates for the number of
shares of Common Stock into which such Series A Preferred Stock has been converted, and
payment of any declared but unpaid dividends thereon. If so required by the Corporation,
certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by written instrument

issuable upon such conversion.

(c) All certificates evidencing shares of Series A Preferred Stock which are
required to be surrendered for conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof shall, from

purposes, notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender such
certificates on or pricr to such date. Such converted Series A Preferred Stock may not be
reissued as shares of such Series, and the Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate
action (without the need for stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized
number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock accordingly.

5.A Special Mandatory Conversion.

(a) In the event that any holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock does not
participate in a Qualified Financing (as defined below) by purchasing in the aggregate, in such
Qualified Financing and within the time period specified by the Corporation (provided that the
Corporation has given such holder at least ten (10) days written notice of the Qualified
Financing), such holder’s Pro Rata Amount (as defined below), then each share of Series A
Preferred Stock held by such holder shall automatically, and without any further action on the
part of such holder, be converted into shares of Common Stock at the Series A Conversion Price
in effect immediately prior to the < consummation-ef such-Qualified Financing, effective upon,
subject to, and concurrently with, the consummation of the Qualified Financing. For purposes of
de‘ermining the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock owned by a holder, and for
determining the number of Offered Securities a holder of Series A Preferred Stock has purchased
in a Qualified Financing, all shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by Affiliates of such holder
shall be aggregated with such holder’s shares and al] Offered Securities purchased by Affiliates
of such holder shall be aggregated with the Offered Securities purchased by such holder
(provided that no shares or securities shall be attributed to more than one entity or person within

19

USIDOCS $£252894v6
any such group of affiliated entities or persons). Upon such conversion (a ‘Special Mandatory
Conversion”), any shares of Series A Preferred Stock so converted shall be cancelled and not

written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly
executed by the registered holder or by his, her or its attorney duly authorized in writing. As
soon. as practicable after the Special Mandatory Conversion and the surrender of the certificate or
certificates for Series A Preferred Stock so converted, the Corporation shail cause to be issued
and delivered to such holder, or on his, her or its written order, a certificate or certificates for the
number of full shares of Common Stock issuable on such conversion in accordance with the
provisions hereof and, cash as provided in Subsection 4(b) in respect of any fraction of a share of
Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion.

(c) All certificates evidencing shares of Series A Preferred Stock which are
required to be surrendered for conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof shall, from
and after the time of the Special Mandatory Conversion, be deemed to have been retired and
cancelled, and the shares of Series A Preferred Stock converted pursuant to Subsection 5A(a)
represented thereby shall, from and after the time of the Special Mandatory Conversion, be
deemed to have been converted into Common Stock for all purposes, notwithstanding the failure
of the holder or holders thereof to surrender such certificates on or prior to such date. The
Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate action (without the need for stockholder action)
as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock
accordingly.

(d) For purposes of this Subsection 5A, the following definitions shall apply:

(i) “Affiliate” shall mean, with respect to any holder of shares of

holders. In the event the Qualified Financing results in gross proceeds to the Corporation in
excess of $3,500,000, then the Offered Securities stial] mean that amount of the debt or equity
securities so set aside by the Board of Directors of the Corporation having an aggregate purchase
price of $3,500,000.

(ii) “Pro Rata Amount” shall mean, with respect to any holder of
Series A Preferred Stock, the lesser of (a) a number of Offered Securities (or in the case of debt
securities, the original principal amount of such securities) calculated by multiplying the
aggregate number of Offered Securities (or in the case of debt securities, the original principal
amount of such securities) by a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the number of shares
of Series A Preferred Stock owned by such holder, and the denominator of which is equal to the
aggregate number of outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, or (b) the maximum
number of Offered Securities (or in the case of debt securities, the original principal amount of
such securities) that such holder is permitted by the Corporation to purchase in such Qualified

three annual installments commencing 60 days after receipt by the Corporation at any time on or
after February 24, 2010, from the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding shares of
Series A Preferred Stack, of written notice requesting redemption of all shares of Series A
Preferred Stock (the date of each such installment being referred to as a “Redemption Date’).
On each Redemption Date, the Corporation shall recleem, on a pro rata basis in accordance with
the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock owned by each holder, that number of
outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock determined by dividing (i) the total number of
shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Redemption Date by
(ii) the number of remaining Redemption Dates (including the Redemption Date to which such
calculation applies), If the Corporation does not have sufficient funds legally available to redeem
on any Redemption Date all shares of Series A Preferred Stock and of any other class or series of
stock to be redeemed on such Redemption Date, the Corporation shall redeem a pro rata portion
of each holder’s redeemable shares of such stock out of funds legally available therefor, based on
the respective amounts which would otherwise te payable in respect of the shares to be
redeemed if the legally available funds were sufficient to redeem all such shares, and shall
redeem the remaining shares to have been redeemed as soon as practicable after the Corporation
has funds legally available therefor.

21

Redemption Date, each holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such
Redemption Date, unless such holder has exercised his, her or its right to convert such shares as
provided in Subsection 4 hereof, shall surrender the certificate or certificates representing such
shares to the Corporation, in the manner and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice,
and thereupon the Redemption Price for such shares shall be payable to the order of the person
whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof, and each surrendered
certificate shall be canceled and retired. In the event less than all of the shares of Series A
Preferred Stock represented by a certificate are redeemed, a new certificate representing the
unredeemed shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall promptly be issued to such holder.

(d) Rights Subsequent to Redemption. If the Redemption Notice shall have
been duly given, and if on the applicable Redemption Date the Redemption Price payable upon
redemption of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such Redemption Date is
paid or tendered for payment or deposited with an independent payment agent so as to be

alleged to have been taken or omitted in such capacity, against all expenses (including attomeys’
fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by or on
behalf of Indemnitee in connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal
therefrom, if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably

criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was
unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement,
conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a
presumption that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee
reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, and, with
respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his or her
conduct was unlawful.

2. Actions or Suits by or in the Right of the Corporation. The Corporation shall

indemnify any Indemnitee who was or is a party {o or threatened to be made a party to any
threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a

best interests of the Corporation, except that no indemnification shall be made under the Section
2 in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which Indemnitee shall have been adjudged to be
liable to the Corporation, unless, and only to the extent, that the Court of Chancery of Delaware
shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of such liability but in view of all
the circumstances of the case, Indemnitee is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such
expenses (including attorneys’ fees) which the Court of Chancery of Delaware shall deem
proper.

proceeding or investigation, other than as provided below in this Section 4. Indemnitee shall
have the right to employ his or her own counsel in connection with such action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, but the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred after notice from the
Corporation of its assumption of the defense thereof shall be at the expense of Indemnitee unless
(i) the employment of counsel by Indemnitee fas been authorized by the Corporation,
(ii) counsel to Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest
or position on any significant issue between the Corporation and Indemnitee in the conduct of

any claim brought by or in the right of the Corporation or as to which counsel for Indemnitee
shall have reasonably made the conclusion provided for in clause (ii) above. The Corporation

consent. Neither the Corporation nor Indemnitee wi:l unreasonably withhold or delay its consent
to any proposed settlement.

5. Advance of Expenses. Subject to the provisions of Section 6 of this Article
TENTH, in the event of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation of which the Corporation
receives notice under this Article, any expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by or on
behalf of an Indemnitee in defending an action, suit, proceeding or investigation or any appeal
therefrom shall be paid by the Corporation in advence of the final disposition of such matter;
provided, however, that the payment of such expenses incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in
advance of the final disposition of such matter shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking
by or on behalf of Indemnitee to repay all amounts so advanced in the event that it shall
ultimately be determined that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as
authorized in this Article; and further provided that no such advancement of expenses shall be
made under this Article TENTH if it is determined (in the manner described in Section 6) that (i)
Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or
not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, or (ii) with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding, Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. Such
undertaking shall be accepted without reference to the financial ability of Indemnitee to make
such repayment,

advancement of expenses pursuant to Section I, 2, 3 or 5 of this Article TENTH, an Indemnitee

25

USIDOCS $535894v6
made promptly, and in any event within 60 days after receipt by the Corporation of the written
request of Indemnitee, unless (i) the Corporation has assumed the defense pursuant to Section 4
of this Article TENTH (and none of the circumstances described in Section 4 of this Article
TENTH that would nonetheless entitle the Indemnitee to indemnification for the fees and
expenses of separate counsel have occurred) or (ii) the Corporation determines within such
60-day period that Indemnitee did not meet the applicable standard of conduct set forth in
Section 1, 2 or 5 of this Article TENTH, as the case may be. Any such indemnification, unless
ordered by a court, shall be made with respect to requests under Section | or 2 only as authorized
in the specific case upon a determination by the Corporation that the indemnification of
Indemnitee is proper because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in
Section 1 or 2, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made in each instance (a) by a
majority vote of the directors of the Corporation consisting of persons who are not at that time
parties to the action, suit or proceeding in question (“disinterested directors”), whether or not a
quorum, (b)by a committee of disinterested directors designated by majority vote of
disinterested directors, whether or not a quorum, (c) if there are no disinterested directors, or if
the disinterested directors so direct, by independent legal counsel (who may, to the extent
permitted by law, be regular legal counsel to the Corporation) in a written opinion, or (d) by the
stockholders of the Corporation.

7, Remedies. The right to indemnification or advancement of expenses as granted
by this Article shall be enforceable by Indemnitee in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Neither the failure of the Corporation to have made a determination prior to the commencement
of such action that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met
the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Corporation pursuant to
Section 6 of this Article TENTH that Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of
conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met the
applicable standard of conduct. Indemnitee’s expenses (including attorneys’ fees) reasonably
incurred in connection with successfully establishing Indemnitee’s right to indemnification, in
whole or in part, in any such proceeding shall also be indemnified by the Corporation.

8. Limitations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article, except as
set forth in Section 7 of this Article TENTH, the Corporation shall not indemnify an Indemnitee
pursuant to this Article TENTH in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by
such Indemnitee unless the initiation thereof was approved by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article, the Corporation shall not
indemnify an Indemnitee to the extent such Indemnitee is reimbursed from the proceeds of
insurance, and in the event the Corporation makes any indemnification payments to an
Indemnitee and such Indemnitee is subsequently reimbursed from the proceeds of insurance,
Indemnitee shall promptly refund such indemnification payments to the Corporation to the extent
of such insurance reimbursement.

9. Subsequent Amendment. No amendment, termination or repeal of this Article or
of the relevant provisions of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or any other applicable
laws shail affect or diminish in any way the rights of any Indemnitee to indemnification under
the provisions hereof with respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of

26

USIDOCS 5835894v6
or relating to any actions, transactions or facts occurring prior to the final adoption of such
amendment, termination or repeal.

10. Other Rights. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by this
Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnitee seeking
indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any law (common or
statutory), agreement or vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to
action in Indemnitee’s official capacity and as to action in any other capacity while holding
office for the Corporation, and shall continue as to ari Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director
or officer, and shall inure to the benefit of the estate, heirs, executors and administrators of
Indemnitee. Nothing contained in this Article shall be deemed to prohibit, and the Corporation is
specifically authorized to enter into, agreements with officers and directors providing
indemnification rights and procedures different from those set forth in this Article. In addition,
the Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by its Board of Directors, grant
indemnification rights to other employees or agents of the Corporation or other persons serving

the Corporation and such rights may be equivalent to, or greater or less than, those set forth in
this Article.

Article ta indemnification by the Corporation for some or a portion of the expenses (including
attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines or amounts paid in, settlement actually and reasonably incurred
by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation
and any appeal therefrom but not, however, for the total amount thereof, the Corporation shall

judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement to which Indemnitee is entitled.

to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another

his status as such, whether or not the Corporatior. would have the power to indemnify such
person against such expense, liability or loss under the General Corporation Law of Delaware.

13. Savings Clause. If this Article or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any
ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify
each Indemnitee as to any expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts
paid in settlement in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal or administrative, including an action by or in the right of the Corporation, to the fullest
extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article that shall not have been invalidated and
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.
