cash at the rate of $0.0266, $0.0712 and $0.2144 per share per annum, respectively (each as adjusted
for any stock dividends, combination, splits, recapitalizations and the like with respect to such
shares), before any dividend is paid on Common Stock. Dividends may be declared and paid upon
Common Stock in any fiscal year of the corporation only if dividends shall have been paid to or
declared and set apart upon all shares of Preferred Stock at such annual rate for such fiscal year of
the corporation. After such dividends are declared and paid upon the shares of Preferred Stock,
dividends may be declared and paid on the Common Stock if at the same time equivalent dividends

B Preferred and Series C Preferred, respectively, then held by them, and, in addition, an amount
equal to all declared but unpaid dividends cn the Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred and Series C
Preferred, respectively. If upon the occurren:e of such event, the assets and funds thus distributed
among the holders of the Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred and Series C Preferred shall be
insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full aforesaid preferential amounts, then the
entire assets and funds of the corporation legally available for distribution shall be distributed among
the holders of the Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred and Series C Preferred in proportion to the
full aforesaid preferential amounts to which each such holder is entitled. In lieu of receiving the

(ii) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be deemed
to be the average of the closing bid prices over the 30-day period ending three (3) business days

Stock remains outstanding, all of the directors will be elected by all of the holders of Common and

contrary, the shareholders entitled to elect a particular director shall be entitled to remove such
director or to fill a vacancy in the seat formerly held by such director, all in accordance with the
applicable provisions under California law.

D. Conversion. The holders of Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as follows
(the "Conversion Rights"):

1. Right to Convert. Each share of each series of Preferred Stock shall be
convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time into such number of fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Issuance Price (as defined
below) by the Conversion Price (as defined below) in effect at the time of conversion. The Issuance
Price for the Series A Preferred, the Series B Preferred and the Series C Preferred shall be $0.333,
$0.89 and $2.68, respectively. The Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred
and Series C Preferred shall initially be $0.333, $0.89 and $2.68, respectively, subject to adjustment
as provided below. Such initial Conversion Prices shall be adjusted as hereinafter provided.

2. Automatic Conversion. Each share of Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred
and Series C Preferred shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the
respective Conversion Prices at the time in effect for such series of Preferred Stock immediately
upon the earlier of (i) the corporation’s sale of its Common Stock in an underwritten public offering
pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”), which
results in the Company’s Common Stock being listed for trading on a national securities exchange or
the Nasdaq National Market; or (ii) the date specified by written consent or agreement of at least
two-thirds (2/3) of the then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, voting together as a class, to
such corversion.

3. Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to convert the same into full shares of Common Stock and to receive certificates therefor, he
shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the corporation
or of any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the corporation at
such office that such holder elects to convert the same; provided, however, that in the event of an

PALLIBINGS8\1 176900.08(P83_08!.DO0C) 4
automatic conversion pursuant to Section D.2 above, the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall
be converted automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or
not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the corporation or its transfer agent,
and provided further that the corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such automatic conversion unless the certificates evidencing
such shares of Preferred Stock are either delivered to the corporation or its transfer agent as provided
above, or the holder notifies the corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost,
stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the corporation to indemnify the
corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates. The corporation shall,
as soon as practicable after such delivery, or such ag.eement and indemnification in the case of a lost
certificate, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which the holder shall be entitled and a
check payable te the holder in the amount of any cash amounts payable as the result of a conversion
into fractional shares of Common Stock. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made
immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender —f the shares of Preferred
Stock to be converted, or in the case of automatic conversion, on the date of closing of the offering,
and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such
conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of
Common Stock on such date.

4. Fractional Shares. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder of
Preferred Stock would otherwise be entitled, the corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction
muitizlied by the fair market value of one share of Preferred Stock as determined by the Board of
Directors of the corporation. Whether or not fractional shares are issuable upon such conversion
shall be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock of each holder at
the time converting into Common Stock and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
such aggregate conversion.

E. e Adiu: of Preferred Stock for Certain Dilutive Issuances. The
respective Conversion Prices of the Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time
as follows:

i. If the corporation shall issue, after the date upon which any shares of

Preferred Stock were first issued (the “Purchase Date” with respect to such series), any Additional
Stock (as defined below) the Conversion Price for such series in effect immediately prior to each
such issuance shall forthwith be adjusted to a new Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock
equal to a fraction the numerator of which shall be the sum of (A) the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding on the Purchase Date of such series, multiplied by the Issuance Price of such
series, plus (B) the aggregate consideration received by the corporation for the total number of
shares of Additional Stock so issued or sold (or deemed issued or sold); and the denominator of
which shall be the sum of (A) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior
to such issuance or sale, plus (B) the number of shares of such Additional Stock so issued or sold (or
deemed issued or sold); provided, however that the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred
Stock shall at no time exceed the respective Issuance Price of such series of Preferred Stock as
adjusted for stock splits, combinations and similar acts. For the purposes hereof, the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding shall be deemed to include all shares of Common Stock

PALLIBI\IGS\I 176900.08(P83_08!.D0C) 5
actually outstanding and all shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise, conversion or
exchange of all outstanding options, warrants and convertible securities.

taken into account in any subsequent adjustment made prior to three years from the date of the event
giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward, or shall be made at the end of three years from
the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward. Except to the limited extent
provided for in subsections (d){iii) and (d)(iv) below, no adjustment of such Conversion Price
pursuant to this sub-section E1(a) shall have the effect of increasing the applicable Conversion Price
above the applicable Conversion Price in effect immedia‘ely prior to such adjustment.

(b) Inthe case of the issuance of Common Stock for cash, the
consideration shail be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting any discounts,
commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by this corporation for any underwriting or
otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be deemed to be the fair

the corporation upon the issuance of such options or rights plus the minimum exercise price
provided in such options or rights for the Common Stock covered thereby.

deliverable upon conversion of or in exchange for any such convertible or exchangeable securities or
upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or exchangeable
securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof shall be deemed to have been issued at the

to the consideration, if any, reezived by the corporation for any such securities and related options or
rights (excluding any cash received on account of accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the
minimum additional consideration, if any, to be received by the corporation upon the conversion or
exchange of such securities or the exercise of any related options or rights (the consideration in each
case to be determined in the manner provided in sub-section E1.)

such securities.

issuance of only the number of shares of Common Stock (and convertible or exchangeable securities
which remain in effect) actually issued upon the exercise of such options or rights, upon the
conversion or exchange of such securities or upon the exercise of the options or rights related to such
securities.
