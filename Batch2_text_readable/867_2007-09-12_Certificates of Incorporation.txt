resulting from such split shall be rounded up to the nearest whole share. Any numerical values
or calculations set forth in this Certificate of Incorporation reflect such conversions of the
Corporation’s capital stock and accordingly no further adjustment shall be made to such numbers

of Common Stock or Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number
of shares then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock of the
Corporation entitled to vote thereon.

A. Common Stock. Except as otherwise provided by the DGCL or by this
Certificate of Incorporation:

1. the holders of the Class A Common Stock shall have the right to vote for
the election of directors to the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the “Beard of Directors”)
and on all other matters requiring stockholder action, each share of Class A Common Stock
being entitled to one vote;

2. the Class B Common Stock shall not be entitled to any voting rights, and
each share of Class B Common Stock shall otherwise have the attributes of one (1) share of Class
A Common Stock;

3, dividends may be declared and paid or set apart for payment upon the
Common Stock out of any assets or funds of the Corporation legally available for the payment of
dividends, but only when and as declared by the Board of Directors or any authorized committee
thereof;

4, upon the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of
the Corporation, the net assets of the Corporation shall be distributed pro rata to the holders of
the Common Stock in accordance with their respective rights and interests; and

5. the Corporation has the option, at any time, and upon the election of the
Board of Directors or any authorized committee thereof, to redeem all, but not less than all, of
the issued and outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock whereupon the Corporation shall
issue one share (1) of Class A Common Stock in exchange for each share of Class B Common
Stock redeemed. Upon the exercise of such option, any right to receive a share of Class B
Common Stock shall be converted into a right to receive one share (1) of Class A Common
Stock.

B. Preferred Stock. Unless otherwise specifically provided herein, the Series
A Preferred and Series B Preferred shall rank pari passu with respect to dividend rights, rights
upon liquidation, winding up or dissolution, and redemption rights, taking into account their
respective Liquidation Prices (as defined below) (subject to the additional amount, if any,
payable to holders of Series A Preferred pursuant to Section B.2(a)(i)(y)) and Redemption Prices
(as defined below). The powers, preferences and rights, and the qualifications, limitations or
restrictions of the Preferred Stock are as follows:

1. Dividends. (a) Base Dividends. The holders of Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to receive, out of funds legally available therefor, cumulative cash dividends at
the rate equal to the applicable Preferred Dividend Rate (as defined below) before any
dividend or Distribution (as defined below) is declared and paid on shares of Common
Stock. The “Preferred Dividend Rate” shall be (i) with respect to the Series A
Preferred, eight percent (8%) per annum of the Series A Initial Purchase Price (as defined
below) (as may be appropriately adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split,
recapitalization or consolidation) for the period beginning on the Series A Original
Issuance Date (as defined below) to the Series B Original Issuance Date (as defined
below) (the “Prior Series A Dividends”), and thereafter, six percent (6%) per annum of
the Series A Liquidation Price (as defined below) (as may be appropriately adjusted for
any stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization or consolidation) beginning on the
Series B Original Issuance Date, and (ii) with respect to the Series B Preferred, six
percent (6%) per annum of the Series B Liquidation Price (as defined below) (as may be
appropriately adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization or
consolidation). The dividends that accrue on the Preferred Stock after the Series B
Original Issuance Date are sometimes referred to herein as the “Post-Closing
Dividends.” “Distribution” shall mean the transfer of cash or property by the
Corporation to one or more of its stockholders without consideration, whether by
dividend or otherwise (except a dividend in shares of the Corporation’s stock), except
with respect to employees of the Corporation upon termination of their employment or

services. The Preferred Stock dividends shall begin accruing upon the issuance of the
applicable series of Preferred Stock, and will accrue quarterly in arrears. Accrued and
unpaid dividends, shall be paid when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of
funds legally available for the purpose. The Board of Directors may fix a record date for
the determination of holders of Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend
declared thereon, which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed
for the payment thereof (in accordance with the terms of this Section B.1). The
Corporation shall not pay dividends on or make any other Distribution on the Common
Stock until all accrued but unpaid dividends on the Preferred Stock have been declared
and paid or set apart.
(b) Additional Dividends. After all accrued but unpaid dividends on the
Preferred Stock have been declared and paid or set apart pursuant to Section B.1(a), if the
Board of Directors shall elect to declare additional dividends, such additional dividends
shall be declared in equal amounts per share on all shares of the Preferred Stock and the
Common Stock, but with each share of the Preferred Stock being entitled to dividends
based on the number of shares of Class A Common Stock into which such share of
Preferred Stock could be converted as of the record date for the determination of
stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or, if no record date is established, on the
date such dividend is declared.

(c) Forfeit of Dividends. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in
the event of a Qualified Offering (as defined herein) or a Qualified Liquidation Event (as
defined herein with respect to the applicable series of Preferred Stock), all accrued and
unpaid dividends will be forfeited by the holders of the Preferred Stock.

(d) Non-Cash Dividends. Whenever a dividend or Distribution provided for
in this Section B.1 shall be payable in property other than cash, the value of such dividend
or Distribution shall be deemed to be the fair market value of such property as determined
in good faith by the Board of Directors.

2. Liquidation Preference. (a) Series A Preference. Upon any liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation (a “Liquidation Event”), no
distribution shall be made to the holders of the Common Stock unless, prior to the first such
distribution, the holders of Series B Preferred shall have received the amount set forth in Section
B.2(b) below and the holders of Series A Preferred shall have received an amount equal to the
greater of:

(i) the sum of: (x) $2.40 per share of Series A Preferred (as appropriately
adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization or
consolidation affecting the Series A Preferred) plus all accrued but unpaid
dividends, whether or not declared, on the Series A Preferred (the “Series
A Liquidation Price”) and (y) any additional amount payable to such
holder of Series A Preferred if, after the payments referred to in Sections
B.2(a)(i)(x) and B.2(b)(i) have been made in full to all holders of Preferred
Stock, the remaining assets available for distribution were distributed
among the holders of Series A Preferred (as if they had converted all their
shares of Series A Preferred into Class A Common Stock in accordance
with the provisions of Section B.3 immediately prior to such Liquidation
Event) and Common Stock ratably in proportion to the number of shares
of Common Stock held by each of them while giving effect to Article IV,
Section A.4 (subject to, but only to the extent that the amount payable
under this Section B.2(a)(i)(y), together with the amount payable pursuant
to Section B.2(a)(i)(x), does not exceed $7.20 per share of Series A
Preferred (as appropriately adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split,
recapitalization or consolidation affecting the Series A Preferred)); and
(ii)

(b)

an amount per share of Series A Preferred as would have been payable had
all shares of Series A Preferred been converted into Class A Common
Stock pursuant to the provisions of Section B.3 immediately prior to such
Liquidation Event (a Liquidation Event in which this Section B.2(a\(ii)
applies shall be deemed a “Qualified Liquidation Event” in respect of
the Series A Preferred for purposes of Section B.1(c)).

Series B Preference. Upon any Liquidation Event, no distribution shall be

made to the holders of the Common Stock unless, prior to the first such distribution, the
holders of Series A Preferred shall have received the amount set forth in Section B.2(a)
above and the holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall have received an amount equal to

the greater of:

(i)

(ii)

(c)

$7.34 per share of Series B Preferred (as appropriately adjusted for any
stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization or consolidation affecting the
Series B Preferred) plus all accrued but unpaid dividends, whether or not
declared, on the Series B Preferred (the “Series B Liquidation Price”);
and

an amount per share of Series B Preferred as would have been payable had
all shares of Series B Preferred been converted into Class A Common
Stock pursuant to the provisions of Section B.3 immediately prior to such
Liquidation Event (a Liquidation Event in which this Section B.2(b)(ii)
applies shall be deemed a “Qualified Liquidation Event” in respect of
the Series B Preferred for purposes of Section B.1(c)).

Priority of Liquidation Payments. If the assets distributable in any such

Liquidation Event to the holders of the Preferred Stock are insufficient to permit the
payment to such holders of the full preferential amounts to which they may be entitled
pursuant to Sections B.2(a)(i)(x) and B.2(b)(i), such assets shall be distributed as follows
(subject to Section B.1(c) hereof):

(i)

Before any distribution or payment shall be made pursuant to

Section B.2(c)(ii), Section B.2(c)(iii), Section B.2(a)(i)(y) or Section A,
the holders of Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred shall be entitled to
receive an amount per share equal to the Series A Initial Purchase Price
and Series B Initial Purchase Price, respectively. In the event that the
assets distributable in any such Liquidation Event to the holders of the
Preferred Stock are insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of
the full preferential amounts set forth in this Section B.2(c)(i), such assets
shall be distributed ratably, on an equal priority, pari passu basis, among
the holders of the Preferred Stock in proportion to the preferential amount
each such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to this
Section B.2(c)(i).
(it) After the payments in Section B.2(c)(i) have been made in full, but before
any distribution or payment shall be made pursuant to Section B.2(c)(iii),
Section B.2(a)(i)(y) or Section A, the holders of Series A Preferred shall
be entitled to receive an amount per share equal to the Prior Series A
Dividends accrued but unpaid, whether or not declared, on such share. In
the event that the assets distributable in any such Liquidation Event to the
holders of the Preferred Stock are insufficient to permit the payment to the
holders of Series A Preferred of the full preferential amount set forth in
this Section B.2(c)(ii), the assets remaining after full distribution pursuant
to Section B.2(c)(i) shall be distributed ratably, on an equal priority, pari
passu basis, among the holders of Series A Preferred Stock in proportion
to the preferential amount each such holder would otherwise be entitled to
receive pursuant to this Section B.2(c)(ii).

(iii) | After the payments in Sections B.2(c)(i) and B.2(c)(ii) have been made in
full, but before any distribution or payment shall be made pursuant to
Section B.2(a)(i)(y) or Section A, the holders of Series A Preferred and
Series B Preferred shall be entitled to receive an amount per share equal to
the Post-Closing Dividends accrued but unpaid, whether or not declared,
on such share as of the date of such Liquidation Event. In the event that
the assets distributable in any such Liquidation Event to the holders of the
Preferred Stock are insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of
the full preferential amounts set forth in this Section B.2(c)(iii), the assets
remaining after full distribution pursuant to Sections B.2(c)(i) and
B.2(c)(ii) shall be distributed ratably, on an equal priority, pari passu
basis, among the holders of the Preferred Stock in proportion to the
preferential amount each such holder would otherwise be entitled to
receive pursuant to this Section B.2(c)(iii).

(d) Deemed Liquidation. For purposes of this Section B.2, (i) the sale,
conveyance, exchange, exclusive license or other transfer of all or substantially all of the
intellectual property or assets of the Corporation, (ii) any acquisition of the Corporation
in which the Corporation is a party, by means of a consolidation, stock exchange, merger
or other form of corporate reorganization of the Corporation with any other corporation in
which the Corporation’s stockholders immediately prior to such stock exchange, merger
or other reorganization own less than a majority of the voting securities of the surviving
entity immediately following such transaction or (iii) any transaction or series of related
transactions in which the Corporation is a party, to a person or group of persons (other
than an underwriter of the Corporation’s securities), following which such person or
group of persons would hold more than 50% of the outstanding voting stock of the
Corporation (any such event, a “Change of Control”) shall be deemed a Liquidation
Event.

(e) Valuation of Non-Cash Property. Whenever any distribution provided for
in this Article IV shall be payable in securities or property other than cash, then the value
of such distribution shall be the fair market value of such distribution as determined in
good faith by the Board of Directors, except that any publicly-traded securities to be
distributed to stockholders will be valued as follows:

(i) Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar restrictions on
free marketability:

(1) If traded on a securities exchange, the value shall be deemed to be
the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange over the thirty (30)-
day period ending three (3) calendar days prior to the closing; and

(2) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be deemed to be
the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever are applicable) over the thirty
(30)-day period ending three (3) calendar days prior to the closing.

(ii) | The method of valuation of securities subject to investment letter or other
restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of a
stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate
discount from the market value determined as above in Sections B.2(e)(i)(1) and (2) to
reflect the approximate fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors.

3, Conversion. The Preferred Stock shall be convertible as follows:

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Series A Preferred shall be convertible,
without the payment of any additional consideration by the holder thereof and at the
option of the holder thereof, at any time at the office of the Corporation or any transfer
agent for the Series A Preferred, into the number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Class A Common Stock determined by dividing $2.40 (the “Series A Initial Purchase
Price”) by the Series A Conversion Price (as defined below) in effect at the time of
conversion. The “Series A Conversion Price” shall initially be the Series A Initial
Purchase Price, and shall be adjusted and readjusted from time to time as provided in this
Section B.3. Each share of Series B Preferred shall be convertible, without the payment
of any additional consideration by the holder thereof and at the option of the holder
thereof, at any time at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for the Series B
Preferred, into the number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Class A Common
Stock determined by dividing $7.34 (the “Series B Initial Purchase Price”; together
with the Series A Initial Purchase Price, each an “Initial Purchase Price”) by the Series
B Conversion Price (as defined below) in effect at the time of conversion. The “Series B
Conversion Price” shall initially be the Series B Initial Purchase Price, and shall be
adjusted and readjusted from time to time as provided in this Section B.3. The Series A
Conversion Price and the Series B Conversion Price are each sometimes referred to
herein as a “Conversion Price.” Certain capitalized terms used in this Section B.3 have
the meanings specified in paragraph (d) of this Section B.3.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically
be converted into fully paid and nonassessable shares of Class A Common Stock at the
then effective Conversion Price applicable to such share of Preferred Stock upon the
earlier to occur of: (i) with respect to the Series A Preferred or the Series B Preferred, as
may be applicable, the date specified in a written election of the holders of at least a
majority of the applicable series of Preferred Stock that wishes to convert then
outstanding with respect to such series of Preferred Stock or (ii) the closing of a firm
commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), covering the offer
and sale of Common Stock at a price per share of Common Stock, prior to underwriting
commissions, of at least two times the Series B Initial Purchase Price (as appropriately
adjusted for any stock split, dividend, combination, recapitalization or the like), with an
aggregate offering price, prior to underwriting commissions, of not less than $50 million
(a “Qualified Offering”) (in the event of which Qualified Offering, the person(s) entitled
to receive the Class A Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of the Preferred
Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior
to the closing of such offering).

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of Class A Common
Stock shall be issued upon conversion of the Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional
shares to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash
equal to such fraction multiplied by the then effective Conversion Price applicable to such
share of Preferred Stock. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert
the same into Class A Common Stock (or, in the case of automatic conversion of
Preferred Stock pursuant to Section B.3(b) hereof, before any holder of such Preferred
Stock so converted shall be entitled to receive a certificate or certificates evidencing the
shares of Class A Common Stock upon such conversion), such holder shall surrender to
the Corporation at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for the Preferred
Stock, the certificate or certificates representing such Preferred Stock, accompanied by
written notice to the Corporation that such holder elects to convert all or a specified
number of such shares (or, in the case of such automatic conversion, such holder is
surrendering the same) and stating therein such holder’s name or the name or names of
such holder’s nominees in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for
Class A Common Stock to be issued. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable
thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to such
holder’s nominee or nominees, a certificate or certificates representing the number of
shares of Class A Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid,
together with cash in lieu of any fractional share and, if less than the full number of shares
of Preferred Stock evidenced by such surrendered certificate or certificates are being
converted, a new certificate or certificates, of like tenor, for the number of shares of
Preferred Stock evidenced by such surrendered certificate less the number of such shares
being converted. Any conversion made at the election of a holder of Preferred Stock shall
be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of
such surrender of the Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled
to receive the Class A Common Stock issuable upon conversion shall be treated for all
purposes as the record holder or holders of such Class A Common Stock on such date. If
the conversion is in connection with an underwritten offer of securities registered
pursuant to the Securities Act, the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering
Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriter of
the sale of securities pursuant to such offering, in which event the person(s) entitled to
receive the Class A Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of the Preferred Stock
shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the
closing of such sale of securities.

(d) Adjustments to Conversion Price for Diluting Issues.

(i) Special Definitions. For purposes of this Section B.3, the following
definitions shall apply:

(1) “Options” shall mean rights, options or warrants to subscribe for,

(3) “Convertible Securities” shall mean any evidences of

indirectly convertible into or exchangeable for Additional Shares of Common Stock.

(4) “Additional Shares of Common Stock” shall mean all shares of

Corporation after the applicable Original Issue Date, other than:

(A) Class A Common Stock issued or issuable upon conversion
of the Preferred Stock or the Class B Common Stock;

(B) up to 3,764,751 shares of Class B Common Stock issued or

distribution on shares of Common Stock excluded from the definition of Additional

all outstanding securities exercisable or exchangeable for, or convertible into, shares of
Class A Common Stock (including shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon the
redemption of the Class B Common Stock).

(it) | Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock.

(1) Options and Convertible Securities. In the event the Corporation at
any time, or from time to time after the applicable Original Issue Date, shall issue, sell,
grant or assume any Options or Convertible Securities or shall fix a record date for the
determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive any such Options or
Convertible Securities, then, and in each such case, the maximum number of shares of
Common Stock (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto without regard to any
provisions contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon
the exercise of such Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities and Options
therefor, the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to
be Additional Shares of Common Stock issued as of the time of such issue, sale, grant or
assumption or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business
on such record date (unless such shares are excluded from the definition of Additional
Shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section B.3(d)(i)(4)), provided that in any such case
in which Additional Shares of Common Stock are deemed to be issued:

(A) no further adjustment in the applicable Conversion Price
shall be made upon the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities or Common Stock
upon the exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities;

(B) if such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms
provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any decrease in the consideration
payable to the Corporation, or increase in the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable, upon the exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, the applicable Conversion
Price computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date
with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon any such

10
decrease or increase becoming effective, be recomputed to reflect such increase or
decrease insofar as it affects such Options or the rights of conversion or exchange under
such Convertible Securities which are outstanding at such time;

(C) upon the expiration of any such Options or any rights of
conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have been fully
exercised, the applicable Conversion Price computed upon the original issue, sale, grant
or assumption thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and
any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon such expiration, be recomputed as
if:

(I) in the case of such Convertible Securities or
Options for Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common Stock issued or sold
were the shares of Common Stock, if any, actually issued or sold upon the exercise of
such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities and the
consideration received for such Additional Shares of Common Stock was, in the case of
Options, the consideration actually received by the Corporation for the issue, sale, grant
or assumption of all such Options, whether or not exercised, plus the consideration
actually received by the Corporation upon such exercise, or, in the case of Convertible
Securities, the consideration actually received by the Corporation for the issue, sale or
assumption of all such Convertible Securities which were actually converted or
exchanged, plus the additional consideration, if any, actually received by the Corporation
upon such conversion or exchange, and

(1) in the case of Options for Convertible Securities,
only the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued or sold upon the exercise thereof
were issued at the time of issue, sale, grant or assumption of such Options, and the
consideration received by the Corporation for the Additional Shares of Common Stock
deemed to have been then issued was the consideration actually received by the
Corporation for the issue, sale, grant or assumption of all such Options, whether or not
exercised, plus the consideration deemed to have been received by the Corporation
(determined pursuant to Section B.3(d)(iv)) upon the issue or sale of the Convertible
Securities with respect to which such Options were actually exercised;

(D) no readjustment pursuant to clause (B) or (C) above shall
have the effect of increasing the applicable Conversion Price to an amount which exceeds
the lower of (i) the Conversion Price immediately prior to the original issuance of such
Options or Convertible Securities or (ii) the applicable Conversion Price that would have
resulted from any issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock between the date of
the original issuance of such Options or Convertible Securities and the readjustment date
therefor, as provided for in clause (B) or (C), as applicable;

(E) In the case of any Options which expire by their terms not
more than 30 days after the date of issue, sale, grant or assumption thereof, no adjustment
of the Conversion Price shall be made until the expiration or exercise of all such Options,

11
whereupon such adjustment shall be made in the same manner provided in clause (C)
above.

(iii) Adjustment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional Shares of

Common Stock. In the event the Corporation shall issue or be deemed to issue
Additional Shares of Common Stock for a consideration per share Jess than the Series A
Conversion Price or Series B Conversion Price, as may be applicable, in effect on the date
of and immediately prior to such issue, then and in such event, the applicable Conversion
Price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue or sale (or deemed issue or sale) in
order to increase the number of shares of Class A Common Stock into which such
applicable series of Preferred Stock is convertible, to a price (calculated to the nearest
cent) determined by multiplying the applicable Conversion Price by a fraction (x) the
numerator of which shall be (1) the number of shares of Common Stock Deemed
Outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale (or deemed issue or sale), plus (2) the
number of shares of Class A Common Stock which the aggregate consideration received
by the Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued
(or deemed issued) would purchase at the applicable Conversion Price, and (y) the
denominator of which shall be (1) the number of shares of Common Stock Deemed
Outstanding immediately prior to such issue (or deemed issue) plus (2) the number of
such Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued (or deemed issued), provided that no
Conversion Price shall be so reduced at such time if the amount of such reduction would
be an amount less than $.01, but any such amount shal! be carried forward and reduction
with respect thereto made at the time of and together with any subsequent reduction
which, together with such amount and any other amounts so carried forward shall
aggregate $.01 or more.

(iv) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this Section B.3(d), the
consideration received (or deemed to be received) by the Corporation for the issue or sale
of any Additional Shares of Common Stock (or any Additional Shares of Common Stock
deemed to be issued pursuant to Section B.3(d)(ii)(1)) shall be computed as follows:

(1) Cash and Property. The consideration per share received by the
Corporation for the issue or sale of Additional Shares of Common Stock shall:

(A) _ insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the aggregate
amount of cash received by the Corporation excluding amounts paid or payable for
accrued interest or accrued dividends and before deduction of any underwriting or similar
commissions, compensation or concessions paid or allowed by the Corporation in
connection with such issue or sale without deduction of any expenses payable by the
Corporation;

(B) _ insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair value thereof at the time of such issue or sale, as determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors; and

12
(C) in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock are issued
together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for
consideration which covers both, be the portion of such consideration so received,
computed as provided in clauses (A) and (B) above, allocable to such Additional Shares
of Common Stock as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(2) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per share

deemed to be received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock
deemed to have been issued pursuant to Section B.3(d)(ii)(1), relating to Options and
Convertible Securities, shall be determined by dividing:

(x) the total amount, if any, actually received by the Corporation as
consideration for the issue, sale, grant or assumption of such Options or Convertible
Securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth
in the instruments relating to such Options or Convertible Securities without regard to
any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration)
payable to the Corporation upon the exercise in full of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible
Securities, the exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, by

(y) the maximum number of Additional Shares of Common Stock (as
set forth in the instruments relating to such Options or Convertible Securities, without
regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number)
issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities.

(v) Adjustment for Stock Dividends, Distributions, Subdivisions,

Combinations or Consolidation of Common Stock.

(1) Stock Dividends, Distributions and Subdivisions. In the event the
Corporation shall declare or pay any dividend or make any other distribution on the
Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or shall effect a subdivision of the
outstanding Class A Common Stock, into a greater number of shares of Class A Common
Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of
Common Stock), the applicable Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such
stock dividend, distribution or subdivision shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of
such stock dividend, distribution or subdivision, be proportionately decreased.

(2) | Combinations or Consolidation of Common Stock. In the event
the outstanding Class A Common Stock shall be combined or consolidated, by
reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of Class A Common Stock,
the applicable Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such combination or
consolidation shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination or
consolidation, be proportionately increased.

13
(vi) Adjustments for Consolidation, Merger, Sale of Assets, Reorganization,

Etc. In the event the Corporation, after the Series B Original Issue Date, (1) shall
consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (2) shall
permit any other corporation or entity to consolidate with or merge into the Corporation
and the Corporation shall be the continuing or surviving corporation but, in connection
with such consolidation or merger, the shares of Common Stock shall be changed into or
exchanged for stock or other securities of any other person or cash or any other property,
or (3) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties or assets to any other
corporation or entity, then, and in each such event, proper provision shall be made so that,
upon the basis and the terms and in the manner provided in this Section B.3(d)(vi), each
holder of Preferred Stock, upon the conversion thereof at any time after the
consummation of such consolidation, merger, transfer, reorganization or reclassification,
shall be entitled to receive, in lieu of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such
conversion prior to such consummation, the stock and other securities, cash and property
to which such holder would have been entitled upon such consummation if such holder
had converted such Preferred Stock immediately prior thereto, subject to adjustments
(subsequent to such corporate action) as nearly equivalent as possible to the adjustments
provided for in this Section B.3. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, the Corporation will not effect any of the transactions described in clauses (1)
through (3) above unless, prior to the consummation thereof, each entity (other than the
Corporation) which may be required to deliver any stock, securities, cash or property
upon the conversion of Preferred Stock shall assume, by written instrument delivered to
each holder of Preferred Stock, the obligation to deliver to such holder such shares of
stock, securities, cash or property as such holder may be entitled to receive upon such
conversion, and such entity shall have furnished to each holder of Preferred Stock an
opinion of counsel for such entity, which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to such
holder, stating that the holder of such Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to
receive, upon the conversion of such shares, the stock, securities, cash or property which
such corporation may be required to deliver pursuant to the terms hereof.

(vii) Adjustments for Other Distributions. In the event the Corporation at any
time or from time to time makes, or fixes a record date for the determination of holders of
Common Stock entitled to receive, any distribution payable in securities of the
Corporation other than shares of Common Stock and other than as otherwise adjusted in
this Section B.3, then and in each such event provision shall be made so that the holders
of Preferred Stock shall receive upon conversion thereof, in addition to the number of
shares of Common Stock receivable thereupon, the amount of securities of the
Corporation which they would have received had their shares of Preferred Stock been
converted into Common Stock on the date of such event and had they thereafter, during
the period from the date of such event to and including the date of conversion, retained
such securities receivable by them as aforesaid during such period, subject to all other
adjustments called for during such period under this Section B.3 with respect to the rights
of the holders of the Preferred Stock. The Corporation shall not distribute securities of
the Corporation to holders of any series or class of Common Stock without effecting a

14
proportional and equivalent distribution to the holders of all other series or classes of
Common Stock (subject to the provisions of Article IV, Section A).

(viii) Adjustments for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. If the Class

A Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be changed
into the same or a different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock,
whether by capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision,
combination or consolidation of shares provided for above), the applicable Conversion
Price of each series of Preferred Stock then in effect shall, concurrently with the
effectiveness of such reorganization or reclassification, be proportionately adjusted such
that each series of Preferred Stock shall be convertible into, in lieu of the number of
shares of Class A Common Stock which the holders would otherwise have been entitled
to receive, a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock equivalent to the
number of shares of Class A Common Stock that would have been subject to receipt by
the holders upon conversion of such shares of Preferred Stock immediately before that
change. No series or class of Common Stock shall be so changed into shares of any other
class or classes of stock unless a proportional and equivalent change shall be made with
respect to all other series or classes of Common Stock; provided, however, that the Class
B Common Stock may be redeemed and converted into Class A Common Stock as
provided in Article IV, Section A.S.

(e) Other Dilutive Events. If any event occurs as to which the other
provisions of this Section B.3 are not strictly applicable but the failure to make any
adjustment would not fairly protect the anti-dilution rights set forth in this Section B.3 in
accordance with the essential intent and principles hereof, then, in each case, the
Corporation’s Board of Directors will make appropriate adjustment in the Conversion
Price or otherwise so as to protect the rights of the holders of Preferred Stock.

(f) No Impairment. The Corporation will not, by amendment of its Certificate
of Incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger,
dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid
the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder
by the Corporation but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the
provisions of this Section B.3 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or
appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock
against impairment. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Corporation
(i) will not permit the par value of any shares of stock at the time receivable upon the
conversion of the Preferred Stock to exceed the applicable Conversion Price then in
effect, (ii) will take all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order that the
Corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid nonassessable shares of stock on the
conversion of the Preferred Stock, and (iii) will not take any action which results in any
adjustment of the applicable Conversion Price if after such action the total number of
shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of all of the Preferred Stock will
exceed the total number of shares of Common Stock then authorized by the Corporation’s
Certificate of Incorporation and available for the purpose of issue upon such conversion.

15
(g) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the applicable Conversion Price pursuant to this Section B.3, the
Corporation at its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in
accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to each holder of Preferred Stock for which
the Conversion Price was adjusted, a certificate setting forth such adjustment or
readjustment and showing in reasonable detail the facts upon which such adjustment or
readjustment is based, including a statement of (i) the consideration received or to be
received by the Corporation for any Additional Shares of Common Stock issued or sold
or deemed to have been issued, (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
or deemed to be outstanding, and (iii) the applicable Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such issue or sale and as adjusted and readjusted on account thereof.
The Corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of Preferred
Stock furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) the
applicable Conversion Price at the time in effect, and showing how it was calculated, and
(ii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property
which at the time would be received upon the conversion of Preferred Stock.

(h) Notices of Record Date. In the event of any taking by the Corporation of a
record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders
thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend or other distribution, or any right to
subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of stock of any class or any other
securities or property, or to receive any other right, the Corporation shall mail to each
holder of Preferred Stock at least 10 days prior to the date specified therein, a notice
specifying the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such
dividend or distribution.

(i) Common Stock Reserved. The Corporation shall at all times reserve and
keep available out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock such number of shares
of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect conversion of the
Preferred Stock.

(j) Waiver of Adjustment of Conversion Price. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, the operation of, and any adjustment to the Series A Conversion
Price pursuant to this Section B.3 may be waived in writing only by the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred, which waiver shall be binding
on all current and future holders of Series A Preferred and in respect of all shares of
Series A Preferred. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the operation of, and
any adjustment to the Series B Conversion Price pursuant to this Section B.3 may be
waived in writing only by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series B
Preferred, which waiver shall be binding on all current and future holders of Series B
Preferred and in respect of all shares of Series B Preferred.

4. Redemption. The Corporation shall give written notice (the “Redemption
Notice’’) to each holder of Preferred Stock at least 90 days and no more than 120 days
prior to the scheduled redemption dates provided below, stating that it will redeem all of
the Preferred Stock as provided herein so long as the holders of 51% or more of the

16
outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock (calculated on an as-converted basis) approve
such redemption by delivery to the Corporation of written approval within 60 days of
receipt of the Redemption Notice (the “Approval Notice’), such notice to be addressed
to each holder at the address as it appears on the stock transfer books of the Corporation
and to specify the date of redemption and the number of shares to be redeemed.

Subject to delivery of the applicable Approval Notice, the Corporation shall
redeem for cash out of any funds legally available therefore: (i) on the date that is the
fifth anniversary of the Series B Original Issue Date (as such term is defined in Section
B.3(d)), 33.4% of the Preferred Stock held by each holder of Preferred Stock on that date;
(ii) on the date that is the sixth anniversary of the Series B Original Issue Date, 50% of
the Preferred Stock held by each holder of Preferred Stock on that date; and (iii) on the
date that is the seventh anniversary of the Series B Original Issue Date, all of the
Preferred Stock held by each holder of Preferred Stock on that date (each such date, a
“Redemption Date”). On each Redemption Date, each holder’s redemption shall be
made proportionately among all series of Preferred Stock held by a given holder on an as-
converted basis. Redemptions pursuant to this Section B.4 shall be made for a per-share
price equal to the greater of (i) the applicable Liquidation Price for the applicable series
of Preferred Stock as set forth in Section B.2 hereof and (ii) the fair market value of a
share of the applicable series of Preferred Stock on the date thirty days prior to such
Redemption Date as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors (such valuation
and an explanation of the methodology used in calculating such valuation to be delivered
to each holder of Preferred Stock at least 10 days prior to the applicable Redemption
Date) (in respect of the Series A Preferred, the “Series A Redemption Price,” and in
respect of the Series B Preferred, the “Series B Redemption Price,” and collectively, the
“Redemption Price”); provided that if there shall be a good faith objection to such fair
market value determination by the holders of at least 51% of the then outstanding (x)
Common Stock or (y) Preferred Stock (in each case, on an as-converted basis) within 10
days of the receipt thereof by the holders of the Preferred Stock, such fair market value
shall be conclusively determined by an independent appraiser selected by the Corporation
and holders of not less than 51% of the outstanding Preferred Stock (on an as-converted
basis) or, if such persons cannot agree upon an appraiser, each of the Corporation and
such holders will select an independent appraiser, and such two appraisers will in turn
mutually agree on a third appraiser, and such third appraiser’s determination of such fair
market value shall be final and binding on the parties. The fees and expenses of any
appraiser shall be paid (i) by the Corporation if such fair market value as determined by
such independent appraiser varies by more than 10% from the determination of fair
market value proposed by the Corporation prior to the selection of such independent
appraiser, (ii) in the event that the holders of Preferred Stock objected to the fair market
valuation and obligated the Corporation to hire an independent appraiser, by the holders
of the Preferred Stock pro rata in proportion to the number of shares of the Preferred
Stock owned by such holder on an as-converted basis if such fair market value as
determined by such independent appraiser is within or equal to 10% of the determination
of the fair market value proposed by the Corporation prior to the selection of such
independent appraiser and (iii) in the event that the holders of Common Stock objected to

17
the fair market valuation and obligated the Corporation to hire an independent appraiser,
by the holders of the Common Stock pro rata in proportion to the number of shares of the
Common Stock owned by such holder on an as-converted basis if such fair market value
as determined by such independent appraiser is within or equal to 10% of the
determination of the fair market value proposed by the Corporation prior to the selection
of such independent appraiser. The Corporation shall pay interest at the rate of 8% on
such redemption price from the applicable Redemption Date through the date the
Redemption Price is paid. In connection with the determination of fair market value of
the Corporation as a whole for purposes of the foregoing redemption provisions, the value
of each share of Preferred Stock shall be equal to the quotient of (x) the highest price for
which the Corporation could be sold to an independent third party, assuming a reasonable
time to accomplish such sale, divided by (y) the number of outstanding shares of the
Corporation as calculated on a fully diluted basis. The Corporation need not establish any
sinking fund for the redemption of Preferred Stock.

On or after the date of redemption unless postponed or waived as provided below,
each holder of Preferred Stock shall surrender a certificate or certificates representing the
number of shares of the Preferred Stock to be redeemed as stated in the notice provided
by the Corporation. If less than all the shares represented by such certificates are to be
redeemed, the Corporation shall forthwith issue a new certificate, of like tenor, for the
unredeemed shares.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holders of 51% or more of the Preferred Stock,
calculated on an as-converted basis, shall have the right to postpone the Redemption
Dates or waive (on a pro rata basis) the obligation of the Corporation to redeem all or part
of the Preferred Stock, by written notice given to the Corporation. The Corporation shall
not redeem the Preferred Stock of any holder of Preferred Stock until the scheduled
Redemption Date, if any. In the event the holders of Preferred Stock shall postpone or
waive the obligation of the Corporation to redeem their Preferred Stock in the manner
provided above, the Corporation shall be deemed to postpone or waive its right to redeem
the Preferred Stock.

For the purpose of determining whether funds are legally available for redemption
of Preferred Stock as provided herein, the Corporation shall value its assets at the highest
amount permissible under applicable law. If on any Redemption Date (as the same may
postponed, as provided above) funds of the Corporation legally available therefor shall be
insufficient to redeem all the Preferred Stock required to be redeemed as provided herein,
funds to the extent legally available shall be used for such purpose and the Corporation
shall effect such redemption pro rata according to the number of shares held by each
holder of Preferred Stock on an as-converted basis. The redemption requirements
provided hereby shall be continuous, so that if on any Redemption Date such
requirements shall not be fully discharged, without further action by any holder of
Preferred Stock funds legally available shall be applied therefor until such requirements
are fully discharged (unless the holders elect to postpone or waive the applicable
redemption, as provided above).

18
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if the determination of
fair market value is being disputed in accordance with the terms of this Section B.4, the
obligation to redeem shall be suspended until the date following the final resolution of the
determination of such fair market value.

5. Voting Rights.

(a) General Voting Rights. The holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled, on
all matters submitted for a vote of the holders of shares of Common Stock, whether
pursuant to law or otherwise, to one vote for each whole share of Class A Common Stock
issuable as of the date of such vote upon the conversion of each share of Preferred Stock
held, and on all such matters shall vote together as one class with the holders of Common
Stock and the holders of all other shares of stock entitled to vote with the holders of
Common Stock on such matters. In addition, the holders of Preferred Stock shall have

share of Preferred Stock), in person or by proxy, either in writing without a meeting or at

Corporation’s Bylaws or Certificate of Incorporation;

pursuant to Section B.3(d) hereof) or apply any of the Corporation’s assets to the
redemption, retirement, purchase or other acquisition directly or indirectly, through
subsidiaries or otherwise, of any shares of Common Stock except from employees of the
Corporation upon termination of their employment or services;

(iv) create or issue any class or classes of stock or series of Preferred Stock, or
authorize any security convertible into, or exchangeable for, capital stock of the

(v) increase the number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock;

(vi) | consummate any merger, liquidation, consolidation or other corporate
reorganization of the Corporation or any transaction or series of transactions resulting in a
Change of Control;

(vii) increase the maximum authorized number of directors of the Corporation
to more than eight; or

(viii) voluntarily liquidate or dissolve.

(c) Series A Preferred Protective Provisions. Without the consent of the
holders at least a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Series A Preferred, voting
separately as a single class (each share of Series A Preferred having a vote equal to the
number of whole shares of Class A Common Stock issuable as of the date of such vote
upon conversion of such share of Series A Preferred), in person or by proxy, either in
writing without a meeting or at a special or annual meeting of stockholders called for the
purpose, the Corporation shall not:

(i) amend the Corporation’s Certificate of Incorporation to alter or change the
powers, preferences or special rights of the Series A Preferred so as to affect them
adversely without similarly so affecting all other series of Preferred Stock adversely; or

(ii) _ prior to the first anniversary of the Series B Original Issue Date, effect a
Change of Control that results in aggregate proceeds payable to the Corporation or its
securityholders of less than $226,000,000.

(d) Series B Preferred Protective Provisions. Without the consent of the
holders at least a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Series B Preferred, voting
separately as a single class (each share of Series B Preferred having a vote equal to the
number of whole shares of Class A Common Stock issuable as of the date of such vote
upon conversion of such share of Series B Preferred), in person or by proxy, either in
writing without a meeting or at a special or annual meeting of stockholders called for the
purpose, the Corporation shall not:

(i) amend the Corporation’s Certificate of Incorporation to alter or change the
powers, preferences or special rights of the Series B Preferred so as to affect them
adversely without similarly so affecting all other series of Preferred Stock adversely;

(ii) | amend or waive (whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise) (1) the
Series B Liquidation Price set forth in Article IV, Section B.2(b) hereof; (2) the Series B
Conversion Price as provided in Article IV, Section B.3(a) hereof; (3) the right to an
adjustment of the Series B Conversion Price as provided in Article IV, Section B.3

B.3(b) hereof; or

(iii) prior to the first anniversary of the Series B Original Issue Date, effect a
Change of Control that results in aggregate proceeds payable to the Corporation or its

ARTICLE V

The following provisions are inserted for the management of the business and for
the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation and for the purpose of creating, defining, limiting
and regulating the powers of the Corporation and its directors and stockholders:

(a) Subject to Section B.5(b)(vii) of Article IV hereof, the number of directors
of the Corporation shall be fixed and may be altered from time to time in the manner
provided in the Bylaws of the Corporation and that certain Second Amended and Restated
Stockholders Agreement, by and among the Corporation and certain of its stockholders,
dated on or about the Series B Original Issuance Date;

(b) The election of directors may be conducted in any manner approved by the
stockholders at the time when the election is held and need not be by written ballot;

(c) All corporate powers and authority of the Corporation (except as at the
time otherwise provided by law, by this Certificate of Incorporation or by the Bylaws)
shall be vested in and exercised by the Board of Directors;

(d) The Board of Directors shall have the power without the assent or vote of
the stockholders to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation, except to
the extent that the Bylaws of the Corporation or this Certificate of Incorporation
otherwise provide; and

(e) No director of the Corporation shall be liable to the Corporation or its
stockholders for monetary damages for breach of his or her fiduciary duty as a director,
provided that nothing contained in this Article shall eliminate or limit the liability of a
director (i) for any breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its
stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional
misconduct or a knowing violation of the law, (iii) under Section 174 of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or (iv) for any transaction from which the
director derived an improper personal benefit.

Any repeal or modification of the foregoing paragraph by the stockholders of the
Corporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation
existing at the time of such repeal or modification.

21
ARTICLE VI

1. Nature of Indemnity. To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL as the
same exists or as may hereafter be amended, the Corporation shall indemnify any person who
was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of
the fact that he or she is or was or has agreed to become a director or officer of the Corporation,
or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in such capacity, and may
indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to such an action,
suit or proceeding by reason of the fact that he or she is or was or has agreed to become an
employee or agent of the Corporation, against expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments,
fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her or on his or
her behalf in connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if he or
she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to
the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding had
no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful; except that in the case of an
action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor (1) such
indemnification shall be limited to expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably
incurred by such person in the defense or settlement of such action or suit, and (2) no
indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person
shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the
Delaware Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall
determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the
circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such
expenses which the Delaware Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.

The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement,
conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a
presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he or she reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any
criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was
unlawful.

2. Successful Defense. To the extent that a present or former director,
officer, employee or agent of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in
defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Section B.1 of this Article VI or in
defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he or she shall be indemnified against expenses
(including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection
therewith.

3. Advance Payment of Expenses. Expenses (including attorneys’ fees)
incurred by a present director or officer in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final
disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of
the director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is
not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article VI. Such expenses

22
(including attorneys’ fees) incurred by former directors and officers or other employees and
agents may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Corporation deems
appropriate. The Corporation, or in respect of a present director or officer the Board of
Directors, may authorize the Corporation’s counsel to represent such present or former director,
officer, employee or agent in any action, suit or proceeding, whether or not the Corporation is a
party to such action, suit or proceeding.

4. Survival; Preservation of Other Rights. The foregoing indemnification
provisions shall be deemed to be a contract between the Corporation and each director, officer,
employee and agent who serves in any such capacity at any time while these provisions as well as
the relevant provisions of the Delaware Corporation Law are in effect and any repeal or
modification thereof shal! not affect any right or obligation then existing with respect to any state
of facts then or previously existing or any action, suit or proceeding previously or thereafter
brought or threatened based in whole or in part upon any such state of facts. Such a “contract
right” may not be modified retroactively without the consent of such director, officer, employee
or agent.

The indemnification provided by this Article VI shall not be deemed exclusive of
any other rights to which those indemnified may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his or her official
capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a
person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit
of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.

ARTICLE VII

In the event that a director of the Corporation who is also a partner or employee of
an entity that is a holder of Preferred Stock and that is in the business of investing and
reinvesting in other entities (each, a “Fund”) acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or
matter in such person’s capacity as a partner or employee of the Fund and that may be a corporate
opportunity for both the Corporation and such Fund (a “Corporate Opportunity”), then (i) such
Corporate Opportunity shall belong to such Fund, (ii) such director shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, have fully satisfied and fulfilled his fiduciary duty to the Corporation and its
stockholders with respect to such Corporate Opportunity, and (iii) the Corporation, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, waives any claim that such Corporate Opportunity constituted a
corporate opportunity that should have been presented to the Corporation or any of its affiliates
provided, however, that such director acts in good faith and such opportunity was not offered to
such person in his or her capacity as a director of the Corporation.
