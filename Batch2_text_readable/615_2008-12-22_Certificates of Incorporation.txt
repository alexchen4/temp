Million Eight Hundred Seventy-Two Thousand Seven Hundred Thirty-Seven (37,872,737)
shares shall be Preferred Stock, each having a par value of one-tenth of one cent ($0,001).

B. Notwithstanding the provisions of 242(b)(2) of the General Corporation Law, the
number of authorized shares of Common Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the
number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding) by (in addition to the vote of the holders
of the Series Preferred required by the terms of this Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation) the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock and Series Preferred (as defined below) of the Company (voting together on an
as-if-converted basis).

(On One million eight hundred eighty four thousand six hundred sixteen (1,884,616)
of the authorized shares of Preferred Stock shall be designated Series Al Preferred Stock (the

(4,481,294) shall be designated Series A2 Preferred Stock (the “Series A2 Preferred”), eleven
million five hundred six thousand eight hundred twenty-seven (11,506,827) shares shall be

the Series Al Preferred, Series A2 Preferred and Series B Preferred, the “Series Preferred”).

D. The rights, preferences, privileges, restrictions and other matters relating to the
Series Preferred are as follows:

1. DIVIDEND RIGHTS.

(a) Holders of Series Preferred, in preference to the holders of any
other stock of the Company (“Junior Stock”), shall be entitled to receive, when and as declared
by the Board of Directors, but only out of funds that are legally available therefor, cash dividends
at the rate of eight percent (8%) of the Original Issue Price (as defined below) per annum on each
outstanding share of Series Preferred (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits,
recapitalizations and the like with respect to such shares). The “Original Issue Price” for the
Series Al Preferred shall be sixty-five cents ($0.65) per share, the “Original Issue Price” for the
Series A2 Preferred shall be one dollar twenty-six cents ($1.26) per share, the “Original Issue
Price” for the Series B Preferred shall be one dollar eighty cents ($1.80) per share and the
“Original Issue Price” for the Series C Preferred shall be one dollar fifty-four cents ($1.54) per
share, in each case, as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations
and the like with respect to such shares after the filing date hereof. Such dividends shall be
payable only when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors and shall be non-cumulative.
No dividend shall be paid or declared on any Series Preferred unless and until all Series
Preferred shall be paid or declared, respectively, such dividends on a pari passu basis giving
effect to the Original Issue Price for each such series of Series Preferred. The holders of the
outstanding Series Preferred may waive any dividend preference with respect to any 12-month
period that such holders are entitled to under this Section 1(a) upon the affirmative vote or
written consent of the holders of at least sixty-two percent (62%) of the then-outstanding shares
of Series A2 Preferred, Series B Preferred and Series C Preferred, voting together as a single
class and on an as-converted to Common Stock basis (a “Preferred Supermaijority”).

GDSVF &H1928461 10 2
(b) _—_ So long as any shares of Series Preferred shall be outstanding, no
dividend, whether in cash or property, shall be paid or declared, nor shall any other distribution
be made, on any Junior Stock, nor shall any shares of any Junior Stock of the Company be
purchased, redeemed, or otherwise acquired for value by the Company (except for acquisitions
of Common Stock by the Company pursuant to agreements which permit the Company to
repurchase such shares upon termination of services to the Company or in exercise of the
Company’s right of first refusal upon a proposed transfer) until all dividends (set forth in
Section 1{a) above) on the Series Preferred shall have been paid or declared and set apart. in the
event dividends are paid on any share of Junior Stock, an additional dividend shall be paid with
respect to all outstanding shares of Series Preferred in an amount equal per share (on an as-if-
converted to Common Stock basis) to the amount paid or set aside for each share of Junior Stock.
The provisions of this Section 1(b) shall not, however, apply to (i) a dividend payable solely in
Common Stock, (ii) the acquisition of shares of any Junior Stock in exchange for shares of any
other Junior Stock, or (iii) any repurchase of any outstanding securities of the Company that is
approved by the Company’s Board of Directors.

the Company and not as a separate class, at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the
Company, and may act by written consent in the same manner as the Common Stock, in either
case upon the following basis: each holder of shares of Series Preferred shall be entitled to such
number of votes as shall be equal to the whole number of shares of Common Stock into which
such holder’s aggregate number of shares of Series Preferred are convertible (pursuant to
Section 4 hereof) immediately after the close of business on the record date fixed for such
meeting or the effective date of such written consent.

(b) Separate Vote of Series A2 Preferred, Series B Preferred and
Series C Preferred. For so long as any shares of Series A2 Preferred, Series B Preferred or
Series C Preferred remain outstanding other than treasury shares, in addition to any other vote or

Company;

(vii) Any increase or decrease in the authorized number of

indebtedness would exceed $500,000, unless such debt security has received the prior approval
of the Company’s Board of Directors; and

that is not expressly made conditional on obtaining the affirmative vote or written consent of
such majority unless such consent has already been obtained.

For so long as any shares of Series Al Preferred or Series A2 Preferred remain outstanding, in
addition to any other vote or consent required herein or by law, the Company shall not effect or
validate any of the following actions (in any case, by merger, consolidation, reorganization,
operation of law or otherwise) without first having obtained the vote or written consent of the
holders of at least sixty-six and two-third percent (667%) of the then-outstanding shares of

(i) Any amendment, alteration, or repeal of any provision of,
or addition of any provision to, the Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Company
(including any filing of a Certificate of Designation), that alters or changes the voting or other
powers, preferences, or other special rights or privileges, or restrictions of the Series Al
Preferred or the Series A2 Preferred so as to affect them adversely; and

(ii) | Any increase or decrease in the authorized number of
shares of Series Al Preferred or Series A2 Preferred,

(d) Separate Vote of Series B Preferred. For so long as any shares
of Series B Preferred remain outstanding, in addition to any other vote or consent required herein

GDSVF&H1928461.10 4
or by law, the Company shall not effect or validate any of the following actions (in any case, by
merger, consolidation, reorganization, operation of law or otherwise) without first having
obtained the vote or written consent of the holders of at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the
then-outstanding shares of Series B Preferred, voting as a separate class:

(i) Any amendment, alteration, or repeal of any provision of,
or addition of any provision to, the Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Company
(including any filing of a Certificate of Designation), that alters or changes the voting or other
powers, preferences, or other special rights or privileges, or restrictions of the Series B Preferred
so as to affect them adversely; and

(i) Any amendment, alteration, or repeal of any provision of,
or addition of any provision to, the Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Company
(including any filing of a Certificate of Designation), that alters or changes the voting or other
powers, preferences, or other special rights or privileges, or restrictions of the Series C Preferred
so as to affect them adversely; and

(ii) | Any increase or decrease in the authorized number of
shares of Series C Preferred.

(f) Election of Board of Directors.

(i) for so long as one million (1,000,000) shares of the
Series Al Preferred and Series A2 Preferred remain outstanding (subject to adjustment for any
stock split, reverse stock split or similar event affecting the Series Al Preferred and Series A2
Preferred), the holders of Series Al Preferred and Series A2 Preferred, voting together as a
separate class on an as-converted basis, shall be entitled to elect two (2) members (the “Series A
Directors”) of the Company’s Board of Directors at each meeting or pursuant to each consent of
the Comipany’s stockholders for the election of directors, and to remove from office such
directors and to fill any vacancy caused by the resignation, death or removal of such directors;

(ii) for so long as one million (1,000,000) shares of the Series
B Preferred remain outstanding (subject to adjustment for any stock split, reverse stock split or
similar event affecting the Series B Preferred), the holders of Series B Preferred, voting as a
separate class, shall be entitled to elect one (1) member (the “Series B Director”) of the
Company’s Board of Directors at each meeting or pursuant to each consent of the Company’s
stockholders for the election of directors, and to remove from office such director and to fill any
vacancy caused by the resignation, death or removal of such director;

GDSVF&H1928461.10 5
(iii) for so long as one million (1,000,000) shares of the Series
C Preferred remain outstanding (subject to adjustment for any stock split, reverse stock split or
similar event affecting the Series C Preferred), the holders of Series C Preferred, voting as a
separate class, shall be entitled to elect one (1) member (the “Series C Director” and together
with the Series A Directors and Series B Director, the “Series Preferred Directors”) of the
Company’s Board of Directors at each meeting or pursuant to each consent of the Company’s
stockholders for the election of directors, and to remove from office such director and to fill any
vacancy caused by the resignation, death or removal of such director;

(iv) the holders of Common Stock, voting together as a separate
class, shall be entitled to elect one (1) member of the Board of Directors at each meeting or
pursuant to each consent of the Company’s stockholders for the election of directors, to remove
from office such director and to fill any vacancy caused by the resignation, death or removal of
such director; and

(v) the holders of the Common Stock and Series Preferred,
voting together as a single class on an as-converted basis, shall be entitled to elect all remaining
members of the Board of Directors at each meeting or pursuant to each consent of the
Company’s stockholders for the election of directors, to remove from office such director and to
fill any vacancy caused by the resignation, death or removal of such director.

(vi) Each of the foregoing directors may be removed during his
or her term of office, either with or without cause, by, and only by, the affirmative vote of the
holders of the shares of the class or series of stock entitled to elect such director, given either at a
special meeting of such stockholders duly called for that purpose or pursuant to the written
consent of such stockholders, and any vacancy in any of the seats held by the foregoing directors
may be filled by, and only by, the affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of the class or
series of stock with the express right to elect the applicable director.

(vii) No person entitled to vote at an election for directors may
cumulate votes to which such person is entitled, unless, at the time of such election, the
Company is subject to Section 2115 of the California Corporations Code (“CGCL”). During
such time or times that the Company is subject to Section 2115(b) of the CGCL, every
stockholder entitled to vote at an election for directors may cumulate such stockholder’s votes
and give one candidate a number of votes equal to the number of directors to be elected
multiplied by the number of votes to which such stockholder’s shares are otherwise entitled, or
distribute the stockholder’s votes on the same principle among as many candidates as such
stockholder desires. No stockholder, however, shal] be entitled to so cumulate such
stockholder’s votes unless (i) the names of such candidate or candidates have been placed in
nomination prior to the voting and (ii) the stockholder has given notice at the meeting, prior to
the voting, of such stockholder’s intention to cumulate such stockholder’s votes. If any
stockholder has given proper notice to cumulate votes, all stockholders may cumulate their votes
for any candidates who have been properly placed in nomination. Under cumulative voting, the
candidates receiving the highest number of votes, up to the number of directors to be elected, are
elected.

GDSVF&H\928461,10 6
(g) | During such time or times that the Company is subject to Section
2115(b) of the CGCL, one or more directors may be removed from office at any time without
cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares
entitled to vote separately for that director as provided above; provided, however, that unless the
entire Board is removed, no individual director may be removed when the votes cast against such
director’s removal, or not consenting in writing to such removal, would be sufficient to elect that
director if voted cumulatively at an election which the same total number of votes were cast (or,
if such action is taken by written consent, all shares entitled to vote were voted) and the entire
number of directors authorized at the time of such director’s most recent election were then
being elected.

3. LIQUIDATION RIGHTS.
(a) Series C Liquidation Preference.

(i) Upon any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the
Company, whether voluntary or involuntary (a “Liquidation”), before any distribution or
payment shall be made to the holders of any Series Al Preferred, Series A2 Preferred, Series B
Preferred or Junior Stock, the holders of Series C Preferred shall be entitled to be paid out of the
Net Proceeds (as defined below) received or to be received in respect of a Liquidation, an
amount per share equal to the Series C Liquidation Preference Amount (as defined below) for
each share of Series C Preferred held by them. If upon any Liquidation, the Net Proceeds shall
be insufficient to make payment in full to all holders of Series C Preferred of the liquidation
preference set forth in this Section 3(a), then such Net Proceeds legally available for distribution
shall be distributed among the holders of Series C Preferred at the time outstanding, ratably in
proportion to the full amounts to which they would otherwise be respectively entitled. The
“Series C Liquidation Preference Amount” shall mean (1) 2.5 times the Original Issue Price of
the Series C Preferred plus any declared but unpaid dividends on each share of Series C
Preferred when the Net Proceeds received or to be received in respect of a Liquidation are equal
to or less than $100,000,000, (2) 1.0 times the Original Issue Price of the Series C Preferred plus
any declared but unpaid dividends on each share of Series C Preferred when the Net Proceeds
received or to be received in respect of a Liquidation are equal to or greater than $300,000,000
and (3) “X” times the Original Issue Price of the Series C Preferred plus any declared but unpaid
dividends on each share of Series C Preferred when the Net Proceeds received or to be received
in respect of a Liquidation are less than $300,000,000 but greater than $100,000,000, where “X”
equals a fraction, the numerator of which shall be $433,333,333 minus the amount of Net
Proceeds and the denominator of which shall be $133,333,333. For sake of example and the
avoidance of doubt, ifthe Net Proceeds from a Liquidation equal $200,000,000 then the resulting
equation would be X = (433,333,333 — 200,000,000)/133,333,333) with the result in this
example being that X = 1.75 times the Original Issue Price of the Series C Preferred.

(ii) | “Net_Proceeds” shall mean the amount of actual gross
consideration received or to be received by the Company or its stockholders in respect of a
Liquidation, including, but not limited to, all cash, securities, earnout payments, escrow amounts
or other contingent payments, reduced by all (i) costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection
with such Liquidation, (ii) indebtedness prepaid, repaid or required to be prepaid or repaid, and
(iii) all taxes paid or payable by the Company in respect thereof.

GDSVF&H192846 1.10 7
(iii) | For purposes of determining whether the aggregate Net
Proceeds are equal to or less than $100,000,000, greater than $100,000,000 but less than
$300,000,000, or equal to or greater than $300,000,000 (each, a “Liquidation Threshold”) in
connection with any event of Liquidation that includes contingent consideration, earnout,
deferred or similar potential future consideration (a “Staged Payment Liquidation”), Net
Proceeds shall be the final aggregate Net Proceeds after all such contingencies have been
fulfilled or removed, as appropriate (the “Aggregate Net Proceeds”). To the extent that a portion
of the Net Proceeds from a Staged Payment Liquidation (“Partial Liquidation Amounts”) is
available for distribution prior to being able to calculate the Aggregate Net Proceeds and there
exists the possibility that if 100% of the potential Net Proceeds from such Staged Payment
Liquidation (the “Complete Net Proceeds”) were received, the Liquidation Threshold based on
all Partial Liquidation Amounts available to date could be different than the Liquidation
Threshold if the Complete Net Proceeds were received, then prior to the distribution of each
Partial Liquidation Amount, the Company shall place into an escrow account for later
distribution to the Company’s stockholders pursuant to this Section 3 that amount of such Partial
Liquidation Amount which allows the Company to distribute the appropriate amount of Net
Proceeds to each Company stockholder when the Aggregate Net Proceeds is finally determined
and available for distribution.

(b) After the payment of the full liquidation preference of the Series C
Preferred as set forth in Section 3(a) above, before any distribution or payment shall be made to
the holders of any Junior Stock, the holders of Series Al Preferred, Series A2 Preferred and
Series B Preferred shall be entitled to be paid out of the Net Proceeds, an amount per share equal
to the sum of the respective Original Issue Price applicable to such share of Series Preferred plus
all declared and unpaid dividends on such share of Series Preferred for each share of Series
Preferred held by them. If, upon any Liquidation, the Net Proceeds shall be insufficient to make
payment in full to all holders of Series Al Preferred, Series A2 Preferred and Series B Preferred
of the liquidation preference set forth in this Section 3(b), then such Net Proceeds legally
available for distribution shall be distributed among the holders of Series Al Preferred, Series
A2 Preferred and Series B Preferred at the time outstanding, ratably in proportion to the full
amounts to which they would otherwise be respectively entitled.

(c) After the payment of the full liquidation preferences of the Series
Preferred as set forth in Sections 3(a) and 3(b) above, the remaining Net Proceeds legally
available for distribution, if any, shall be distributed ratably to the holders of Series Preferred and
Common Stock, on an as-if-converted to Common Stock basis.

(d) Unless otherwise determined by the Preferred Supermajority, the.
following events shall be considered a “Liquidation” under this Section 3:

(i) any consolidation or merger of the Company with or into
any other corporation or other entity or person, or any other corporate reorganization, in which
the stockholders of the Company immediately prior to such consolidation, merger or
reorganization, own less than 50% of the Company’s voting power immediately after such
consolidation, merger or reorganization, or any transaction or series of related transactions to
which the Company is a party in which in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the Company’s voting
power is transferred (an “Acquisition”); provided, however, that an Acquisition shall not include

GDSVF&H1928461.10 8
any consolidation or merger effected exclusively to change the domicile of the Company, any
transactions or series of transactions principally for bona fide equity financing purposes in which
cash is received by the Company or indebtedness of the Company is cancelled or converted, or a
combination thereof; or

(ii)  asale, lease, transfer, exclusive license or other disposition
of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company (an “Asset Transfer”).

In the event of an Acquisition or Asset Transfer that is considered
a Liquidation, all consideration payable to the stockholders of the Company in connection with
any Acquisition, or all consideration payable to the Company and distributable to its
stockholders, together with all other available assets of the Company (net of obligations owed by
the Company that are senior to the Series Preferred), in connection with any Asset Transfer, shall
be, as applicable, paid by the purchaser to the holders of, or distributed by the Company in
redemption (out of funds legally available therefor) of, the Series Preferred and any Junior Stock
in accordance with the preferences and priorities set forth in this Section 3, with such preferences
and priorities specifically intended to be applicable in any such Acquisition or Asset Transfer, as
if such transaction were a Liquidation. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Company shall take
such actions as are necessary to give effect to the provisions of this Section 3, including without
limitation, (i) in the case of an Acquisition, causing the definitive agreement relating to such
Acquisition to provide for a rate at which the shares of Series Preferred are converted into or
exchanged for cash, new securities or other property which gives effect to the preferences and
priorities set forth in this Section 3, or (ii) in the case of an Asset Transfer, redeeming the Series
Preferred. The Company shall promptly provide to the holders of shares of Series Preferred such
information concerning the terms of such Acquisition or Asset Transfer, and the value of the
assets of the Company as may reasonably be requested by the holders of Series Preferred. The
amount deemed distributed to the holders of Series Preferred upon any such transaction shall be
the cash or the value of the property, rights or securities distributed to such holders by the
Company or the acquiring person, firm or other entity, as applicable. Any determination by such
Preferred Supermajority pursuant to this Section 3(d) shall be made by written notice to the
Company and the other holders of Series Preferred promptly after the closing of such relevant
transaction. Upon the determination by such Preferred Supermajority, all holders of Series
Preferred shall be deemed to have made such election and such election shall bind all holders of
the Series Preferred.

(e) In any of such events, if the consideration received by the
Company is other than cash, its value will be deemed to be its fair market value as determined in
good faith by the Board of Directors. Any securities shall be valued as follows:

(i) Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar
restrictions on free marketability covered by (ii) below:

(A) _ If traded on a securities exchange or through the
Nasdaq Stock Market, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the
securities on such quotation system over the thirty (30) day period ending three (3) days prior to
the closing of such transaction;

GDSVF&H1928461 10 9
(B) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall
be deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the
thirty (30) day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing of such transaction; and

(C) If there is no active public market, the value shall be
the fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(ii) | The method of valuation of securities subject to investment
letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of
a shareholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount
from the market value determined as above in (i) (A), (B) or (C) to reflect the approximate fair
market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

4, CONVERSION RIGHTS.

The holders of the Series Preferred shall have the following rights with
respect to the conversion of the Series Preferred into shares of Common Stock (the “Conversion

Rights”):

(a) Optional Conversion. Subject to and in compliance with the
provisions of this Section 4, any shares of Series Preferred may, at the option of the holder, be
converted at any time, and without the payment of additional consideration by the holder thereof,
into fully-paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock. The number of shares of Common
Stock to which a holder of Series Preferred shall be entitled upon conversion shall be the product
obtained by multiplying the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Rate then in effect and
applicable to such shares (determined as provided in Section 4(b)) by the number of shares of
Series Preferred being converted. Any conversion required under Section 2.3(b) of the Series C
Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement dated on or around December 22, 2008 (the “Purchase
Agreement’), shall be deemed to be an optional conversion pursuant to this Section 4(a) with
respect to each Non-Participating Purchaser (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) and with
respect to such shares of Series Preferred required to be converted under said Section 2.3(b).

(b) Series Preferred Conversion Rate. The conversion rate in effect
at any time for conversion of the Series Al Preferred (the “Series Al Conversion Rate”) shall be
the quotient obtained by dividing the Original Issue Price of the Series Al Preferred by the
Series Al Conversion Price, calculated as provided in Section 4(c). The conversion rate in effect
at any time for conversion of the Series A2 Preferred (the “Series A2 Conversion Rate”) shall be
the quotient obtained by dividing the Original Issue Price of the Series A2 Preferred by the
Series A2 Conversion Price, calculated as provided in Section 4(c), The conversion rate in effect
at any time for conversion of the Series B Preferred (the “Series B Conversion Rate”) shall be
the quotient obtained by dividing the Original Issue Price of the Series B Preferred by the Series
B Conversion Price, calculated as provided in Section 4(c). The conversion rate in effect at any
time for conversion of the Series C Preferred (the “Series C Conversion Rate”) shall be the
quotient obtained by dividing the Original Issue Price of the Series C Preferred by the Series C
Conversion Price, calculated as provided in Section 4(c). Such Series Al Conversion Rate,
Series A2 Conversion Rate, Series B Conversion Rate and Series C Conversion Rate as the case
may be, is referred to as the Series Preferred Conversion Rate.

GDSVF&H\928461.10 10
(c) Series Preferred Conversion Price. The conversion price for the
Series Al Preferred shall initially be the Original Issue Price of the Series Al Preferred (the
“Series AJ Preferred Conversion Price”). The conversion price for the Series A2 Preferred shall
initially be the Original Issue Price of the Series A2 Preferred (the “Series A2 Preferred
Conversion Price”). The conversion price for the Series B Preferred shall initially be the
Original Issue Price of the Series B Preferred (the “Series B Preferred Conversion Price”). The
conversion price for the Series C Preferred shall initially be the Original Issue Price of the Series
C Preferred (the “Series C Preferred Conversion Price”). Such initial Series Al Preferred
Conversion Price, Series A2 Preferred Conversion Price, Series B Preferred Conversion Price
and Series C Preferred Conversion Price, as the case may be, shall be referred to as the “Series
Preferred Conversion Price” and shall be adjusted from time to time in accordance with this
Section 4. All references to the Series Preferred Conversion Price herein shall mean the Series
Preferred Conversion Price as so adjusted.

(d) Mechanics of Conversion. Each holder of Series Preferred who
desires to convert the same into shares of Common Stock pursuant to this Section 4 (other than
pursuant to Section 4(1)) shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at
the office of the Company or any transfer agent for the Series Preferred (or such holder shall
notify the Company or any transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or
destroyed and shall execute an agreement reasonably satisfactory to the Company to indemnify
the Company from any loss incurred by it in connection therewith), and shall give written notice
to the Company at such office that such holder elects to convert the same. Such notice shall state
the number of shares of Series Preferred being converted. Thereupon, the Company shall
promptly issue and deliver at such office to such holder a certificate or certificates for the
number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled and shall promptly pay in

_ cash or, to the extent sufficient funds are not then legally available therefor, in Common Stock
(at the Common Stock’s fair market value determined in good faith by the Board of Directors as
of the date of such conversion), any declared and unpaid dividends on the shares of Series
Preferred being converted. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made at the close of
business on the date of such surrender of the certificates representing the shares of Series
Preferred to be converted, and the person entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such
shares of Common Stock on such date.

(e) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If the Company
shall at any time or from time to time after the date that the first share of Series Preferred is
issued (the “Original Jssue Date”) (as applicable to each series of Series Preferred) effect a
subdivision of the outstanding Common Stock without a corresponding subdivision of the Series
Preferred, the Series Preferred Conversion Price in effect immediately before that subdivision
shall be proportionately decreased. Conversely, if the Company shall at any time or from time to
time after the Original Issue Date (as applicable to each series of Series Preferred) combine the
outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares without a corresponding
combination of the Series Preferred, the Series Preferred Conversion Price in effect immediately
before the combination shall be proportionately increased. Any adjustment under this
Section 4(e) shall become effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or
combination becomes effective.

GDSVF&H1928461.10 1]
(f) Adjustment for Common Stock Dividends and Distributions.
If the Company at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date (as applicable to
each series of Series Preferred) makes, or fixes a record date for the determination of holders of
Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable solely in additional
shares of Common Stock, in each such event the Series Preferred Conversion Price that is then in
effect shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance or, in the event such record date is fixed,
as of the close of business on such record date, by multiplying the Series Preferred Conversion
Price then in effect by a fraction (i) the numerator of which is the total number of shares of
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the
close of business on such record date, and (ii) the denominator of which is the total number of
shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance
or the close of business on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable
in payment of such dividend or distribution; provided, however, that if such record date is fixed
and such dividend is not fully paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed
therefor, the Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close
of business on such record date and thereafter the Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be
adjusted pursuant to this Section 4(f) to reflect the actual payment of such dividend or
distribution.

(g) Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. If
at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date (as applicable to each series of
Series Preferred), the Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Series Preferred is
changed into the same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock, whether
by recapitalization, reclassification or otherwise (other than an Acquisition or Asset Transfer as
defined in Section 3(d) or a subdivision or combination of shares or stock dividend or a
reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale of assets provided for elsewhere in this Section 4),
in any such event each holder of Series Preferred shall have the right thereafter to convert such
stock into the kind and amount of stock and other securities and property receivable upon such
recapitalization, reclassification or other change by holders of the maximum number of shares of
Common Stock into which such shares of Series Preferred could have been converted
immediately prior to such recapitalization, reclassification or change, all subject to further
adjustment as provided herein or with respect to such other securities or property by the terms
thereof. "

(bh) Reorganizations, Mergers or Consolidations. If at any time or
from time to time after the Original Issue Date (as applicable to each series of Series Preferred),
there is a capital reorganization of the Common Stock or the merger or consolidation of the
Company with or into another corporation or another entity or person (other than an Acquisition
or Asset Transfer as defined in Section 3(d) or a recapitalization, subdivision, combination,
reclassification, exchange or substitution of shares provided for elsewhere in this Section 4), as a
part of such capital reorganization, provision shall be made so that the holders of the Series
Preferred shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of the Series Preferred the
number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the Company to which a holder of the
number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled on
such event, subject to adjustment in respect of such stock or securities by the terms thereof. In
any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this
Section 4 with respect to the rights of the holders of Series Preferred after such event to the end

GDSVF&H\928461.10 12
that the provisions of this Section 4 (including adjustment of the Series Preferred Conversion
Price then in effect and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Series Preferred)
shall be applicable after that event and be as nearly equivalent as practicable.

(i) Sale of Shares Below Series Preferred Conversion Price.

(i) If at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue
Date (as applicable to each series of Series Preferred), the Company issues or sells, or is deemed
by the express provisions of this Section 4(i) to have issued or sold, Additional Shares of
Common Stock (as defined in subsection (i)(iv) below), other than for any transaction addressed
by Section 4(e), 4(f) or 4(g) above, for an Effective Price (as defined in subsection (i)(iv) below)
less than the then effective Series Preferred Conversion Price, then, and in each such case, the
then existing Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be reduced, as of the opening of business
on the date of such issue or sale, to a price determined by multiplying the Series Preferred
Conversion Price by a fraction (i) the numerator of which shall be (A) the number of shares of
Common Stock deemed outstanding (as defined below) immediately prior to such issue or sale,
plus (B) the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration received (as
defined in subsection (i)(ii)) by the Company for the total number of Additional Shares of
Common Stock so issued would purchase at such then effective Series Preferred Conversion
Price, and (ii) the denominator of which shall be (A) the number of shares of Common Stock
deemed outstanding (as defined below) immediately prior to such issue or sale plus (B) the total
number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued. For the purposes of the preceding
sentence, the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be outstanding as of a given date
shall be the sum of-(A) the number of shares of Common Stock actually outstanding, (B) the
number of shares of Common Stock into which the then outstanding shares of Series Preferred
could be converted if fully converted on the day immediately preceding the given date, and (C)
the number of shares of Common Stock which could be obtained through the exercise or
conversion of all other rights, options, warrants and convertible securities outstanding on the day
immediately preceding the given date, whether or not then exercised or converted.

(ii) For the purpose of making any adjustment required under
this Section 4(i), the consideration received by the Company for any issue or sale of securities
shall (A) to the extent it consists of cash, be computed at the net amount of cash received by the
Company after deduction of any underwriting or similar commissions, compensation or
concessions paid or allowed by the Company in connection with such issue or sale but without
deduction of any expenses payable by the Company, (B) to the extent it consists of property
other than cash, be computed at the fair value of that property as determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors, and (C) if Additional Shares of Common Stock, Convertible Securities (as
defined in subsection (i)(iii)) or rights or options to purchase either Additional Shares of
Common Stock or Convertible Securities are issued or sold together with other stock or
securities or other assets of the Company for a consideration which covers both, be computed as
the portion of the consideration so received that may be reasonably determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors to be allocable to such Additional Shares of Common Stock, Convertible
Securities or rights or options.

(iii) For the purpose of the adjustment required under this
Section 4(), if the Company issues or sells (i) stock or other securities convertible into,

GDSVF&H1928461.10 13
Additional Shares of Common Stock (such convertible stock or securities being herein referred
to as “Convertible Securities”) or (ii) rights, options or warrants for the purchase of Additional
Shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities and if the Effective Price of such Additional
Shares of Common Stock is less than the Series Preferred Conversion Price, then in each case the
Company shall be deemed to have issued at the time of the issuance of such rights, options,
warrants or Convertible Securities the maximum number of Additional Shares of Common Stock
issuable upon exercise or conversion thereof and to have received as consideration for the
issuance of such shares an amount equal to the total amount of the consideration, if any, received
by the Company for the issuance of such rights, options, warrants or Convertible Securities, plus,
in the case of such rights, options or warrants, the minimum amounts of consideration, if any,
payable to the Company upon the exercise of such rights or options, plus, in the case of
Convertible Securities, the minimum amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Company
(other than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities)
upon the conversion thereof; provided that if in the case of Convertible Securities the minimum
amounts of such consideration cannot be ascertained, but are a function of antidilution or similar
protective clauses, the Company shall be deemed to have received the minimum amounts of
consideration without reference to such clauses; provided further that if the minimum amount of
consideration payable to the Company upon the exercise or conversion of rights, options,
warrants or Convertible Securities is reduced over time or on the occurrence or non-occurrence
of specified events other than by reason of antidilution adjustments, the Effective Price shall be
recalculated using the figure to which such minimum amount of consideration is reduced;
provided further that if the minimum amount of consideration payable to the Company upon the
exercise or conversion of such rights, options, warrants or Convertible Securities is subsequently
increased, the Effective Price shall be again recalculated using the increased minimum amount of
consideration payable to the Company upon the exercise or conversion of such rights, options,
warrants or Convertible Securities. No further adjustment of the Series Preferred Conversion
Price, as adjusted upon the issuance of such rights, options, warrants or Convertible Securities,
shall be made as a result of the actual issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock on the
exercise of any such rights, options or warrants or the conversion of any such Convertible
Securities. If any such rights or options or the conversion privilege represented by any such
Convertible Securities shall expire without having been exercised, the Series Preferred
Conversion Price as adjusted upon the issuance of such rights, options or Convertible Securities
shall be readjusted to the Series Preferred Conversion Price which would have been in effect had
an adjustment been made on the basis that the only Additional Shares of Common Stock so
issued were the Additional Shares of Common Stock, if any, actually issued or sold on the
exercise of such rights or options or rights of conversion of such Convertible Securities, and such
Additional Shares of Common Stock, if any, were issued or sold for the consideration actually
received by the Company upon such exercise, plus the consideration, if any, actually received by
the Company for the granting of all such rights or options, whether or not exercised, plus the
consideration received for issuing or selling the Convertible Securities actually converted, plus
the consideration, if any, actually received by the Company (other than by cancellation of
liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities) on the conversion of such
Convertible Securities, provided that such readjustment shall not retroactively apply to prior
conversions of Series Preferred.

(iv) “Additional Shares of Common Stock” shall mean all
shares of Common Stock issued by the Company or deemed to be issued pursuant to this

GDSVF&H1928461.10 14
Section 4(i) whether or not subsequently reacquired or retired by the Company, other than
(A) shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Series Preferred, provided, however,
that ‘Additional Shares of Common Stock” shall include the shares of Common Stock deemed to
be issued upon the original issuance of the Series C Preferred; (B) shares of Common Stock
and/or options, warrants or other Common Stock purchase rights, and the Common Stock issued
pursuant to such options, warrants or other rights after the Original Issue Date of the Series C
Preferred to employees, officers or directors of, or consultants or advisors to, the Company or
any subsidiary pursuant to stock purchase, stock option plans or other arrangements that are
approved by the Board of Directors, including at least two (2) of the Series Preferred Directors;
(C) shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to the exercise of options, warrants or convertible
securities outstanding as of the Original Issue Date of the Series C Preferred; (D) shares of
Common Stock and/or options, warrants or other Common Stock purchase rights, and the

other than cash pursuant to a merger, consolidation, strategic alliance, acquisition or similar
business combination approved by the Board of Directors, including at least two (2) of the Series
Preferred Directors; (E) shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to any equipment loan or
leasing arrangement, real property leasing arrangement, or debt financing from a bank or similar
financial or lending institution approved by the Board of Directors, including at least two (2) of
the Series Preferred Directors; (F) shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to stock split or
stock dividend approved by the Board of Directors as adjusted for by Section 4(e) or 4(f); and
(G) shares of Common Stock issued which results in conversion of Series Preferred into
Common Stock pursuant to Section 4(I)(i). References to Common Stock in the subsections of
this clause (iv) above shall mean al! shares of Common Stock issued by the Company or deemed
to be issued pursuant to this Section 4(i). The “Effective Price” of Additional Shares of
Common Stock shall mean the quotient determined by dividing the total number of Additional
Shares of Common Stock issued or sold, or deemed to have been issued or sold by the Company
under this Section 4(i), into the aggregate consideration received, or deemed to have been
received by the Company for such issue under this Section 4(i), for such Additional Shares of
Common Stock.

(j) Certificate of Adjustment. In each case of an adjustment or
readjustment of the Series Preferred Conversion Price for the number of shares of Common
Stock or other securities issuable upon conversion of the Series Preferred, if the Series Preferred
is then convertible pursuant to this Section 4, the Company, at its expense, shall compute such
adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the provisions hereof and prepare a certificate
showing such adjustment or readjustment, and shall mail such certificate, by first class mail,
postage prepaid, to each registered holder of Series Preferred at the holder’s address as shown in
the Company’s books, The certificate shall set forth such adjustment or readjustment, showing
in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based, including a statement of
(i) the consideration received or deemed to be received by the Company for any Additional
Shares of Common Stock issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold, (ii) the Series
Preferred Conversion Price at the time in effect, (iii) the number of Additional Shares of
Common Stock and (iv) the type and amount, if any, of other property which at the time would
be received upon conversion of the Series Preferred.

(k) Notices of Record Date. Upon (i) any taking by the Company of
a record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders

GDSVF&H1928461.10 15
thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend or other distribution, or (ii) any Acquisition (as
defined in Section 3(d)) or other capital reorganization of the Company, any reclassification or

or any voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company, the
Company shall give notice to each holder of Series Preferred at least fifteen (15) days prior to the
record date specified therein (or such shorter period approved by a majority of the outstanding
Series Preferred) a notice specifying (A) the date on which any such record is to be taken for the
purpose of such dividend or distribution and a description of such dividend or distribution,
(B) the date on which any such Acquisition, reorganization, reclassification, transfer,
consolidation, merger, Asset Transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to
become effective, and (C) the date, if any, that is to be fixed as to when the holders of record of
Common Stock (or other securities) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock
(or other securities) for securities or other property. deliverable upon such Acquisition,
reorganization, reclassification, transfer, consolidation, merger, Asset Transfer, dissolution,
liquidation or winding up.

((}) Automatic Conversion.

(i) Each share of Series Preferred shall automatically be
converted into shares of Common Stock without the payment of additional consideration by the
holder thereof, based on the then-effective Series Preferred Conversion Price (A) upon the
affirmative election of the Preferred Supermajority, or (B) immediately upon the closing of a
firmly underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, covering the offer and sale of Common Stock for the
account of the Company in which the net cash proceeds to the Company, after the payment of
underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, are at least thirty million dollars
($30,000,000), and where the per share price is not less than four dollars and sixty-two cents
($4.62) per share (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, combinations,
recapitalizations or like events) (a “Qualified IPQ”). Upon such automatic conversion, any
declared and unpaid dividends shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of Section 4(d).

(ii) | Upon the occurrence of either of the events specified in
Section 4(1)(i) above, the outstanding shares of Series Preferred shall be converted automatically
without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates
representing such shares are surrendered to the Company or its transfer agent; provided,
however, that the Company shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion unless the certificates evidencing such shares of
Series Preferred are either delivered to the Company or its transfer agent as provided below, or
the holder notifies the Company or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen
or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Company to indemnify the Company
from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates. Upon the occurrence of such
automatic conversion of the Series Preferred, the holders of Series Preferred shall surrender the
certificates representing such shares at the office of the Company or any transfer agent for the
Series Preferred. Thereupon, there shall be issued and delivered to such holder promptly at such
office and in its name as shown on such surrendered certificate or certificates, a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Series Preferred

GDSVF&H192 8461.10 16
surrendered were convertible on the date on which such automatic conversion occurred, and any
declared and unpaid dividends shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of Section 4(d).

(m) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall
be issued upon conversion of Series Preferred. All shares of Common Stock (including fractions
thereof) issuable upon conversion of more than one share of Series Preferred by a holder thereof
shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the conversion would result in the
issuance of any fractional share. If, after the aforementioned aggregation, the conversion would
result in the issuance of any fractional share, the Company shall, in lieu of issuing any fractional
share, pay cash equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by the Common Stock’s fair
market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) on the date of conversion.

(n) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Company
shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common
Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Series Preferred,
such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding shares of the Series Preferred. If at any time the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all then outstanding shares of the Series Preferred, the Company will take such corporate
action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.

(0) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Section 4
shall be‘in writing and shall be deemed effectively given: (i) upon persona! delivery to the party
to be notified, (ij) when sent by confirmed facsimile if sent during normal] business hours of the
recipient; if not, then on the next business day, (iii) five (5) days after having been sent by
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or (iv) one (1) day after
deposit with a nationally recognized overnight courier, specifying next day delivery, with
verification of receipt. All notices shall be addressed to each holder of record at the address of
such holder appearing on the books of the Company.

(p) Payment of Taxes. The Company will pay all taxes (other than
taxes based upon income) and other governmental charges that may be imposed with respect to
the issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of shares of Series Preferred,
excluding any tax or other charge imposed in connection with any transfer involved in the issue
and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in which the shares of Series
Preferred so converted were registered.

5. REDEMPTION.

(a) | The Company shall be obligated to redeem the Series Preferred as
follows:

(i) The Preferred Supermajority may require the Company, to
the extent it may lawfully do so, to redeem all of the then outstanding Series Preferred in
three (3) annual installments beginning at any time on or after the fifth anniversary of the
Original Issue Date applicable to the Series C Preferred (the date of the first installment of the

GDSVF&H\928461.10 17
redemption being referred to as the “First Redemption Date”), and ending on the date two (2)
years from such First Redemption Date (each, a “Redemption Date”); provided, that the
Company shall receive at least sixty (60) days prior to the First Redemption Date written notice
of such required redemption by the Preferred Supermajority. The Company shall effect such
redemptions on each Redemption Date by paying in cash in exchange for the shares of Series
Preferred to be redeemed (excluding “Excluded Shares” as defined below) on such Redemption
Date a sum equal to the Original Issue Price per share applicable to a series of Series Preferred
(as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like after the
filing date hereof) plus declared and unpaid dividends with respect to such shares. The total
amount to be paid for the Series Preferred is hereinafter referred to as the “Redemption Price.”
The number of shares of Series Preferred that the Company shall be required to redeem on any
one Redemption Date shall be equal to the amount determined by dividing (A) the aggregate
number of shares of Series Preferred outstanding immediately prior to the Redemption Date
(excluding Excluded Shares) by (B) the number of remaining Redemption Dates (including the
Redemption Date to which such calculation applies). Shares subject to redemption pursuant to
this Section 5(a) shall be redeemed from each holder of Series Preferred on a pro rata basis,
based on the number of shares of Series Preferred then held.

(ii) At least thirty (30) days but no more than sixty (60) days
prior to the First Redemption Date, the Company shall send a notice (a “Redemption Notice”) to
all holders of Series Preferred to be redeemed setting forth (A) the Redemption Price for the
shares to be redeemed; and (B) the place at which such holders may obtain payment of the
Redemption Price upon surrender of their share certificates. If the Company does not have
sufficient funds legally available to redeem all shares to be redeemed at the Redemption Date
(including, if applicable, those to be redeemed at the option of the Company), then it shall so
notify such holders and shall redeem such shares pro rata (based on the portion of the aggregate
Redemption Price payable to them) to the extent possible and shall redeem the remaining shares
to be redeemed as soon as sufficient funds are legally available.

(b) Onor prior to each Redemption Date, the Company shal] deposit
the Redemption Price of all shares to be redeemed with a bank or trust company having
ageregate capital and surplus in excess of $100,000,000, as a trust fund, with irrevocable
instructions and authority to the bank or trust company to pay, on and after such Redemption
Date, the Redemption Price of the shares to their respective holders upon the surrender of their
share certificates. Any moneys deposited by the Company pursuant to this Section 5(b) for the
redemption of shares thereafter converted into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 4
hereof no later than the fifth (Sth) day preceding the applicable Redemption Date, along with any
earnings thereon, shall be returned to the Company forthwith upon such conversion. The balance
of any funds deposited by the Company pursuant to this Section 5(b) remaining unclaimed at the
expiration of one (1) year following such Redemption Date, along with any earnings thereon,
shall be returned to the Company promptly upon its written request.

(c) On or after each such Redemption Date, each holder of shares of
Series Preferred to be redeemed shall surrender such holder’s certificates representing such
shares to the Company in the manner and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice, and
thereupon the Redemption Price of such shares shall be payable to the order of the person whose
name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof and each surrendered

GDSVF&H1928461.10 18

certificate shall be canceled. In the event less than all the shares represented by such certificates
are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares. From and
after such Redemption Date, unless there shall have been a default in payment of the Redemption
Price or the Company is unable to pay the Redemption Price due to not having sufficient legally
available funds, all rights of the holder of such shares as holder of Series Preferred (except the
right to receive the Redemption Price without interest upon surrender of their certificates), shall
cease and terminate with respect to such shares; provided that in the event that shares of Series
Preferred are not redeemed due to a default in payment by the Company or because the Company
does not have sufficient legally available funds, such shares of Series Preferred shall remain
outstanding and shall be entitled to all of the rights and preferences provided herein until
redeemed.

(d) In the event of a call for redemption by a Preferred Supermajority,
the Conversion Rights (as defined in Section 4) for such Series Preferred shall terminate as to the
shares designated for redemption at the close of business on the fifth (5") business day preceding
the applicable Redemption Date, unless default is made in payment of the Redemption Price.

(e) If the Company receives, on or prior to the 20th day after the date
of delivery of the Redemption Notice to a holder of Series Preferred, written notice from such
holder that such holder elects to be excluded from the redemption provided in this Section 5,
then the shares of Series Preferred registered on the books of the Company in the name of such
holder at the time of the Company’s receipt of such notice shall thereafter be “Excluded Shares.”
Excluded Shares shall not be redeemed or redeemable pursuant to this Section 5, whether on
such Redemption Date or thereafter. Excluded Shares shall remain outstanding and entitled to
all the rights and preferences provided herein.

V.

A. The liability of the directors of the Company for monetary damages and breach of
