3. Conversion.

The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as follows (the
“Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall not be convertible until
the earlier of (x) November 13, 2012, and (y) an earlier date specified by the vote or written consent
of holders of at least two-thirds of the then outstanding Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class on
an as-converted into Common Stock basis. From and after such date, each share of Preferred Stock
shall be convertible at the option of the holder thereof at the office of the Corporation or any transfer
agent for the Preferred Stock. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible into such number
of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the
Conversion Price (as defined with respect to each series of the Preferred Stock in this Section 3(a)
and as may be adjusted pursuant to the operation of Section 3(d)(ii)) per share then in effect for that
series of Preferred Stock into the per share Conversion Value (as hereinafter defined with respect to
each series of Preferred Stock).

The Conversion Price per share of Series B-1 Preferred shall be initially $0.1839, and
the per share Conversion Value of Series B-1 Preferred shall be $0.1839. The Conversion Price per
share of Series A-5 Preferred shall be initially $0.1839, and the per share Conversion Value of
Series A-5 Preferred shall be $0.1839. The Conversion Price per share of Series A-4 Preferred shall
be initially $0.2391, and the per share Conversion Value of Series A-4 Preferred shall be $0.2391.
The Conversion Price per share of Series A-3 Preferred shall be initially $0.8597, and the per share
Conversion Value of Series A-3 Preferred shall be $0.8597. The Conversion Price per share of
Series A-2 Preferred shall be initially $0.515, and the per share Conversion Value of Series A-2
Preferred shall be $0.515. The Conversion Price per share of Series A-1 Preferred shall be initially
$0.1839, and the per share Conversion Value of Series A-1 Preferred shall be $0.1839. The
Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time
as provided below. The number of shares of Common Stock to which a share of Preferred Stock is
convertible is hereinafter referred to as the Conversion Rate of such share.

(b) Automatic Conversion.

(i) Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into
shares of Common Stock at the then effective Conversion Rate for the respective series of Preferred
Stock upon the earlier of (A) the date specified by the vote or written consent of the holders of at
least two-thirds of the then-outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class on
an as-converted into Common Stock basis, or (B) the closing of a firm commitment underwritten
public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, covering the offer and sale of Common Stock for the account of the Corporation with an
aggregate offering price of not less than $25,000,000. In the event of the automatic conversion of
the Preferred Stock upon a public offering as aforesaid, the person(s) entitled to receive the Common
Stock issuable upon such conversion of the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted
such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of the sale of securities in such public
offering.
(ii) | Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into
one-tenth (1/10) of one share of Common Stock immediately prior to the initial issuance of a share
of Series B-2 Preferred.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be
issued upon conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder
would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to the fair value of such fraction.
Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into full shares of
Common Stock and to receive certificates therefor, he shall surrender the certificate or certificates
therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for the Preferred
Stock, and shall give written notice to the Corporation at such office that he elects to convert the
same. In the event of an automatic conversion pursuant to Section 3(b), the outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically without any further action by the holders of such
shares and whether or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation
or its transfer agent; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue
certificates with respect to shares of Common Stock issuable upon such automatic conversion unless
the certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are either delivered to the Corporation or
its transfer agent as provided above, or the holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that
such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the
Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such
certificates. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after such delivery, or such agreement and
indemnification in the case of a lost certificate, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of
Preferred Stock, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which
such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid and a check payable to the holder in the amount of any cash
amounts payable as the result of a conversion into fractional shares of Common Stock. Such
conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date
of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted; in the case of automatic
conversion pursuant to subsection 3(b)(A), on the date requisite consent or agreement of the
minimum required percentage of holders shall have been obtained; or, in the case of automatic
conversion pursuant to subsection 3(b)(B), immediately prior to the closing of the public offering.
The person or persons entitled to reccive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such
conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of
Common Stock on such date.

Corporation shall issue Additional Shares of Common Stock during the period beginning on the

Original Issue Date and ending on the 24 month anniversary of the Original Issue Date (such date,
the “Ratchet Termination Date”) without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the
then current Conversion Price of the Series B-1 Preferred, then in such event, the then current
Conversion Price of the Series B-1 Preferred shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to the
lowest price per share paid for such issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock. In the event this
Corporation shall issue Additional Shares of Common Stock after the Ratchet Termination Date
without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the then current Conversion Price of
the Series B-1 Preferred, then in such event, the then current Conversion Price of the Series B-|
Preferred shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price determined by multiplying the
then current Conversion Price of the Series B-1 Preferred by a fraction (the “Conversion Price
Fraction’), the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to such issue plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate
consideration received by the Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of Common
Stock so issued would purchase at such then current Conversion Price of the Series B-1 Preferred;
and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to such issue plus the number of such Additional Shares of Common Stock so
issued; and provided further that, for the purposes of this Section 3(d)(ii), all shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of outstanding Preferred Stock and the exercise and/or conversion of
any other outstanding Convertible Securities and all outstanding Options shall be deemed to be
outstanding.

(2) Adjustment of Series A-5 Conversion Price. In the event this
Corporation shall issue Additional Shares of Common Stock after the Original Issue Date without

consideration or for a consideration per share less than the then current Conversion Price of the
Series B-1 Preferred, then in such event, the then current Conversion Price of the Series A-5
Preferred shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price determined by multiplying the
then current Conversion Price of the Series A-5 Preferred by the Conversion Price Fraction. For
purposes of clarity and the avoidance of doubt, the applicable Conversion Prices of the Serics A-5
Preferred, Series A-4 Preferred, Series A-3 Preferred, Series A-2 Preferred and Series A-1 Preferred
will get adjustments pursuant to subparagraphs 3(d)(ii)(2) through 3(d)(ii)(6) during the period
between Original Issue Date and the Ratchet Termination Date.

(3) Adjustment _of Series A-4 Conversion Price. In the event this
Corporation shail issue Additional Shares of Common Stock after the Original Issue Date without

consideration or for a consideration per share less than the then current Conversion Price of the

Preferred shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price determined by multiplying the
then current Conversion Price of the Series A-4 Preferred by the Conversion Price Fraction.
(4) Adjustment of Series A-3 Conversion Price. In the event this
Corporation shall issue Additional Shares of Common Stock after the Original Issue Date without

consideration or for a consideration per share Icess than the then current Conversion Price of the
Series B-1 Preferred, then in such event, the then current Conversion. Price of the Series A-3
Preferred shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price determined by multiplying the
then current Conversion Price of the Series A-3 Preferred by the Conversion Price Fraction.

(5S) Adjustment of Series A-2 Conversion Price. In the event this
Corporation shall issue Additional Shares of Common Stock after the Original Issue Date without

consideration or for a consideration per share less than the then current Conversion Price of the
Series B-1 Preferred, then in such event, the then current Conversion Price of the Series A-2
Preferred shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price determined by multiplying the
then current Conversion Price of the Series A-2 Preferred by the Conversion Price Fraction.

(6) Adjustment of Series A-| Conversion Price. In the event this
Corporation shall issue Additional Shares of Common Stock after the Original Issue Date without

consideration or for a consideration per share less than the then current Conversion Price of the
Series B-l Preferred, then in such event, the then current Conversion Price of the Series A-1
Preferred shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price determined by multiplying the
then current Conversion Price of the Series A-1 Preferred by the Conversion Price Fraction.

(iii) | Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this Section 3(d), the
consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional Shares of Common Stock
shall be computed as follows:

(1) Cash and Property: Such consideration shall:

(A) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the aggregate
amount of cash received by the Corporation excluding amounts paid or payable for accrued interest
or accrued dividends;

(B) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith by the Board
of Directors; and

(C) in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock are issued
in conjunction with other shares or securitics or other assets of the Corporation for consideration
which covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in

Stock deliverable upon exercise of such options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common

10
Stock shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such options or rights were issued and for a
consideration per share equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in
subparagraph 3(d){i1i){1)), if any, received by the Corporation upon the issuance of each such option
or right plus the exercise price provided in each such option or right for the Common Stock or
Preferred Stock covered thereby.

(B) The aggregate maximum number of shares of Common
Stock deliverable upon conversion or in exchange for such convertible or exchangeable securities or
upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or exchangeable
securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof shall be deemed to have been issued at the
time such securities were issued or such options or rights were issued and for a consideration per
share equal to the consideration, if any, received by the Corporation for each share or unit of any
such securities and related options or rights (excluding any cash received on account of accrued

- interest or accrued dividends), plus the additional consideration, if any, to be received by the

Corporation upon the conversion or exchange of each share or unit of such securities or the exercise
of any related options or rights (the consideration in each case to be determined in the manner
provided in subparagraph 3(d)(iii)(1)).

(C)In the event of any change in the number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon exercise of such
options or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such convertible or exchangeable
securities, including, but not limited to, a change resulting from the antidilution provisions thereof,
the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or
computed using such options, rights or securities, shall be recomputed to reflect such change, but no
further adjustment shall be made for the actual issuance of Common Stock or any payment of such
consideration upon the exercise of any such options or rights or the conversion or exchange of such
securitics,

(D) Upon the expiration of any such options or rights, the
termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options or rights
related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Conversion Price of each series of
Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, rights or
securities, shall be recomputed to reflect the issuance of only the number of shares of Common
Stock (and convertible or exchangeable securities which remain in effect) actually issued upon the
conversion or exchange of such securities or upon the exercise of the options or rights related to such
securities.

(E) The number of shares of Common Stock deemed issued
and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to subparagraphs 3(d)(iii)(2)(A) and (B) shall
be appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or expiration of the type described in
either subparagraph 3(d)(iii)(2)(C) or (D).

(iv) Adjustments for Subdivisions, Combinations or Stock Dividends of
Common Stock. In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided (by stock

split, or otherwise), at any time after the Original Issue Date into a greater number of shares of
Common Stock, or the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date
shall declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in Common Stock, the Conversion
Price then in effect for each series of Preferred Stock shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of
such subdivision or stock dividend, be proportionately decreased based on the ratio of (i) the number
of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such subdivision or stock dividend to
(ii) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such subdivision or
stock dividend. In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined or
consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, the
Conversion Price then in effect for each series of Preferred Stock shall, concurrently with the
effectiveness of such combination or consolidation, be proportionately increased on the same basis.

(v) Adjustments for Other Distributions. In the event the Corporation at
any time or from time to time makes, or fixes a record date for the determination of holders of
Common Stock entitled to receive any distribution payable in (1) securities of the Corporation (other
than shares of Common Stock and other than as otherwise adjusted in this Section 3 or as otherwise
provided in Section 1), or (ii) evidences of indebtedness issued by the Corporation or other persons,
or (iit) assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred to in
subparagraph 3(d)(iii)(2), then and in each such event provision shall be made so that the holders of
the Preferred Stock shall receive upon conversion thereof, in addition to the number of shares of
Common Stock receivable thereupon, the amount of such distribution which they would have
received had their Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event and
had they thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to and including the date of
conversion, retained such securities receivable by them as aforesaid during such period, subject to all
other adjustments called for during such period under this Section 3 with respect to the rights of the
holders of the Preferred Stock.

(vi) Adjustments for Recapitalization, Reclassification, Exchange and
Substitution. If at any time or from time to time the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the

Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of any other class or
classes of stock, whether by recapitalization, capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise
(other than a subdivision, combination of shares or merger or sale of assets transaction provided for
above or in Section 2), the Conversion Rate then in effect for each series of Preferred Stock shall,
concurrently with the effectiveness of such recapitalization, reorganization or reclassification, be
proportionately adjusted such that the respective series of Preferred Stock shall be convertible into,
in lieu of the number of shares of Common Stock which the holders thereof would otherwise have
been entitled to receive, a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock equivalent to the
number of shares of Common Stock that would have been subject to receipt by the holders upon
conversion of such series of Preferred Stock immediately before that change. In addition, to the
extent applicable in any reorganization or recapitalization, provision shall be made so that the
holders of the Preferred Stock shal! thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of the Preferred
Stock the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the Corporation or otherwise,
to which a holder of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled on such
reorganization or recapitalization.

(e) No Impairment. The Corporation will not, without the appropriate vote of the

sharcholders under the General Corporation Law or Section 6 of this Article IV, by amendment of its
Articles of Incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger,

12
dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the
observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the
Corporation but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this
Section 3 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect
the Conversion Rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock against impairment.

(f) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Conversion Price or the Conversion Rate of any series of Preferred Stock
pursuant to this Section 3, the Corporation at its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or
readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to each holder of such series of
Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the
facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon the written
request at any time of any holder of a series of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to
such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and readjustments, (ii) the Conversion
Price and the Conversion Rate at the time in effect and applicable to such series, and (111) the number
of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be
received upon the conversion of such series.

(g) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at all
times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock solely
for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock such number of its
shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of ali
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock, in addition to such other remedies as shall be available to the holder of
such Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of
counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such
number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes.

(h) Notices of Record Date. In the event that the Corporation shall propose at any
time:

(i) to declare any dividend or distribution upon its Common Stock,
whether in cash, property, stock or other securities, whether or not a regular cash dividend and
whether or not out of earnings or earned surplus;

(ii) to offer for subscription pro rata to the holders of any class or series of
its stock any additional shares of stock of any class or series or other rights;

(iii) to effect any reclassification or recapitalization of its capital stock
outstanding involving a change in the outstanding capital stock; or

(iv) to undertake a Liquidation;

then, in connection with each such event, the Corporation shall send to the holders of each series of
Preferred Stock:

13
(1) at least 20 days’ prior written notice of the date on which a record
shall be taken for such dividend, distribution or subscription rights (and specifying the date on which
the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled thereto and the amount and character of such
dividend, distribution or right); and

(2) in the case of the matters referred to in (iii) and (iv) above, at least
20 days’ prior written notice of the date when the same shall take place (and specifying the date on
which the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to exchange their Common Stock for securities
or other property deliverable upon the occurrence of such event or the record date for the
determination of such holders if such record date is earlier).

Each such written notice shall be delivered personally or given by first class mail, postage
prepaid, addressed to the holders of each series of Preferred Stock at the address for each such holder
as shown on the books of this Corporation.

(i) Reissuance of Converted Shares. No shares of Preferred Stock which have been
converted into Common Stock after the original issuance thereof shall ever again be reissued and all
such shares of Preferred Stock so converted shall upon such conversion cease to be a part of the
authorized shares of the Corporation.

4. Redemption.

(a) Redemption of Preferred Stock. The Corporation shall not have the right to
call or redeem at any time all or any shares of the Preferred Stock. The holders of the Preferred
Stock shall have redemption rights as follows (the “Redemption Rights”):

(i) At any time after February 15, 2016, upon the election of the holders
of at least two-thirds of the then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock (the “Redemption
Request”), the Corporation shall redeem all issued, outstanding and unconverted shares of Preferred
Stock at the applicable Redemption Price (as defined below) as provided herein from any source of
funds legally available therefor. Subject to the election of the holders of the Preferred Stock
provided above, the Corporation shall redeem all shares of Preferred Stock outstanding as of the date
of such election upon payment of the Redemption Price for the shares so redeemed no later than 45
days after the reccipt of a Redemption Request (the “Redemption Date”). If the funds of the
Corporation legally available for redemption of the Preferred Stock on the Redemption Date are
insufficient to redeem the total number of outstanding shares of Preferred Stock on the Redemption
Date, those funds which are legally available will be used to redeem the maximum number of shares
of the Preferred Stock ratably among the holders of the Preferred Stock. If, and only if, no funds or
insufficient funds are available to the Corporation at the Redemption Date to meet the Corporation’s
redemption obligations pursuant to this Section 4(a)(i), then the Corporation’s obligations to redeem
shares of the Preferred Stock shall continue and at any time thereafter when additional funds of the
Corporation are legally available for the redemption of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation, within
ten (10) business days of the availability of such funds, shall use such funds to redeem the balance of
the shares which the Corporation has become obligated to redeem on the Redemption Date but
which it has not redeemed. The shares of the Preferred Stock that have not been redeemed shall

14
continue to be entitled to the dividend, conversion and other rights, preferences, privileges and
restrictions applicable to each series of Preferred Stock.

(ii) The redemption price for each share of the Series B-1 Preferred
repurchased (the “Series B-1 Redemption Price”) shall be equal to $0.1839 for each such share to be
redeemed (as adjusted for any stock dividends, stocks splits, recapitalizations, combinations,
consolidations, or the like, with respect to the Series B-1 Preferred). The redemption price for each
share of the Series A-5 Preferred repurchased (the “Series A-5 Redemption Price”) shall be equal to
$0.1839 for each such share to be redeemed (as adjusted for any stock dividends, stocks splits,
recapitalizations, combinations, consolidations, or the like, with respect to the Series A-5 Preferred).
The redemption price for each share of the Series A-4 Preferred repurchased (the “Series A-4
Redemption Price”) shall be equal to $0.2391 for each such share to be redeemed (as adjusted for
any stock dividends, stocks splits, recapitalizations, combinations, consolidations, or the like, with
respect to the Series A-4 Preferred). The redemption price for each share of the Series A-3 Preferred
repurchased (the “Series A-3 Redemption Price’’) shall be equal to $0.8597 for each such share to be
redeemed (as adjusted for any stock dividends, stocks splits, recapitalizations, combinations,
consolidations, or the like, with respect to the Series A-2 Preferred). The redemption price for each
share of the Series A-2 Preferred repurchased (the “Series A-2 Redemption Price’’) shall be equal to
$0.515 for each such share to be redeemed (as adjusted for any stock dividends, stocks splits,
recapitalizations, combinations, consolidations, or the like, with respect to the Series A-2 Preferred).
The redemption price for each share of the Serics A-1 Preferred repurchased (the “Series A-]
Redemption Price”) shall be equal to $0.1839 for each such share to be redeemed (as adjusted for
any stock dividends, stocks splits, recapitalizations, combinations, consolidations, or the like, with
respect to the Series A-1 Preferred).

(ii) Within ten (10) business days of the Corporation’s receipt of a
Redemption Request, the Corporation will mail written notice to each holder of record of shares of
each series of Preferred Stock, at the address for such holder as it appears on the stock transfer books
of the Corporation, notifying such holder of the redemption, specifying the Redemption Date upon
which the Corporation shall satisfy the Redemption Request, the applicable Redemption Price, the
place at which payment may be obtained and the date on which such holder’s conversion rights as to
such shares terminate, and calling upon such holder to surrender to the Corporation, in the manner
and at the place designated, its certificate or certificates representing the shares to be redeemed (the
“Redemption Notice”). On or after the Redemption Date, each holder of shares to be redeemed shall
surrender to the Corporation the certificate or certificates representing such shares to be redeemed, in
the manner and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice, and thereupon the Redemption
Price of such shares shall be payable to the order of the person whose name appears on such
certificate or certificates as the owner thereof. In the event that less than all of the shares represented
by any such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed
shares.

(iv) From and after the Redemption Date, unless there shall have been a
default in payment of the Redemption Price, all rights of the holders of the shares thereupon
redeemed, as holders of shares of Preferred Stock (except the right to receive the Redemption Price
upon surrender of their certificate or certificates), shall cease with respect to such shares, and such
shares shall not thereafter be transferred on the books of this Corporation or be deemed to be

15
outstanding for any purpose whatsoever. The shares not redeemed shall remain outstanding and
entitled to all the rights and preferences provided herein.

(v) If there has been a default in the payment of the Redemption Price,
then during the period from the Redemption Date through the date on which such shares of Preferred
Stock are redeemed, the Redemption Price of such shares not redeemed will bear interest at a per-
annum rate equal to the lower of 8% or the highest rate permitted by law.

5. Voting Rights.

(a) Vote Other Than for Directors. Holders of each series of Preferred Stock shall
have full voting rights and powers equal to the voting rights and powers of the holders of Common
Stock, and shall vote together with the holders of Common Stock and not as a separate class except

Section 6 hereof, the holder of each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding shall have one
vote and the holder of each share of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to the number of votes equal to
the number of shares of Common Stock into which such share of Preferred Stock could be converted
at the record date for determination of the shareholders entitled to vote on such matters, or, if no
such record date is established, at the date such vote is taken or any written consent of shareholders
is solicited, such votes to be counted together with all other shares of stock of the Corporation
having general voting power and not separately as a class. Fractional votes by the holders of
Preferred Stock shall not, however, be permitted and any fractional voting rights shall (after
aggregating all shares into which shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder could be converted)
be rounded to the nearest whole number. Holders of Common Stock and Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to notice of any shareholders’ meeting in accordance with the Bylaws of the Corporation.

(b) Voting for Directors. The Board of Directors shall consist of seven (7)
members. At any time as any shares of Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the holders of the shares
of Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class on an as-converted into Common Stock basis, shall be
entitled to elect three (3) directors (the “Preferred Stock Directors”). The holders of Common Stock,
voting as a separate class, shall be entitled to elect two (2) directors (the “Common Directors”). The
holders of the Preferred Stock and Common Stock, with such holders voting together as a single
class, shall be entitled to elect two (2) directors (the “Mutual Directors”). A vacancy on the Board of
Directors occurring because of the death, resignation or removal of a Preferred Stock Director shall
be filled by the vote or written consent of the holders of the Preferred Stock, voting as a separate

written consent of the holders of the Common Stock, voting as a separate class. A vacancy on the
Board of Directors occurring because of the death, resignation or removal of a Mutual Director shall
be filled by the vote or written consent of the holders of the Preferred Stock and Common Stock,
with such holders voting together as a single class. A Preferred Stock Director, a Common Director,
or a Mutual Director may be removed from the Board of Directors with or without cause by the vote
or consent of the holders of the outstanding class or series with voting power entitled to elect him in
accordance with this Section 5(b) and the California Corporations Code.

16
(c) Voting for Directors in the Event of Default under Section 4. In the event that
the Corporation is in default of its obligations to redeem the Preferred Stock, the holders of a

majority of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to elect the Common Directors until such time as the
Company is no longer in default pursuant to Section 4. Thereafter, the Common Directors will be
elected as provided in Section 5(b) above.

6. Covenants.

into Common Stock basis, and holders of at least two-thirds of the Series B-2 Preferred, voting as a
separate class, and a majority of the directors of the Board of Directors determine that such action
should not be deemed a Liquidation.

g Any securities to be delivered to the holders of Preferred Stock pursuant to
Section 2(a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) above shall be valued as follows:

(i) Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar restrictions
on free marketability:

(1) If traded on a securities exchange the value shall be deemed to be

Corporation shall forthwith either:

(i) cause the closing of the applicable transaction to be postponed until

3. Conversion.

The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as follows (the
“Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the
option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share at the office of the
Corporation or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be
convertible into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is
determined by dividing the Conversion Price (as defined with respect to each series of the Preferred
Stock in this Section 3{a) and as may be adjusted pursuant to the operation of Section 3(d)(ii)) per
share then in effect for that series of Preferred Stock into the per share Conversion Value (as
hereinafter defined with respect to each series of Preferred Stock).

The Conversion Price per share of Series B-2 Preferred shall be initially $0.1141, and
the per share Conversion Value of Series B-2 Preferred shall be $0.1141. The Conversion Price per
share of Series B-1' Preferred shall be initially $0.1141, and the per share Conversion Value of
Series B-1' Preferred shall be $0.1141. The Conversion Price per share of Series A-5! Preferred shall
be initially $0.1141, and the per share Conversion Value of Series A-5’ Preferred shall be $0.1141.
The Conversion Price per share of Series A-4' Preferred shall be initially $0.1141, and the per share
Conversion Value of Series A-4' Preferred shall be $0.1141. The Conversion Price per share of
Series A-3' Preferred shall be initially $0.1141, and the per share Conversion Valuc of Series A-3'
Preferred shall be $0.1141. The Conversion Price per share of Series A-2! Preferred shall be initially
$0.1141, and the per share Conversion Value of Series A-2' Preferred shall be $0.1141. The
Conversion Price per share of Series A-1' Preferred shall be initially $0.1141, and the per share
Conversion Value of Series A-1' Preferred shall be $0.1141. The Conversion Price of each series of
Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided below. The number of
shares of Common Stock to which a share of Preferred Stock is convertible is hereinafter referred to
as the Conversion Rate of such share.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be
converted into shares of Common Stock at the then effective Conversion Rate for the respective
series of Preferred Stock upon the earlier of (A) the date specified by the vote or written consent of
the holders of at least two-thirds of the then-outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, voting as a
separate class on an as-converted into Common Stock basis, and the holders of at least two-thirds of
the Series B-2 Preferred, voting as a separate class or (B) the closing of a firm commitment
underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended, covering the offer and sale of Common Stock for the account of the
Corporation with an aggregate offering price of not less than $25,000,000. In the event of the

22
automatic conversion of the Preferred Stock upon a public offering as aforesaid, the person(s)
entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of the Preferred Stock shall not
be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of the sale
of securities in such public offering.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be
issued upon conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder
would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to the fair value of such fraction.
Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into full shares of
Common Stock and to receive certificates therefor, he shall surrender the certificate or certificates
therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for the Preferred
Stock, and shall give written notice to the Corporation at such office that he elects to convert the
same. In the event of an automatic conversion pursuant to Section 3(b), the outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically without any further action by the holders of such
shares and whether or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation
or its transfer agent; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue
certificates with respect to shares of Common Stock issuable upon such automatic conversion unless
the certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are either delivered to the Corporation or
its transfer agent as provided above, or the holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that
such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the
Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such
certificates. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after such delivery, or such agreement and
indemnification in the case of a lost certificate, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of
Preferred Stock, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which
such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid and a check payable to the holder in the amount of any cash
amounts payable as the result of a conversion into fractional shares of Common Stock. Such
conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date
of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted; in the case of automatic
conversion pursuant to subsection 3(b)(A), on the date requisite consent or agreement of the
minimum required percentage of holders shall have been obtained; or, in the case of automatic
conversion pursuant to subsection 3(b)(B), immediately prior to the closing of the public offering.
The person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such
conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of
Common Stock on such date.

shall declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in Common Stock, the Conversion
Price then in effect for each series of Preferred Stock shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of
such subdivision or stock dividend, be proportionately decreased based on the ratio of (i) the number
of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such subdivision or stock dividend to
(ii) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such subdivision or
stock dividend. In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined or
consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, the
Conversion Price then in effect for each series of Preferred Stock shall, concurrently with the
effectiveness of such combination or consolidation, be proportionately increased on the same basis.

provided in Section 1), or (4i) evidences of indebtedness issued by the Corporation or other persons,
or (iii) assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not constituting Options, then and in
each such event provision shall be made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock shall receive upon
conversion thereof, in addition to the number of shares of Common Stock receivable thereupon, the
amount of such distribution which they would have received had their Preferred Stock been
converted into Common Stock on the date of such event and had they thereafter, during the period
from the date of such event to and including the date of conversion, retained such securities
receivable by them as aforesaid during such period, subject to all other adjustments called for during
such period under this Section 3 with respect to the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock.

(vi) Adjustments for Recapitalization, Reclassification, Exchange and
Substitution. If at any time or from time to time the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the

Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of any other class or
classes of stock, whether by recapitalization, capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise
(other than a subdivision, combination of shares or merger or sale of assets transaction provided for
above or in Section 2), the Conversion Rate then in effect for each series of Preferred Stock shall,
concurrently with the effectiveness of such recapitalization, reorganization or reclassification, be
proportionately adjusted such that the respective series of Preferred Stock shall be convertible into,
in lieu of the number of shares of Common Stock which the holders thereof would otherwise have
been entitled to receive, a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock equivalent to the
number of shares of Common Stock that would have been subject to receipt by the holders upon
conversion of such series of Preferred Stock immediately before that change. In addition, to the
extent applicable in any reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other event, provision
shall be made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon
conversion of the Preferred Stock the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the
Corporation or otherwise, to which a holder of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion would
have been entitled on such reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other event.

(e) No Impairment. The Corporation will not, without the appropriate vote of the
shareholders under the General Corporation Law and Section 6 of this Article IV, by amendment of

29
its Articles of Incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger,
dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the
observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the
Corporation but will at ali times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this
Section 3 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect
the Conversion Rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock against impairment.

(f) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Conversion Price or the Conversion Rate of any series of Preferred Stock
pursuant to this Section 3, the Corporation at its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or
readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to each holder of such series of
Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the
facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon the written
request at any time of any holder of a series of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to
such holder a like certificate setting forth (1) such adjustments and readjustments, (ii) the Conversion
Price and the Conversion Rate at the time in effect and applicable to such series, and (iii) the number
of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be
received upon the conversion of such series.

(g) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at all
times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock solely

for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock such number of its
shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock, in addition to such other remedies as shall be available to the holder of
such Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of
counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such
number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes. ,

(h) Notices of Record Date. In the event that the Corporation shall propose at any

the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled thereto and the amount and character of such
dividend, distribution or right); and

(2) in the case of the matters referred to in (iii) and (iv) above, at least

provided above, the Corporation shall redeem all shares of Preferred Stock outstanding as of the date
of such election upon payment of the Redemption Price for the shares so redeemed no later than 45
days after the receipt of a Redemption Request (the “Redemption Date”). If the funds of the
Corporation legally available for redemption of the Preferred Stock on the Redemption Date are
insufficient to redeem the total number of outstanding shares of Preferred Stock on the Redemption
Date, those funds which are legally available will be used to redeem the maximum number of shares
of the Preferred Stock ratably among the holders of the Preferred Stock in the following order (1)
two-thirds of the shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock held by each holder of Series B-2 Preferred
Stock, (2) all remaining outstanding shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock held by each holder of

time thereafter when additional funds of the Corporation are legally available for the redemption of

31
the Preferred Stock, the Corporation, within ten (10) business days of the availability of such funds,
shall use such funds to redeem the balance of the shares which the Corporation has become obligated
to redeem on the Redemption Date but which it has not redeemed. The shares of the Preferred Stock
that have not been redeemed shall continue to be entitled to the dividend, conversion and other
rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions applicable to each series of Preferred Stock.

(ii) The redemption price for each share of the Series B-2 Preferred
repurchased (the “Series B-2 Redemption Price”) shall be equal to $0.1712 for each such share to be
redeemed (as adjusted for any stock dividends, stocks splits, recapitalizations, combinations,
consolidations, or the like, with respect to the Series B-2 Preferred). The redemption price for each

combinations, consolidations, or the like, with respect to the Series A-4! Preferred). The redemption
price for each share of the Series A-3' Preferred repurchased (the “Series A-3' Redemption Price”)
shall be equal to $0.8597 for each such share to be redeemed (as adjusted for any stock dividends,
stocks splits, recapitalizations, combinations, consolidations, or the like, with respect to the Series A-
2' Preferred). The redemption price for cach share of the Series A-2' Preferred repurchased (the
“Series A-2° Redemption Price”) shall be equal to $0.515 for each such share to be redecmed (as
adjusted for any stock dividends, stocks splits, recapitalizations, combinations, consolidations, or the
like, with respect to the Series A-2' Preferred). The redemption price for each share of the Series A-
1' Preferred repurchased (the “Series A-1' Redemption Price”) shall be equal to $0.1839 for each
such share to be redeemed (as adjusted for any stock dividends, stocks splits, recapitalizations,
combinations, consolidations, or the like, with respect to the Series A-1! Preferred).

(iii) Within ten (10) business days of the Corporation’s receipt of a
Redemption Request, the Corporation will mail written notice to each holder of record of shares of
each series of Preferred Stock, at the address for such holder as it appears on the stock transfer books
of the Corporation, notifying such holder of the redemption, specifying the Redemption Date upon
which the Corporation shall satisfy the Redemption Request, the applicable Redemption Price, the
place at which payment may be obtained and the date on which such holder’s conversion rights as to
such shares terminate, and calling upon such holder to surrender to the Corporation, in the manner
and at the place designated, its certificate or certificates representing the shares to be redeemed (the
“Redemption Notice”). On or after the Redemption Date, each holder of shares to be redeemed shall
surrender to the Corporation the certificate or certificates representing such shares to be redeemed, in
the manner and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice, and thereupon the Redemption
Price of such shares shall be payable to the order of the person whose name appears on such
certificate or certificates as the owner thereof. In the event that less than all of the shares represented
by any such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed
shares.

32
(iv) From and after the Redemption Date, unless there shall have been a
default in payment of the Redemption Price, all rights of the holders of the shares thereupon
redeemed, as holders of shares of Preferred Stock (except the right to receive the Redemption Price
upon surrender of their certificate or certificates), shall cease with respect to such shares, and such
shares shall not thereafter be transferred on the books of this Corporation or be deemed to be
outstanding for any purpose whatsoever. The shares not redeemed shall remain outstanding and
entitled to all the rights and preferences provided herein.

(v) If there has been a default in the payment of the Redemption Price,
then during the period from the Redemption Date through the date on which such shares of Preferred
Stock are redeemed, the Redemption Price of such shares not redeemed will bear interest at a per-
annum rate equal to the lower of 8% or the highest rate permitted by law.

5. Voting Rights.

(a) Vote Other Than for Directors. Holders of each series of Preferred Stock shall
have full voting rights and powers equal to the voting rights and powers of the holders of Common
Stock, and shall vote together with the holders of Common Stock and not as a separate class except
as otherwise required by law, or provided herein. Except as otherwise required by law or by
Section 6 hereof, the holder of each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding shall have one
vote and the holder of each share of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to the number of votes equal to
the number of shares of Common Stock into which such share of Preferred Stock could be converted
at the record date for determination of the shareholders entitled to vote on such matters, or, if no
such record date is established, at the date such vote is taken or any written consent of shareholders
is solicited, such votes to be counted together with all other shares of stock of the Corporation
having general voting power and not separately as a class. Fractional votes by the holders of
Preferred Stock shall not, however, be permitted and any fractional voting rights shall (after
aggregating all shares into which shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder could be converted)
be rounded to the nearest whole number. Holders of Common Stock and Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to notice of any shareholders’ meeting in accordance with the Bylaws of the Corporation.

(b) Voting for Directors. The Board of Directors shall consist of seven (7)
members. At any time as any shares of Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the holders of the shares
of Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class on an as-converted into Common Stock basis, shall be
entitled to elect four (4) directors (the “Preferred Stock Directors”). The holders of Common Stock,
voting as a separate class, shall be entitled to elect two (2) directors (the “Common Directors”). The
holders of the Preferred Stock and Common Stock, with such holders voting together as a single
class, shall be entitled to elect one (1) director (the “Mutual Director”). A vacancy on the Board of
Directors occurring because of the death, resignation or removal of a Preferred Stock Director shall
be filled by the vote or written consent of the holders of the Preferred Stock, voting as a separate
class on an as-converted into Common Stock basis. A vacancy on the Board of Directors occurring
because of the death, resignation or removal of a Common Director shall be filled by the vote or
written consent of the holders of the Common Stock, voting as a separate class. A vacancy on the
Board of Directors occurring because of the death, resignation or removal of a Mutual Director shall
be filled by the vote or written consent of the holders of the Preferred Stock and Common Stock,
with such holders voting together as a single class on an as-converted to Common Stock basis. A

33
Preferred Stock Director, a Common Director, or a Mutual Director may be removed from the Board
of Directors with or without cause by the vote or consent of the holders of the outstanding class or
series with voting power entitled to elect him in accordance with this Section 5(b) and the California
Corporations Code.

(c) Voting for Directors in the Event of Default under Section 4. In the event that
the Corporation is in default of its obligations to redeem the Preferred Stock, the holders of a

majority of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to elect the Common Directors until such time as the
Company is no longer in default pursuant to Section 4. Thereafter, the Common Directors will be
elected as provided in Section 5(b) above.

6. Covenants.

In addition to any other rights provided by law, at any such time as at least 6,000,000
shares of Preferred Stock remain outstanding (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends or
distributions, recapitalizations, and similar events), the Corporation shall not (whether by merger,
consolidation or otherwise), without first obtaining the affirmative vote or written consent of the
holders of at least two-thirds of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting as a separate
class on an as-converted into Common Stock basis, and the holders of at least two-thirds of the then
outstanding shares of Series B-2 Preferred, voting as a separate class:

(a) amend or waive any provision of, or add any provision to, the Corporation’s
Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws, as amended, if such action would amend or waive, alter or
change the preferences, rights, privileges or powers of, or the restrictions provided for the benefit of
any series of the Preferred Stock; -

(b) authorize or issue shares of any series or class of stock having any preference
or priority (including, but not limited to, voting, dividends, redemption, conversion or liquidation)
superior to or on a parity with any such preference or priority of the Scries A-1' Preferred, the Series
A-2' Preferred, the Series A-3' Preferred, the Series A-4' Preferred, the Series A-5! Preferred, the
Series B-1' Preferred or the Series B-2 Preferred, or authorize shares of stock of any class or any
bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations convertible into or exchangeable for, or having option
rights to purchase, any shares of stock of the Corporation having any preference or priority
(including, but not limited to, voting, dividends, redemption, conversion or liquidation) superior to
or on a parity with any such preference or priority of the Series A-1' Preferred, the Series A-2'
Preferred, the Series A-3! Preferred, the Series A-4' Preferred, the Series A-5' Preferred, the Series
B-1' Preferred or the Series B-2 Preferred;

(c) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire (or pay into or set aside for a sinking
fund for such purpose), any of the Common Stock or the Preferred Stock; provided, however, that
this restriction shall not apply to the repurchase of shares of Common Stock at cost from directors,
officers, consultants or employees of the Corporation or any subsidiary pursuant to equity incentive
agreements approved by the Corporation's Board of Directors under which the Corporation has the
option to repurchase such shares upon the termination of employment or services, or pursuant to a
contractual right of first refusal, or pursuant to the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation;

34
(d) effect a recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation of the
Corporation with or into any other corporation or corporations, partnership or partnerships, limited
liability company or companies or any other entity or entities (but excluding any merger effected
solely for the purpose of reincorporating in another state), or the merger of any other corporation or
corporations, partnership or partnerships, limited liability company or companies or any other entity
or entities into the Corporation; a sale, license, grant of security interest in or transfer of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Corporation or its intellectual property or any similar transaction;
a share exchange; the undertaking by the Corporation of a transaction or series of transactions or an
acquisition in which more than 50% of the voting power of the Corporation is disposed of;

(e) increase or decrease the authorized number of shares of Common Stock or
Preferred Stock or any series thereof;

(f) authorize or take any action that would result in the payment or declaration of
any dividend or distribution on any shares of the Corporation’s equity securities;

(g) permit any subsidiary of the Corporation in which the Corporation holds a
controlling voting interest to (i) sell or issue any equity security to any party other than the
Corporation; or (ii) grant a security interest in all or substantially all its assets or intellectual
property; or

(h) authorize or take any action with respect to a Liquidation; or
(1) create any direct or indirect subsidiary.
7. Common Stock,

(a) Dividend Rights. Subject to the prior rights of holders of all classes of stock
at the time outstanding having prior rights as to dividends, the holders of the Common Stock shall be
entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors, out of any assets of the
Corporation legally available therefor, such dividends as may be declared from time to time by the
Board of Directors.

(b) Liquidation Rights. Upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation, the assets of the Corporation shall be distributed as provided in Section 2(e) above.

(c) Redemption. The Common Stock is not redeemable at the option of the
holder thereof.

(d) Voting Rights. The holder of each share of Common Stock shall have the
right to one vote, and shall be entitled to notice of any stockholders’ meeting in accordance with the

Corporations Code, subject only to the applicable limits set forth in Section 204 of the California
Corporations Code with respect to actions for breach of duty to the Corporation and its shareholders.

eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the
Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation

shareholders of the Corporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the

to provide indemnification) through Bylaw provisions, agreements with such agents or other
persons, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, in excess of the indemnification
and advancement otherwise permitted by Section 317 of the Corporations Code. Any amendment,
repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article V shall not adversely affect any
right or protection of any director, officer or other agent of the Corporation existing at the time of
such amendment, repeal or modification.

expectancy of the Corporation in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any Excluded
Opportunity. An "Excluded Opportunity" is any matter, transaction or interest that is presented to,
or acquired, created or developed by, or which otherwise comes into the possession of, (i) any
director of the Corporation who is not an employee of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, or
(11) any holder of Preferred Stock or any partner, member, director, shareholder, employee or agent
of any such holder, other than someone who is an employee of the Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries (collectively, "Covered Persons"), unless such matter, transaction or interest is presented
to, or acquired, created or developed by, or otherwise comes into the possession of, a Covered
Person expressly and solely in such Covered Person's capacity as a director of the Corporation

36
