Amalfi Semiconductor, Inc., a Delaware corporation.

2. The Certificate of Incorporation of this corporation was originally filed with the
Secretary of State of Delaware on January 22, 2003.

3. The Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of this corporation shall
be amended and restated to read in full as follows:

ARTICLE I
“The name of this corporation is Amalfi Semiconductor, Inc., (the “Corporation’).
ARTICLE II

The address of the Corporation’s registered office in the State of Delaware is 3500 South
Dupont Highway, City of Dover, County of Kent. The name of its registered agent at such
address is Incorporating Services, Ltd.

ARTICLE HI

The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which
corporations may be organized under the Delaware General Corporation Law.

ARTICLE IV

Immediately upon the filing of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation in
the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the “Effective Time”), each share of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Outstanding Common
Stock’), automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall be
converted and reconstituted into one-fifth (1/Sth) of a share (the “Reverse Stock Split’). No
fractional shares shal] be issued upon the Reverse Stock Split of any share or shares of the
Outstanding Common Stock. The number of shares issuable upon the Reverse Stock Split shall
be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Outstanding Common Stock held by
each holder. If the Reverse Stock Split would result in any fractional share, such fractional share
shall be rounded to the nearest whole share, with 0.5 rounded up. Every share number, dollar
amount, conversion rate and other provision contained in this Amended and Restated Certificate

OHS West:260685385.4

of Incorporation (including those relating to the rights, preferences and privileges of the Preferred
Stock) has been adjusted for the Reverse Stock Split.

Immediately upon the Effective Time, (i) each share of Series A Preferred Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Series A Stock”), automatically and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall be reclassified as and converted into
0.23857556 shares of Series B-3 Preferred Stock, (ii) each share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Series A-1 Stock”), automatically and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall be reclassified as and converted into
0.25217563 shares of Series B-3 Preferred Stock, (iii) each share of Series B Preferred Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Series B Stock”), automatically and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall be reclassified as and converted into
0.25996524 shares of Series B-3 Preferred Stock, (iv) each share of Series B-1 Preferred Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Series B-1 Stock”), automatically and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall be reclassified as and converted into
0.27099125 shares of Series B-3 Preferred Stock and (v) each share of Series B-2 Preferred Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Series B-2 Stock”), automatically and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall be reclassified as and converted into 0.2
share of Series B-3 Preferred Stock (such reclassifications and conversions, the “Preferred Stock
Recapitalization”). Each holder of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Series A, Series A-1, Series B, Series B-1 or
Series B-2 Stock (the “Old Preferred Certificates”) will be entitled to receive, upon surrender of
such Old Preferred Certificates to the Corporation for cancellation, a certificate or certificates
(the “New Series B-3 Certificate,” whether one or more) representing the number of shares of
Series B-3 Preferred Stock into which and for which the shares of Series A, Series A-1, Series B,
Series B-] or Series B-2 Stock formerly represented by such Old Preferred Certificates so
surrendered are reclassified under the terms hereof. From and after the Effective Time, Old
Preferred Certificates shall represent only a right to receive New Series B-3 Certificates pursuant
to the provisions hereof, and outstanding securities of the Corporation exercisable for or
convertible into Series A, Series A-1, Series B, Series B-1 or Series B-2 Stock shall represent
only a right to receive upon exercise or convertible thereof the shares of Series B-3 Preferred
Stock as determined pursuant to the provisions hereof. No fractional shares shall be issued upon
the conversion of any share or shares of the Series A, Series A-1, Series B, Series B-1 or
Series B-2 Stock, and the number of shares of Series B-3 Preferred Stock to be issued shall be
rounded to the nearest whole share, with 0.5 rounded up. The number of shares issuable upon
the conversion provided herein shall be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of
Series A, Series A-1, Series B, Series B-1 or Series B-2 Stock the holder is at the time converting
into Series B-3 Preferred Stock and the number of shares of Series B-3 Preferred Stock issuable
upon such aggregate conversion. Every share number, dollar amount, conversion rate and other
provision contained in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including those
relating to the rights, preferences and privileges of the Preferred Stock) has been adjusted for the
Preferred Stock Recapitalization.

(A) Classes of Stock. The Corporation is authorized to issue two classes of stock to
be designated, respectively, common stock and preferred stock. The total number of shares
which the Corporation is authorized to issue is 230,071,195 shares, each with a par value of

OHS West:260685385.4
15931-1 -2-
$0.0001 per share, 90,000,000 shares shall be Common Stock (“Common Stock”) and
140,071,195 shares shall be Preferred Stock.

(B) Rights, Preferences and Restrictions of Preferred Stock. The Preferred Stock
authorized by this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Restated

Certificate”) may be issued from time to time in one or more series. The first series of Preferred
Stock shall be designated “Series A Preferred Stock” and shall consist of 6,025,319 shares. The
second series of Preferred Stock shall be designated “Series A-] Preferred Stock” and shall
consist of 9,810,471 shares. The third series of Preferred Stock shall be designated “Series B
Preferred Stock” and shall consist of 15,540,000 shares. The fourth series of Preferred Stock

of 30,000,000 shares. The sixth series of Preferred Stock shall be designated “Series B-3
Preferred Stock” and shall consist of 15,753,531 shares. The seventh series of Preferred Stock
shall be designated “Series C Preferred Stock” and shall consist of 51,091,874 shares. The
rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions granted to and imposed on the Series B-3 and
Series C Preferred Stock are as set forth below in this Article IV(B). The Series B-3 and Series C
Preferred Stock are together defined herein as “‘Preferred Stock.”

1. Dividend Provisions. The holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to receive dividends (the “Series C Dividends”) out of any assets legally
available therefor, prior and in preference to any declaration or payment of any dividend (payable
other than in Common Stock or other securities and rights convertible into or entitling the holder
thereof to receive, directly or indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock of the Corporation,
provided that an adjustment to the respective Conversion Price (as defined below) of such other
securities or rights has been made in accordance with Section 4(d)(ii) below) on the Series B-3
Preferred Stock and Common Stock of the Corporation, at the rate of $0.02826 per share (as
adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reclassification or the like) per annum on each
outstanding share of Series C Preferred Stock, payable quarterly when, as and if declared by the
Board of Directors. Such dividends shall not be cumulative. Subject to the payment of the
Series C Dividends as set forth in the previous sentence and the prior written consent of holders
of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series C Preferred Stock, the holders of shares of
Series B-3 Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive dividends, out of any assets legally
available therefor, prior and in preference to any declaration or payment of any dividend (payable
other than in Common Stock or other securities and rights convertible into or entitling the holder
thereof to receive, directly or indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock of the Corporation,
provided that an adjustment to the respective Conversion Price (as defined below) of such other
securities or rights has been made in accordance with Section 4(d)(ii) below) on the Common
Stock of the Corporation, at the rate of $0.05713 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock
dividends, reclassification or the like) per annum on each outstanding share of Series B-3
Preferred Stock, payable quarterly when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors. Such
dividends shall not be cumulative. After payment of such dividends and the prior written consent
of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series C Preferred Stock, any additional
dividends shall be distributed among the holders of Series B-3 and Series C Preferred Stock and
Common Stock pro rata based on the number of shares of Common Stock then held by each
holder (assuming conversion of ali such Preferred Stock into Common Stock).

15931-1 -3-
2. Liquidation.

(a) Series C Preference. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution
or winding up of the Corporation, either voluntary or involuntary, the holders of the Series C
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any distribution of any of
the assets of the Corporation to the holders of the Series B-3 Preferred Stock and Common Stock
by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount per share equal to $0.471 per share (as adjusted
for stock splits, stock dividends, reclassification or the like) for each share of Series C Preferred
Stock then held by them, plus declared but unpaid dividends. If, upon the occurrence of such
event, the assets and funds thus distributed among the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock
shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full aforesaid preferential
amounts, then the entire assets and funds of the Corporation legally available for distribution
shall be distributed ratably among the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock in proportion to the
preferential amount each such holder is otherwise entitled to receive.

(b) Series B-3 Preference. Upon the completion of the distribution
required by Section 2(a) above, in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation, either voluntary or involuntary, the holders of the Series B-3 Preferred Stock shall
be entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any distribution of any of the assets of the
Corporation to the holders of Common Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount
per share equal to $0.9522 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reclassification
or the like) for each share of Series B-3 Preferred Stock then held by them, plus declared but
unpaid dividends. If, upon the occurrence of such event, the assets and funds thus distributed
among the holders of the Series B-3 Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit the payment
to such holders of the full aforesaid preferential amounts, then the entire remaining assets and
funds of the Corporation legally available for distribution shall be distributed ratably among the
holders of the Series B-3 Preferred Stock in proportion to the preferential amount each such
holder is otherwise entitled to receive.

(c) Remaining Assets. Upon the completion of the distributions
required by Sections 2(a) and (b) above, the remaining assets of the Corporation available for
distribution to stockholders shall be distributed among the holders of the Series B-3 and Series C
Preferred Stock and the Common Stock pro rata based on the number of shares of Common
Stock held by each (assuming conversion of all such Preferred Stock into Common Stock).

(d) Certain Acquisitions.

(i) Deemed Liquidation. For purposes of this Section 2, a
liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation shall be deemed to occur if the
Corporation shall sell, convey, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its property or
business or merge with or into or consolidate with any other corporation, limited liability
company or other entity (other than a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation), including
any transaction or series of transactions, which results in the transfer of 50% or more of the
outstanding voting securities of the Corporation (any such transaction or series of transactions, a
“Liquidation Transaction”), provided that none of the following shall be considered a Liquidation
Transaction: (i) a merger effected exclusively for the purpose of changing the domicile of the

OHS West:260685385.4
15931-1 -4-
Corporation, (ii) a bona fide equity financing in which the Corporation is the surviving
corporation, or (iii) a transaction in which the stockholders of the Corporation immediately prior
to the transaction own, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the voting power of the surviving
corporation, in the same relative proportions, following the transaction.

(ii) | Notwithstanding Sections 2(a), (b) and (c) above, for
purposes of determining the amount each holder of shares of Preferred Stock is entitled to receive
with respect to a liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation or a Liquidation
Transaction, each such holder of shares of a series of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have
converted (regardless of whether such holder actually converted) such holder’s shares of such
series into shares of Common Stock immediately prior to the liquidation, dissolution, or winding
up of the Corporation or Liquidation Transaction, as applicable, if, as a result of an actual
conversion, such holder would receive, in the aggregate, an amount greater than the amount that
would be distributed to such holder if such holder did not convert such series of Preferred Stock
into shares of Common Stock. If any such holder shall be deemed to have converted shares of a
series of Preferred Stock into Common Stock pursuant to this paragraph, then the holder of such
series shall not be entitled to receive any other distribution with respect to such series of
Preferred Stock.

(iii) Valuation of Consideration. In the event of a deemed
liquidation as described in Section 2(d)(1) above, if the consideration received by the Corporation
is other than cash, its value will be deemed its fair market value. Any securities shall be valued
as follows:

(A) — Securities not subject to investment letter or other
similar restrictions on free marketability:

(1) If traded on a securities exchange, the value
shall be based on a formula approved by the Board of Directors and derived from the closing
prices of the securities on such exchange over a specified time period;

(2) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value
shall be based on a formula approved by the Board of Directors and derived from the closing bid
or sales prices (whichever is applicable) of such securities over a specified time period; and

(3) _ If there is no active public market, the value
shall be the fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(B) The method of valuation of securities subject to
investment letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely
by virtue of a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an
appropriate discount from the market value determined as specified above in Section 2(d)(iii)(A)
to reflect the approximate fair market value thereof, as unanimously determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors.

OHS West:260685385.4
15931-1 -5-
(iv) Notice of Liquidation Transaction. The Corporation
shall give each holder of record of Series B-3 or Series C Preferred Stock written notice of any

impending Liquidation Transaction not later than 10 days prior to the stockholders’ meeting
called to approve such Liquidation Transaction, or 10 days prior to the closing of such
Liquidation Transaction, whichever is earlier, and shall also notify such holders in writing of the
final approval of such Liquidation Transaction. The first of such notices shall describe the
material terms and conditions of the impending Liquidation Transaction and the provisions of
this Section 2, and the Corporation shall thereafter give such holders prompt notice of any
material changes. Unless such notice requirements are waived, the Liquidation Transaction shall
not take place sooner than 10 days after the Corporation has given the first notice provided for
herein or sooner than 10 days after the Corporation has given notice of any material changes
provided for herein. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Restated Certificate, all notice
periods or requirements in this Restated Certificate may be shortened or waived, either before or
after the action for which notice is required, upon the written consent of the holders of at least a
majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (voting together as a
single class and on an as converted basis) that are entitled to such notice rights.

(v) Effect of Noncompliance. In the event the requirements of
this Section 2(d) are not complied with, the Corporation shall forthwith either cause the closing
of the Liquidation Transaction to be postponed until the requirements of this Section 2 have been
complied with, or cancel such Liquidation Transaction, in which event the rights, preferences,
privileges and restrictions of the holders of Series B-3 and Series C Preferred Stock shall revert
to and be the same as such rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions existing immediately
prior to the date of the first notice referred to in Section 2(d)(iv).

3, Redemption.

(a) Redemption Date and Price. At any time after July 31, 2014, but
within 30 days after receipt by the Corporation of a written request (a “Redemption Election’)
from the holders of not less than a majority of the then outstanding Preferred Stock, voting
together as a single class and on an as converted basis, that all of the shares of such stock be
redeemed, the Corporation shall, to the extent it may lawfully do so, redeem the number of shares
specified in the Redemption Election in three equal annual installments (the date of each
installment being a “Redemption Date”) in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
Section 3 by paying in cash therefor a sum per share equal to $0.9522 per share of Series B-3
Preferred Stock and $0.471 per share of Series C Preferred Stock (each as adjusted for stock
splits, stock dividends, reclassifications or the like), plus all declared or accumulated but unpaid
dividends on such shares (the “Redemption Price”).

(b) Number of Shares. The number of shares of Preferred Stock that
the Corporation shall be required under this Section 3 to redeem on each Redemption Date shall
be equal to the amount determined by dividing (i) the aggregate number of shares of such series
of Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Redemption Date by (ii) the number of
remaining Redemption Dates (including the Redemption Date to which such calculation applies).
Any redemption effected pursuant to this Section 3 shall be made on a pro rata basis among the

OHS West:260685385.4
15931-1 -6-
holders of the series of Preferred Stock based upon the total Redemption Price applicable to each
holder’s shares of Preferred Stock.

(c) Procedure. Within 15 days following its receipt of the
Redemption Election, the Corporation shall mail a written notice, first class postage prepaid, to
each holder of record (at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on
which notice is given) of Preferred Stock at the address last shown on the records of the
Corporation for such holder, notifying such holder of the redemption to be effected, specifying
the number of shares and series to be redeemed from such holder, the Redemption Date, the
applicable Redemption Price, the place at which payment may be obtained and calling upon such
holder to surrender to the Corporation, in the manner and at the place designated, such holder’s
certificate or certificates representing the shares to be redeemed (the “Redemption Notice”).
Except as provided in Section 3(c), on or after each Redemption Date, each holder of Preferred
Stock to be redeemed shall surrender to the Corporation the certificate or certificates representing
such shares, in the manner and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice, and thereupon
the Redemption Price of such shares shall be payable to the order of the person whose name
appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof and each surrendered certificate
shall be cancelled. In the event less than all the shares represented by any such certificate are
redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares.

(d) Effect of Redemption; Insufficient Funds. From and after each
Redemption Date, unless there shall have been a default in payment of the Redemption Price, all

rights of the holders of the shares of Preferred Stock designated for redemption on such
Redemption Date in the Redemption Notice (except the right to receive the Redemption Price
without interest upon surrender of their certificate or certificates) shall cease with respect to such
shares, and such shares shall not thereafter be transferred on the books of the Corporation or be
deemed to be outstanding for any purpose whatsoever. If the funds of the Corporation legally
available for redemption of shares of Preferred Stock on any Redemption Date are insufficient to
redeem the total number of shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such date, those funds
which are legally available will be used to redeem the maximum possible number of such shares
ratably among the holders of such shares to be redeemed based upon the total Redemption Price
applicable to each such holder’s shares of Preferred Stock which are subject to redemption on
such Redemption Date. The shares of Preferred Stock not redeemed shall remain outstanding
and entitled to all the rights and preferences provided herein. At any time thereafter when
additional funds of the Corporation are legally available for the redemption of shares of Preferred
Stock, such funds will immediately be used to redeem the balance of the shares which the
Corporation has become obliged to redeem on any Redemption Date but which it has not
redeemed.

4. Conversion. The holders of Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights
as follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Subject to Sections 4(c) and 8, each share of
Series B-3 and Series C Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof,
at any time after the date of issuance of such share, at the office of the Corporation or any transfer
agent for such stock, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock

OHS West:260685385.4
15931-1 -7-
as is determined by dividing (i) $0.471 in the case of the Series B-3 Preferred Stock (as adjusted
for stock splits, stock dividends, reclassification or the like) or Gi) $0.471 in the case of the
Series C Preferred Stock (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reclassification or the
like), by the Conversion Price applicable to such share, determined as hereafter provided, in
effect on the date the certificate is surrendered for conversion (the conversion rate for the

Series B-3 and Series C Preferred Stock into Common Stock is referred to herein as the
“Conversion Rate” for such series). The initial Conversion Price per share shall be $0.471 for
shares of Series B-3 Preferred Stock and $0.471 for shares of Series C Preferred Stock. Such
initial Conversion Prices shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 4(d) below.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Series B-3 and Series C
Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the Conversion
Rate at the time in effect for such share immediately upon the earlier of (i) except as provided
below in Section 4(c), the Corporation’s sale of its Common Stock in a firm commitment
underwritten public offering pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) which results in aggregate cash proceeds to the
Corporation of at least $50,000,000 (net of underwriting discounts and commissions) or (1i) the
date specified by written consent or agreement of the holders of a majority of the then
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a class and on an as converted basis;
provided, however, that if such automatic conversion is in connection with a Liquidation
Transaction in which the aggregate proceeds being distributed to the stockholders of the
Corporation is less than $40,000,000, the shares of Preferred Stock shall not be so converted
without the vote or written consent of the holders of at least 66-2/3% of the outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class on an as converted basis.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Series B-3 or
Series C Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert such Preferred Stock into shares of Common
Stock, the holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the
office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for such series of Preferred Stock, and shall
give written notice to the Corporation at its principal corporate office, of the election to convert
the same and shall state therein the name or names in which the certificate or certificates for
shares of Common Stock are to be issued. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable
thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or
nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock
to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid. Such conversion shall be deemed to have
been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares
of such series of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive
the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as
the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock as of such date. If the conversion
is in connection with an underwritten public offering of securities registered pursuant to the
Securities Act the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering such Preferred Stock for
conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of securities
pursuant to such offering, in which event any persons entitled to receive Common Stock upon
conversion of such Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock
until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities.

OHS West:260685385.4
(5931-1 -8-
(d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock for Certain
Dilutive Issuances, Splits and Combinations. The Conversion Price of the Series B-3 and
Series C Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

(i) Issuance of Additional Stock below Purchase Price. If
the Corporation should issue, at any time after the filing date of the Restated Certificate (the
“Filing Date”), any Additional Stock (as defined below) without consideration or for a
consideration per share less than the Conversion Price for such series in effect immediately prior
to the issuance of such Additional Stock, the Conversion Price for such series in effect
immediately prior to each such issuance shall automatically be adjusted as set forth in this
Section 4(d)(i), unless otherwise provided in this Section 4(d)(4).

(A) Adjustment Formula. Whenever the Conversion
Price is adjusted pursuant to this Section (4)(d)(i), the new Conversion Price shall be determined
by multiplying the Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction, (x) the numerator of which shall
be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance (the
“Outstanding Common”) plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate
consideration received by the Corporation for such issuance would purchase at such Conversion
Price; and (y) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Outstanding Common
plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock. For purposes of the foregoing calculation,
the term “Outstanding Common” shall include shares of Common Stock deemed issued pursuant
to Section 4(d)(i)(E) below.

(B) Definition of “Additional Stock.” For purposes of
this Section 4(d)(), “Additional Stock” shall mean any shares of Common Stock issued (or
deemed to have been issued pursuant to Section 4(d)(i)(E)) by the Corporation after the Filing
Date) other than:

(1) | Common Stock issued pursuant to stock
dividends, stock splits or similar transactions, as described in Section 4(d)(ii) hereof;

(2) Shares of Common Stock issued or issuable
to employees, consultants or directors of the Corporation directly or pursuant to a stock option
plan, restricted stock plan, or other similar plan or arrangement unanimously approved by the
Board of Directors;

(3) Capital stock, or options or warrants to
purchase capital stock, issued to financial institutions or lessors in connection with commercial
credit arrangements, equipment financings, commercial property lease transactions or similar
transactions the principal purpose of which is other than raising capital through the sale of equity
securities of the Corporation and which is unanimously approved by the Board of Directors;

(4) Shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock
issuable upon exercise of warrants, notes or other rights to acquire securities of the Corporation
outstanding as of the date of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation;

OHS West:260685385.4
15931-1 -9-
(5) Capital stock, or warrants or options to
purchase capital stock, issued in connection with bona fide acquisitions, mergers or similar
transactions, the terms of which are approved by the Board of Directors;

(6) Shares of Common Stock issuable or issued
upon conversion of the Series B-3 or Series C Preferred Stock;

(7) Shares of Common Stock issued or issuable
in a public offering prior to or in connection with which all outstanding shares of Series B-3 and
Series C Preferred Stock will be converted to Common Stock;

(8) Shares of Common Stock issued primarily
for purposes other than raising capital that, with the unanimous approval of the Corporation’s
Board of Directors, are expressly not deemed “Additional Stock;”

(9) Shares of Common Stock issued or deemed
issued pursuant to Section 4(d)(i)(E) as a result of a decrease in the Conversion Price of any
series of Preferred Stock resulting from the operation of this Section 4(d);

(10) Shares of Series B-3 Preferred Stock issued
in the Preferred Stock Recapitalization; and

(11) Shares of Series C Preferred Stock issued
pursuant to that certain Series C Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement dated on or about the
effective date of the Restated Certificate.

(C) No Fractional Adjustments. No adjustment of the
Conversion Price for the Series B-3 or Series C Preferred Stock shall be made in an amount less
than one hundred thousandths of one cent per share, provided that any adjustments which are not
required to be made by reason of this sentence shall be carried forward and shall be either taken
into account in any subsequent adjustment made prior to three years from the date of the event
giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward, or shail be made at the end of three years
from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward.

(D) Determination of Consideration. In the case of
the issuance of Common Stock for cash, the consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of
cash paid therefor before deducting any reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses
allowed, paid or incurred by the Corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection
with the issuance and sale thereof. In the case of the issuance of the Common Stock for a
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be
deemed to be the fair value thereof as determined by the Board of Directors irrespective of any
accounting treatment.

(E) Deemed Issuances of Common Stock. In the case
of the issuance (whether before, on or after the Filing Date) of securities or rights convertible
into, or entitling the holder thereof to receive directly or indirectly, additional shares of Common

OHS West:260685385.4
15931-1 -10-
Stock (the “Common Stock Equivalents”), the following provisions shall apply for all purposes
of this Section 4(d)(1):

(1) The aggregate maximum number of shares
of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion, exchange or exercise (assuming the satisfaction
of any conditions to convertibility, exchangeability or exercisability, including, without
limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account potential antidilution
adjustments) of any Common Stock Equivalents and subsequent conversion, exchange or
exercise thereof shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or
such Common Stock Equivalents were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration,
if any, received by the Corporation for any such securities and related Common Stock
Equivalents (excluding any cash received on account of accrued interest or accrued dividends),
plus the minimum additional consideration, if any, to be received by the Corporation (without
taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) upon the conversion, exchange or exercise
of any Common Stock Equivalents (the consideration in each case to be determined in the
manner provided in Section 4(d)(i)(D)).

(2) In the event of any change in the number of
shares of Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon
conversion, exchange or exercise of any Common Stock Equivalents, other than a change
resulting from the antidilution provisions thereof, the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred
Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such Common Stock Equivalents,
shall be recomputed to reflect such change, but no further adjustment shall be made for the actual
issuance of Common Stock or any payment of such consideration upon the conversion, exchange
or exercise of such Common Stock Equivalents.

(3) Upon the termination or expiration of the
convertibility, exchangeability or exercisability of any Common Stock Equivalents, the
Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or
computed using such Common Stock Equivalents, shall be recomputed to reflect the issuance of
only the number of shares of Common Stock (and Common Stock Equivalents that remain
convertible, exchangeable or exercisable) actually issued upon the conversion, exchange or
exercise of such Common Stock Equivalents.

(4) The number of shares of Common Stock
deemed issued and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to Section 4(d)(i)(E)(1) shail
be appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or expiration of the type described in
either Section 4(d)(i)(E)(2) or 4(d)(i)(E)(3).

(F) No Increased Conversion Price. Notwithstanding
any other provisions of this Section (4)(d)(i), except to the limited extent provided for in Sections
4(d)G)(E)(2) and 4(d)(i)(E)(3), no adjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section
4(d)(i) shal] have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price above the Conversion Price in
effect immediately prior to such adjustment.

Gi) Stock Splits and Dividends. In the event the Corporation
should at any time after the Filing Date fix a record date for the effectuation of a split or
subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or the determination of holders of
Common Stock entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of
Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents without payment of any consideration by such
holder for the additional shares of Common Stock or the Common Stock Equivalents (including
the additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof), then, as of
such record date (or the date of such dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no record date
is fixed), the Conversion Price of each of the Series B-3 and Series C Preferred Stock shall be
appropriately decreased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of
each share of such series shall be increased in proportion to such increase of the aggregate of
shares of Common Stock outstanding and those issuable with respect to such Common Stock
Equivalents with the number of shares issuable with respect to Common Stock Equivalents
determined from time to time in the manner provided for deemed issuances in Section 4(d)(i)(E).

(iii) Reverse Stock Splits. Ifthe number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding at any time after the Filing Date is decreased by a combination of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock, then, following the record date of such combination, the
Conversion Price for each of the Series B-3 and Series C Preferred Stock shall be appropriately
increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of
such series shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares.

(e) Other Distributions. In the event the Corporation shall declare a
distribution payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by the
Corporation or other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred
to in Section 4(d)(i) or 4(d)(i), then, in each such case for the purpose of this Section 4(e), the
holders of Series B-3 and Series C Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a proportionate share of
any such distribution as though they were the holders of the number of shares of Common Stock
of the Corporation into which their shares of Preferred Stock are convertible as of the record date
fixed for the determination of the holders of Common Stock of the Corporation entitled to
receive such distribution.

(f) Recapitalizations. If at any time or from time to time there shall
be a recapitalization of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision, combination or merger or
sale of assets transaction provided for elsewhere in this Section 4 or in Section 2) provision shall
be made so that the holders of the Series B-3 and Series C Preferred Stock shall thereafter be
entitled to receive upon conversion of such Preferred Stock the number of shares of stock or
other securities or property of the Corporation or otherwise, to which a holder of Common Stock
deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled on such recapitalization. In any such case,
appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 4 with
respect to the rights of the holders of such Preferred Stock after the recapitalization to the end
that the provisions of this Section 4 (including adjustment of the Conversion Price then in effect
and the number of shares purchasable upon conversion of such Preferred Stock) shall be
applicable after that event and be as nearly equivalent as practicable.

OHS West:260685385.4

(g) No Fractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments.

(i) No fractional shares shali be issued upon the conversion of
any share or shares of the Series B-3 or Series C Preferred Stock, and the number of shares of
Common Stock to be issued shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share. The number of
shares issuable upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of
shares of Series B-3 or Series C Preferred Stock the holder is at the time converting into
Common Stock and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such aggregate
conversion. If the conversion would result in any fractional share, the Corporation shall, in lieu
of issuing any such fractional share, pay the holder thereof an amount in cash equal to the fair
market value of such fractional share on the date of conversion, as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors.

(ii) | Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of
the Conversion Price of Series B-3 or Series C Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4, the
Corporation, at its expense, shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in
accordance with the terms hereof and prepare and furnish to each holder of such Preferred Stock
a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon
which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon the written request
at any time of any holder of Series B-3 or Series C Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be
furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (A) such adjustment and readjustment,

(B) the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock at the time in effect, and (C) the
number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time
would be received upon the conversion of a share of such series of Preferred Stock.

(h) Notices of Record Date. In the event of any taking by the
Corporation of a record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining
the holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend) or other
distribution, any right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of stock of any
class or any other securities or property, or to receive any other right, the Corporation shall mail
to each holder of Series B-3 or Series C Preferred Stock, at least 10 days prior to the date
specified therein, a notice specifying the date on which any such record is to be taken for the
purpose of such dividend, distribution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend,
distribution or right.

(a) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The

Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares
of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the

Series B-3 and Series C Preferred Stock, such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall
from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of such series of
Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common
Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of such series
of Preferred Stock, in addition to such other remedies as shall be available to the holder of such
Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its
counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such
number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging

OHS West:260685385.4
15931-1 -13-

then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a class and on an as converted
basis:

OHS West:260685385.4
15931-1 -15-
Common Stock from employees, officers, directors, consultants or other persons performing

Preferred Stock shall be redeemed or converted pursuant to Section 3 or Section 4 hereof, the
shares so redeemed or converted shall be cancelled and shall not be issuable by the Corporation.
The Restated Certificate shall be appropriately amended to effect the corresponding reduction in
this corporation’s authorized capital stock.

8. Special Mandatory Conversion.

(a) In the event after the date that the first share of Series C Preferred
Stock is issued:

(1) _ the Corporation’s Board of Directors approves a financing
that will result in the sale of any shares of, or securities convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for any shares of, its capital stock;

(2) the Board of Directors of the Corporation (with interested
directors able to vote for purposes of this provision) determines that it is in the best interests of
the Corporation for the holders of Preferred Stock of the Corporation to participate in such
financing (in which case such financing will be deemed a “Mandatory Offering”) and determines
the aggregate dollar amount to be invested by all holders of Preferred Stock (the “Aggregate
Investment Amount”), which, for avoidance of doubt, amount may represent more or less than
the total proceeds actually raised by the Corporation from the holders of Preferred Stock in the
financing;

OHS West:260685385.4
15931-1 -16-
(3) the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock, voting together as a class and on an as converted basis, also determine that the
financing shall be a Mandatory Offering;

(4) the Corporation delivers a notice (“Notice”) to the holders
of Preferred Stock (4) stating the Corporation’s bona fide intention to consummate such
financing, (ii) indicating the number of securities to be offered, (iii) indicating the price and
terms upon which it proposes to offer such securities, (iv) identifying the Pro Rata Share (as
defined below) of each holder of Preferred Stock of the Aggregate Investment Amount, and
(v) offering each holder of Preferred Stock the right to purchase such holder’s Pro Rata Share of
the Aggregate Investment Amount within the time periods set forth in the Notice; and

(5) a holder and/or an affiliate of such holder (a
Non-Participating Holder”) does not acquire at least such holder’s Pro Rata Share of the
Aggregate Investment Amount (whether or not such Aggregate Investment Amount is more than
or less than the aggregate dollar amount actually received by the Corporation from the holders in
connection with the Mandatory Offering, as may be the case, for example, if certain holders do
not participate in the Mandatory Offering) within the time periods set forth in the Notice;

ce

then all of each Non-Participating Holder’s shares of Preferred Stock shall automatically and
without further action on the part of such holder be converted, effective upon, subject to and
concurrently with the consummation of the Mandatory Offering (the “Mandatory Offering
Date’’), into shares of Common Stock of the Corporation at a Conversion Rate equal to the
Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the consummation of the Mandatory Offering.
For purposes of this Section, each holder’s “Pro Rata Share” of the Aggregate Investment
Amount shall be an amount determined by multiplying the Aggregate Investment Amount by a
fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of the Preferred Stock held by such holder immediately prior to the consummation of
the Mandatory Offering and the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the consummation of the Mandatory Offering. A holder’s Pro Rata Share may equal more or less
than any such holder’s right to participate in a financing of the Corporation pursuant to any
contractual right of first offer or similar right.

(b) — The holder of any shares of Preferred Stock converted pursuant to
this Section 8 shall deliver to the Corporation during regular business hours at the office of any
transfer agent of the Corporation for the Preferred Stock, or at such other place as may be
designated by the Corporation, the certificate or certificates for the shares so converted, duly
endorsed or assigned in blank or to the Corporation. As promptly as practicable thereafter, the
Corporation shall issue and deliver to such holder, at the place designated by such holder, a
certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of the Common Stock to be issued and
such holder shall be deemed to have become a stockholder of record of Common Stock on the
Mandatory Offering Date, unless the transfer books of the Corporation are closed on that date, in
which event such holder shail be deemed to have become a stockholder of record of Common
Stock on the next succeeding date on which the transfer books are open. From and after the
Mandatory Offering Date, the certificate or certificates representing shares of Preferred Stock

OHS West:260685385.4
15931-1 -17-
converted pursuant to this Section 8 shall represent the shares of Common Stock into which such
shares of Preferred Stock were converted.

(C) Common Stock.

l. Dividend Rights. Subject to the prior rights of holders of all classes of
stock at the time outstanding having prior rights as to dividends, the holders of the Common
Stock shall be entitled to receive, when and as declared by the Board of Directors, out of any
assets of the Corporation legally available therefor, such dividends as may be declared from time
to time by the Board of Directors.

2. Liquidation Rights. Upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of
the Corporation or the occurrence of a Liquidation Transaction, the assets of the Corporation
shall be distributed as provided in Section 2 of Article IV(B).

3. Redemption. The Common Stock is not redeemable at the option of the
holder thereof.

4. Voting Rights. Each holder of Common Stock shall have the right to one
vote per share of Common Stock, and shall be entitled to notice of any stockholders’ meeting in
accordance with the bylaws of the Corporation, and shall be entitled to vote upon such matters
and in such manner as may be provided by law. The number of authorized shares of Common
Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then
outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of shares of stock of the Corporation
representing a majority of the votes represented by all outstanding shares of stock of the
Corporation entitled to vote, irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b){2) of the Delaware
General Corporation Law.

ARTICLE V

Corporation is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal Bylaws of the Corporation.

same exists or as may hereafter be amended, a director of the Corporation shall not be personally
liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as
a director. If the Delaware General Corporation Law is amended after approval by the
stockholders of this Article VII to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the
personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of this Corporation shall be

OHS West:260685385.4
15931-1 -18-
eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law as
so amended.

{B) — The Corporation shall indemnify to the fullest extent permitted by law any person
made or threatened to be made a party to an action or proceeding, whether criminal, civil,

any other enterprise as a director or officer at the request of the Corporation or any predecessor to
the Corporation.

(C) Neither any amendment nor repeal of this Article VII, nor the adoption of any
provision of the Restated Certificate inconsistent with this Article VII, shall eliminate or reduce
the effect of this Article VII in respect of any matter occurring, or any action or proceeding
accruing or arising or that, but for this Article VII, would accrue or arise, prior to such
