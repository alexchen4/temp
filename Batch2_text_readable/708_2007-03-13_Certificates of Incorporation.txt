ASCENTA Series C Certificate of Incorporation_v8 (2).DOC
total number of shares which the Corporation is authorized to issue is Two Hundred
Fifty-Three Million Four Hundred Forty-Four Thousand Three Hundred Thirty-Six
(253,444,336) shares each having a par value of one tenth of one cent ($0.001) per share.
One Hundred Fifty-Five Million (155,000,000) shares shall be Common Stock. Ninety-
Eight Million Four Hundred Forty-Four Thousand Three Hundred Thirty-Six
(98,444,336) shares shall be Preferred Stock, of which Seven Million Eight Hundred
Fifty-Seven Thousand One Hundred Forty-Five (7,857,145) shares of the Preferred Stock
are designated “Series A Preferred Stock,” Thirty-Five Million Five Hundred Eighty-
Seven Thousand One Hundred Eighty-Nine (35,587,189) shares of the Preferred Stock
are designated “Series B Preferred Stock,” and Fifty-Five Million and Two
(55,000,002) of the Preferred Stock are designated “Series C Preferred Stock.” The
Series A Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock and the Series C Preferred Stock
are sometimes referred to collectively as the “Preferred Stock.” The number of
authorized shares of Common Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the
number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon (voting
together as a single class on an as-if-converted basis).

B. Preferred Stock. The powers, preferences, rights, restrictions, and other
matters relating to each series of Preferred Stock are as follows:

l. Dividends

a. The holders of the Preferred Stock, in preference to the
holders of Common Stock, shall be entitled to receive in any fiscal year of the
Corporation, out of any assets legally available therefor, dividends at the rate of eight -
percent (8%) of the applicable Original Issue Price (as defined herein) per share of
Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations or splits with respect
to such shares) per annum. The original issue price of the Series A Preferred Stock shall
be $0.70 per share (subject to adjustment for any stock dividends, combinations or splits
with respect to such shares) (the “Series A Original Issue Price”). The original issue
price of the Series B Preferred Stock shall be $0.843 per share (subject to adjustment for
any stock dividends, combinations or splits with respect to such shares) (the “Series B
Original Issue Price”). The original issue price of the Series C Preferred Stock shall be
$1.00 per share (subject to adjustment for any stock dividends, combinations or splits
with respect to such shares) (the “Series C Original Issue Price” and generally, together
with the Series A Original Issue Price and the Series B Original Issue Price, the
“Original Issue Price”). Such dividends shall be payable only when, as, and if declared
by the Board of Directors. Dividends payable with respect to the Preferred Stock shall be
non-cumulative.

No dividends shall be paid on any shares of Common Stock of the Corporation
during any fiscal year of the Corporation until dividends at an equal rate on each share of
Preferred Stock shall have been paid or declared and irrevocably set apart during that
fiscal year and any prior year in which dividends accumulated but remain unpaid.
b. In the event the Corporation shall declare a distribution
payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by the
Corporation or other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights to
purchase any such securities or evidences of indebtedness, then, in each such case the
holders of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any such
distribution as though the holders of the Preferred Stock were the holders of the number
of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation into which their shares of Preferred Stock
are convertible as of the record date fixed for the determination of the holders of
Common Stock of the Corporation entitled to receive such distribution.

2. Liquidation Preference

a. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of
the Corporation (each a “Liquidation”), whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of
shares of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, on a pari passu basis and prior and
in preference to any distribution of any of the assets or surplus funds of the Corporation
to the holders of the Common Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount
equal to the applicable Original Issue Price for each share of Preferred Stock (as adjusted
for any stock dividends, combinations or splits with respect to such shares) then held by
such holder, plus all declared but unpaid dividends on each such share. If upon the
occurrence of a Liquidation, the assets and funds to be distributed among the holders of
the Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full
aforesaid preferential amount, then the entire assets and funds of the Corporation legally
available for distribution shall be distributed ratably among the holders of the Preferred
Stock in proportion to the preferential amount each such holder is otherwise entitled to
receive hereunder.

b. After payment to the holders of the Preferred Stock of the
amounts set forth in Article 4(B)(2)(a) above, the entire remaining assets and funds of the
Corporation legally available for distribution, if any, shall be distributed ratably among
the holders of the Preferred Stock and Common Stock, based on the number of shares of
Common Stock that would then be held by each holder, assuming conversion of all
shares of the Preferred Stock at the then applicable Conversion Price; provided, however,
that if the aggregate amount which the holders of Preferred Stock are entitled to receive
under this Article 4(B)(2)(a) and (b) would exceed three (3) times the applicable Original
Issue Price for such series of Preferred Stock (subject to appropriate adjustment in the
event of a stock split, stock dividend, combination, reclassification, or similar event
affecting the applicable series of Preferred Stock ) (the “Maximum Participation
Amount”), each holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive upon such
Liquidation the greater of (i) the Maximum Participation Amount and (ii) the amount
such holder would have received if such holder had converted his, her or its shares of
Preferred Stock into Common Stock immediately prior to such Liquidation at the then
applicable Conversion Price.

c. Subject to the requirements of Article 4(B)(6), each holder
of an outstanding share of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have consented, solely for
purposes of Section 160 of the DGCL (and, if applicable, Sections 502, 503 and 506 of
the California Corporations Code), to distributions made by the Corporation in
connection with the repurchase of shares of Common Stock issued to or held by
employees or consultants upon termination of their employment or services pursuant to
agreements providing for the right of said repurchase between the Corporation and such
persons.

d. A sale, conveyance or other disposition (in one or a series
of related transactions) of ali or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, or a
consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into any other entity or entities, shall
be deemed to be a Liquidation within the meaning of this Article 4(B)(2) and shall entitle
the holders of the Preferred Stock to receive at the closing of such transaction (and at
each date after the closing on which additional amounts (such as earnout payments,
escrow amounts and other contingent payments) are paid to stockholders of the
Corporation) the amount to which they are entitled pursuant to this Article 4(B)(2);
provided, however, that a sale, conveyance, disposition, consolidation or merger
involving the Corporation shall not be deemed to be a Liquidation within the meaning of
this Article 4(B)(2)(d) if (i) following completion of the transaction, the holders of shares
of the Corporation immediately prior to the transaction continue to own shares which
represent a majority of the voting power of the surviving corporation (or if the surviving
corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary, of the parent of the surviving corporation) in
substantially the same proportions or (ii) holders of at least sixty percent (60%) of the
voting power of all then outstanding shares of Series B and C Preferred Stock, voting
together as a single class and on an as converted to Common Stock basis, determine that
such sale, conveyance, disposition, consolidation or merger shall not constitute a
Liquidation within the meaning of this Article 4(B)(2).

e. Whenever the distribution provided for in this Article
4(B)(2) shall be payable in securities or property other than cash, the value of such
distribution shall be the fair market value of such securities or property. Any securities
shall be valued as follows:

(i) Freely traded securities:

(A) If traded on a securities exchange or through
the NASDAQ National Market, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the
closing prices of the securities on such exchange or system over the thirty (30) day period
ending three (3) days prior to the date of determination;

(B) ‘If actively traded over-the-counter but not
on the NASDAQ National Market, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the
closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the thirty (30) day period ending
three (3) days prior to the date of determination; and

(C) If there is no active public market, the value .
shall be the fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by (a) the Board of
Directors of the Corporation, (b) the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of
all then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class and on an
as converted to Common Stock basis, and (c) the holders of at least sixty percent (60%)
of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of Series B and Series C Preferred
Stock, voting together as a single class and on an as converted to Common Stock basis.

(ii) | The method of valuation of securities subject to
investment letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising
solely by virtue of a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to
make an appropriate discount from the market value determined as above in (i)(A), (B) or
(C) above to reflect the approximate fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by
(a) the Board of Directors of the Corporation, (b) the holders of at least a majority of the
voting power of all then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single
class and on an as converted to Common Stock basis, and (c) the holders of at least sixty
percent (60%) of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of Series B and C
Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class and on an as converted to Common
Stock basis.

(iii) | The fair market value of any property other than
securities or cash shall be mutually determined by (a) the Board of Directors of the
Corporation, (b) the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class and on an as
converted to Common Stock basis, and (c) the holders of at least sixty percent (60%) of
the voting power of all then outstanding shares of Series B and Series C Preferred Stock,
voting together as a single class and on an as converted to Common Stock basis.

(iv) | The Corporation shall give each holder of record of .
Preferred Stock written notice of such impending Liquidation within ten (10) days after
the Board of Directors approves such Liquidation or within ten (10) days after the
commencement of any involuntary proceeding, whichever is earlier. Such written notice
shall describe the material terms and conditions of the impending Liquidation and the
provisions of this Section 2, and the Corporation shall thereafter give such holders
prompt notice of any material changes. The Liquidation shall in no event take place
sooner than twenty (20) days after the Corporation has given the first notice provided for
herein or sooner than ten (10) days after the Corporation has given notice of any material
changes provided for herein; provided, however, that such periods may be shortened
upon the written consent of the holders of the Preferred Stock that are entitled to such
notice rights or similar notice rights and that represent (a) at least a majority of the voting
power of all then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class
and on an as converted to Common Stock basis and (v) at least sixty percent (60%) of the
voting power of all then outstanding shares of Series B and Series C Preferred Stock,
voting together as a single class and on an as converted to Common Stock basis.
3. Redemption of Preferred Stock

a. The Corporation shall not have the right to call or redeem
any shares of any series of Preferred Stock at its option. The Corporation shall not
redeem any series of Preferred Stock prior to redemption of the Series B or Series C
Preferred Stock.

db. At any time after the fourth (4th) anniversary of the date on
which the first share of Series C Preferred Stock is issued by the Corporation, and at the
election of (a) the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class on an as converted
to Common Stock basis, and (b) the holders of at least sixty percent (60%) of the voting
power of all then outstanding shares of Series B and Series C Preferred Stock, voting
together as a single class on an as converted to Common Stock basis, the Corporation
shall redeem in three (3) annual installments (each payment date being referred to herein
as a “Redemption Date”), each of which Redemption Dates shall be on the dates
specified in a written notice from the required holders of Preferred Stock (which first
Redemption Date shall be no earlier than sixty (60) days after the date of the notice), the
shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding as of the Redemption Date, by paying in cash
therefor, the applicable Original Issue Price for each share of Preferred Stock (as adjusted
for any stock dividends, combinations or splits with respect to such shares), plus all
declared but unpaid dividends on such shares (the “Redemption Price”). The number
of shares of each series of Preferred Stock that the Corporation shall be required to
redeem on any one Redemption Date shall be equal to the amount determined by dividing
(i) the aggregate number of shares of such series of Preferred Stock outstanding
immediately prior to such Redemption Date by (ii) the number of remaining Redemption
Dates (including the Redemption Date to which such calculation applies). Any
redemption of a series of Preferred Stock effected pursuant to this Article 4(B)(3)(a) shall
be made on a pro rata basis among the holders of each series of Preferred Stock in
proportion to the aggregate Redemption Price that each such holder of Preferred Stock
would otherwise be entitled to receive on the applicable Redemption Date.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article 4(B)(3), the Corporation will not be
required to redeem shares on any Redemption Date to the extent funds are not legally
available. If funds are not legally available to consummate a redemption under this
Article 4(B)(3), the Corporation shall redeem the maximum number of shares for which
funds are legally available and will redeem the remaining shares of Preferred Stock as
soon as sufficient funds are legally available until the total number of shares that it has _
redeemed is equal to the total number of shares that it would have redeemed at such time
as if it had redeemed in accordance with the provisions of this Article 4(B)(3).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any holder of Series C Preferred may waive the
redemption right set forth in this Article 4(B)(3)(b), with respect to the Series C Preferred
Stock held by such holder, by delivering written notice of such waiver to the Corporation
and the other holders of Preferred Stock at least ten (10) days prior to the first
Redemption Date.
c. The Corporation shall give notice by certified mail, postage
prepaid, return receipt requested, to the holders of record of such shares of Preferred
Stock to be redeemed, such notice to be addressed to each holder at the address shown in
the Corporation’s records, which notice shall specify the applicable Redemption Date, the
number of shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed, the holder to be redeemed and the
date on which conversion rights terminate (which shall not be prior to the fifth (5) day
preceding the applicable Redemption Date). Such notice shall be given no more than
sixty (60) but no less than thirty (30) days prior to the applicable Redemption Date. On
or after the applicable Redemption Date, each holder shall surrender such holder’s
certificate (or comply with applicable lost certificate provisions) for the number of shares
to be redeemed as stated in the notice to the Corporation at the place specified in such
notice. If less than all of the shares represented by such certificate are redeemed, a new
certificate shall forthwith be issued for the unredeemed shares. Provided such notice is
duly given, and provided that on the Redemption Date specified there shall be a source of
funds legally available for such redemption, then all rights with respect to such shares
shall, after the specified Redemption Date, terminate, whether or not said certificates
have been surrendered, excepting only in the latter instance the right of the holder to
receive the Redemption Price thereof, without interest, upon such surrender (or
compliance with lost certificate provisions).

4, Voting Rights. Each holder of shares of the Preferred Stock shall
be entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of shares of Common Stock into
which such shares of Preferred Stock could be converted at the time of any vote or
consent and shal! have voting rights and powers equal to the voting rights and powers of
the Common Stock (except as otherwise expressly provided herein or as required by law,
voting together with the Common Stock as a single class) and shall be entitled to notice
of any stockholders’ meeting in accordance with the Bylaws of the Corporation.
Fractional votes shall not, however, be permitted and any fractional voting rights
resulting from the above formula (after aggregating all shares into which shares of
Preferred Stock held by each holder could be converted) shall be rounded to the nearest
whole number (with one-half being rounded upward).

5. Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have
conversion rights as follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

a. Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be
convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of
such share, at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for such stock, into such
number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as provided herein.

b. Conversion of Preferred Stock. The number of shares of
Common Stock to which a holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled upon
conversion of a share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be determined by dividing the
Series A Original Issue Price by the Series A Conversion Price (as defined herein) in
effect at the time that the conversion right is exercised. The number of shares of
Common Stock to which a holder of Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled upon
conversion of a share of Series B Preferred Stock shall be determined by dividing the
Series B Original Issue Price by the Series B Conversion Price (as defined herein) in
effect at the time that the conversion right is exercised. The number of shares of
Common Stock to which a holder of Series C Preferred Stock shall be entitled upon
conversion of a share of Series C Preferred Stock shall be determined by dividing the
Series C Original Issue Price by the Series C Conversion Price (as defined herein) in
effect at the time that the conversion right is exercised.

c. Conversion Price. The conversion price for the Series A
Preferred Stock shall initially be $0.70, subject to adjustment as hereinafter provided (the
“Series A Conversion Price”). The conversion price for the Series B Preferred Stock
shall initially be $0.843, subject to adjustment as hereinafter provided (the “Series B
Conversion Price”). The conversion price for the Series C Preferred Stock shall initially
be $1.00, subject to adjustment as hereinafter provided (the “Series C Conversion
Price”).

d. Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall
automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the Series A Conversion
Price, the Series B Conversion Price or the Series C Conversion Price, as applicable,
upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the date or event specified by written consent or
agreement of (A) the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class and on an as
converted to Common Stock basis, and (B) the holders of at least sixty percent (60%) of
voting power of all then outstanding shares of Series B and Series C Preferred Stock,
voting together as a single class and on an as converted to Common Stock basis, or (ii)
immediately upon the closing of the sale of the Corporation’s Common Stock in a firm
commitment, underwritten public offering registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the “Securities Act”), with aggregate offering proceeds to the Corporation
(after deduction for underwriters’ discounts and expenses relating to the issuance) of at
least $35,000,000 and a public offering price per share that is not less than $3.00 (subject
to adjustment for any stock dividends, stock splits, recapitalizations or the like). Upon
the occurrence of either of the events specified in the prior sentence, the outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically without any further action by
the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates representing such shares are
surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent; provided, however, that the
Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common
Stock issuable upon such conversion unless the certificates evidencing such shares of
Preferred Stock are either delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent, or the holder
thereof notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost,
stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to
indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such
certificates. Upon the occurrence of any automatic conversion of the Preferred Stock, the
holders of Preferred Stock shall promptly surrender the certificates representing such
shares at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock.
Thereupon, there shall be issued and delivered to such holder promptly at such office and
in its name as shown on such surrendered certificate or certificates, a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Preferred
Stock surrendered were convertible on the date on which such automatic conversion
occurred.

e. Mechanics of Conversion

(i) Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock other than an automatic
conversion under clause (d) above, such holder shall surrender the certificate or
certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer
agent for such stock, and shall give written notice to the Corporation at such office that
such holder elects to convert the same and shall state therein the name or names in which
such hojder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be
issued. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such
office to such holder of Preferred Stock, a certificate or.certificates for the number of
shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid. Such
conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business
on the date of surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person
or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion
shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common
Stock on such date.

(ii) —‘_If the conversion is in connection with an
underwritten offering of securities pursuant to the Securities Act, the conversion may, at
the option of any holder tendering shares of Preferred Stock for conversion, be
conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to
such offering, in which event the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock upon
conversion of the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred
Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities.

f. Adjustments to Conversion Price for Stock Dividends and

for Combinations or Subdivisions of Common Stock. In the event that the Corporation at
any time shall declare or pay, without consideration, any dividend on the Common Stock
payable in Common Stock or in any right to acquire Common Stock for no consideration,
or shall effect a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater
number of shares of Common Stock (by stock split, reclassification or otherwise than by
payment of a dividend in Common Stock or in any right to acquire Common Stock), or in
the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined or consolidated, by
reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, without,
in each case, a corresponding and proportionate adjustment to the Preferred Stock, each
of the Series A Conversion Price, the Series B Conversion Price and the Series C
Conversion Price prior to such event shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such
event, be proportionately decreased or increased, as appropriate. In the event that the
Corporation shall declare or pay, without consideration, any dividend on the Common
Stock payable in any right to acquire Common Stock for no consideration then the
Corporation shall be deemed to have made a dividend payable in Common Stock in an
amount of shares equal to the maximum number of shares issuable upon exercise of such
rights to acquire Common Stock.

g. Adjustments for Reclassification and Reorganization. If
the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be changed into
the same or a different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock, whether by
capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or
combination of shares provided for in Article 4(B)(5)(£) above or a merger or other
reorganization that constitutes a Liquidation under Article 4(B)(2)(d) above), then each
share of Preferred Stock shall thereafter be convertible into the number of shares of stock
or other securities or property to which a holder of the number of shares of Common
Stock of the Corporation deliverable upon conversion of such shares of Preferred Stock
would be entitled upon such reorganization, reclassification or other event and, in such
case, appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith by the Board) shall be made in
the application of the provisions in this Section 5 set forth with respect to the rights and
interests thereafter of the holders of Preferred Stock, to the end that the provisions set
forth in this Section 5 (including provisions with respect to changes in and other
adjustments of the Conversion Price) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as
reasonably may be, in relation to any shares of stock or other securities thereafter
deliverable upon the conversion of shares of Preferred Stock.

h. Adjustments for Issuance of Additional Equity Securities:

(i) Special Definitions. For purposes of this Section
5(h), the following definitions shall apply:

(A) “Qption” shall mean rights, options or
warrants to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire Common Stock or Convertible
Securities.

which a share of Series C Preferred Stock was first issued.

(C) “Convertible Securities” shall mean any
evidences of indebtedness, shares or other securities directly or indirectly convertible into
or exchangeable for Common Stock.

(D) “Additional Shares of Common Stock” shall
mean all shares of Common Stock issued (or, pursuant to Section 5(h)(iii) below, deemed
to be issued) by the Corporation on or after the Original Issue Date, other than shares of
Common Stock issued or issuable:

8) upon the conversion of shares of
Preferred Stock or as a dividend or distribution on Preferred Stock;
(II) pursuant to the acquisition of another
corporation or entity by the Corporation by way of merger, purchase of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, stock for stock exchange or other

split-up or other distribution on shares of Common Stock for which adjustment is
otherwise made pursuant to this Section 5; or

stock, issued not primarily for equity financing purposes to financial institutions, strategic
partners or lessors in connection with commercial credit arrangements, equipment
financings, debt financings, strategic partnerships, research and development
partnerships, licensing or collaborative arrangements or similar transactions approved by
the Board of Directors.

(ii) | No Adjustment of Conversion Price. No adjustment
in the Series A Conversion Price, the Series B Conversion Price or the Series C
Conversion Price shall be made, unless the consideration per share (determined pursuant
to Section 5(h)(v)) for an Additional Share of Common Stock issued or deemed to be
issued by the Corporation is less than the Series A Conversion Price, the Series B
Conversion Price or the Series C Conversion Price, as applicable, in effect on the date of,
and immediately prior to, the issue of such Additional Shares of Common Stock.

(iii) Issue of Securities Deemed Issue of Additional
Shares of Common Stock. If the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the
Original Issue Date shall issue any Options or Convertible Securities or shall fix a record
date for the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive any such
Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of shares of Common
Stock (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto without regard to any provision
contained therein designed to protect against dilution) issuable upon the exercise of such
Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities and Options therefor, the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to be Additional Shares of
Common Stock issued as of the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shall
have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, provided that Additional
Shares of Common Stock shall not be deemed to have been issued unless the
consideration per share (determined pursuant to Section 5(h)(v) hereof) of such
Additional Shares of Common Stock would be less than the Series A Conversion Price,
the Series B Conversion Price or the Series C Conversion Price, as applicable, in effect
on the date of, and immediately prior to, the deemed issuance, or such record date, as the
case may be, provided further that in any such case in which Additional Shares of

their terms provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any increase or decrease in
the consideration payable to the Corporation, or increase or decrease in the number of

(including but not limited to, a change resulting from the anti-dilution provisions thereof
(other than as provided for by Article 4(b)(5)(f) or (g) above or this 4(B)(5)(h)), the
Series A Conversion Price, the Series B Conversion Price and the Series C Conversion
Price, computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date
with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon any
such increase or decrease becoming effective, be recomputed to reflect such increase or
decrease insofar as it affects such Options or the rights of conversion or exchange under
such Convertible Securities;

(C) Upon the expiration or termination, as
applicable, of any such Options or Convertible Securities, the Series A Conversion Price,
the Series B Conversion Price and the Series C Conversion Price, if and to the extent
adjusted upon the original issuance thereof, shall be recomputed to reflect the issuance of
only the number of shares of Common Stock (and convertible or exchangeable securities
which remain in effect) actually issued upon the exercise or conversion of such Options
or Convertible Securities, upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or upon the
exercise or conversion of the Options or Convertible Securities related to such securities;

(D) Noreadjustment pursuant to clause (B) or
(C) above shall have the effect of increasing the Series A Conversion Price, the Series B
Conversion Price or the Series C Conversion Price to an amount which exceeds the lower
of (a) the Series A Conversion Price, the Series B Conversion Price or the Series C
Conversion Price, as applicable, on the original adjustment date for such (as adjusted for
stock splits, stock dividends and the like) and (b) the Series A Conversion Price, the
Series B Conversion Price or the Series C Conversion Price, as applicable, that would
have resulted from any issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock between the
original adjustment date and such readjustment date; and

-12-
(E) If such record date shall have been fixed and
such Options or Convertible Securities are not issued on the date fixed therefore, the
adjustments previously made in the Series A Conversion Price, the Series B Conversion
Price and the Series C Conversion Price which became effective on such record date shall
be cancelled as of the close of business on such record date, and thereafter the Series A
Conversion Price, the Series B Conversion Price and the Series C Conversion Price shall
be adjusted pursuant to this subsection 5(h)(iii) as of the actual date of their issuance.

(iv) Adjustment of the Conversion Price Upon Issuance
of Additional Shares of Common Stock. Subject to the provisions of Section 5(h)(ii) and
5(h)(v), in the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Original Issue Date issue
Additional Shares of Common Stock (including Additional Shares of Common Stock
deemed to be issued pursuant to Section 5(h)(iii), but excluding shares issued as a
dividend or distribution or upon a stock split or combination as provided in Section 5(f)),
without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Series A Conversion
Price, the Series B Conversion Price or the Series C Conversion Price, as applicable, in
effect on the date of and immediately prior to such issue, then and in such event, each of
the Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series C Conversion Price
that is greater than the consideration per share of such Additional Shares of Common
Stock (each a “Greater Conversion Price”) shall be reduced concurrently with such
issue to a price (calculated to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying such applicable
Greater Conversion Price by a fraction, (x) the numerator of which shall be the number of
shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all shares of Preferred Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of shares of Common Stock
which the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for the total number of
Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued would purchase at the Greater Conversion
Price and (y) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon conversion of all shares of Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior
to such issue plus the number of such Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Series A Conversion Price, the
Series B Conversion Price and the Series C Conversion Price shall be so reduced at such
time if the amount of such reduction would be an amount less than $.01, but any such
amount shall be carried forward and reduction with respect thereto made at the time of
and together with any subsequent reduction which, together with such amount and any
other amount or amounts so carried forward, shall aggregate $.01 or more.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of
this Section 5(h), the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any
Additional Shares of Common Stock shall be computed as follows:
(A) | Cash and Property. Such consideration
shall:

(1) insofar as it consists of cash, be
computed at the aggregate of cash received by the Corporation, excluding amounts paid
or payable for accrued interest or accrued dividends;

(ID insofar as it consists of property
other than cash, be computed at the fair market value thereof at the time of such issue, as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation; and

(IIT) inthe event Additional Shares of
Common Stock are issued together with other shares or securities or other assets of the
Corporation for consideration which covers both, be the proportion of such consideration
so received, computed as provided in clauses (I) and (ID) above, as determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

(B) Options and Convertible Securities. The

consideration per share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common
Stock deemed to have been issued pursuant to Section 5(h)(iii), relating to Options and
Convertible Securities, shall be determined by dividing:

(x) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by
the Corporation as consideration for the issue of
such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the
minimum aggregate amount of additional
consideration (as set forth in the instruments
relating thereto, without regard to any provision
contained therein designed to protect against
dilution) payable to the Corporation upon the
exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the
case of Options for Convertible Securities, the
exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities
and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, by

(y) | the maximum number of shares of Common Stock
(as set forth in the instruments relating thereto,
without regard to any provision contained therein
designed to protect against dilution) issuable upon
the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities.

each adjustment or readjustment of the Series A Conversion Price, the Series B

Conversion Price or the Series C Conversion Price pursuant to this Article 4(B)(5), the
Corporation at its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in
accordance with the terms hereof and prepare and furnish to each holder of Preferred
Stock a certificate executed by the Corporation’s President or a Vice President setting
forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such
adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon the written request at
any time of any holder of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder
a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and readjustments, (ii) the Series A
Conversion Price, the Series B Conversion Price or the Series C Conversion Price, as
applicable, at the time in effect, and (iii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the
amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon the
conversion of the Preferred Stock. :

j. Notices of Record Date. In the event that the Corporation
shall propose at any time: (i) to declare any dividend or distribution upon its Common
Stock, whether in cash, property, stock or other securities, whether or not a regular cash
dividend and whether or not out of earnings or earned surplus; (ii) to offer for
subscription pro rata to the holders of any class or series of its stock any additional shares
of stock of any class or series or other rights; (iii) to effect any reclassification or
recapitalization of its Common Stock outstanding involving a change in the Common
Stock; or (iv) to merge or consolidate with or into any other corporation, or sell, lease or
convey all or substantially all of its assets, or to liquidate, dissolve or wind up;

of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of Preferred
Stock, voting together as a class on an as converted to Common Stock basis and (ii)
holders of at least sixty percent (60%) of the voting power of all then outstanding shares
of Series B and Series C Preferred Stock, voting together as a class on an as converted to
Common Stock basis, the Corporation shall send to the holders of Preferred Stock: (1) at

holders of Common Stock shall be entitled thereto) or for determining rights to vote, if
any, in respect of the matters referred to in (iii) and (iv) above; and (2) in the case of the
matters referred to in (iii) and (iv) above, at least twenty (20) days prior written notice of
the date when the same shall take place (and specifying the date on which the holders of
Common Stock shall be entitled to exchange their Common Stock for securities or other
property deliverable upon the occurrence of such event).

time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock;
and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall
not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock,
the Corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be
necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such
number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose, including, without limitation,
engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary
amendment to this Certificate.

m. Fractional Shares. No fractional share shall be issued upon
the conversion of any share or shares of Preferred Stock. All shares of Common Stock
(including fractions thereof) issuable upon conversion of more than one share of
Preferred Stock by a holder thereof shall be aggregated for purposes of determining
whether the conversion would result in the issuance of any fractional share. If, after the
aforementioned aggregation, the conversion would result in the issuance of a fraction of a
share of Common Stock, the Corporation shall, in lieu of issuing any fractional share, pay
the holder otherwise entitled to such fraction a sum in cash equal to the fair market value
of such fraction on the date of conversion (as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors of the Corporation).
