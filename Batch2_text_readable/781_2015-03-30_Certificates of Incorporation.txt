in full, then the amount available for distribution shall be distributed among the holders of the
Series D Preferred Stock and the Series E Preferred Stock, pro rata in accordance with the

Series B-2 Preferred Stock, an amount equal to the greater of (i) the Series B-2 Liquidation

Amount”). If upon any Liquidation Event the amount available for distribution to its
stockholders shall be insufficient to permit the payment of the Series B Liquidation Amount for

consideration to be delivered to the holders of Preferred Stock upon any Liquidation Event in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be valued as follows:

then the value shall be computed at the aggregate amount of the cash or cash equivalents so
delivered;

(ii) | The per share value of securities traded on a national
securities exchange or a nationally recognized interdealer quotation system shall be deemed to be
the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange or system over the 20-day
period ending three (3) Business Days prior to the closing of such Liquidation Event;

(iii) | The per share value of securities traded over-the-counter
shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid and asked prices over the 30-day period
ending three (3) Business Days prior to the closing of such Liquidation Event; and

(iv) For all other consideration, the value shall be the fair
market value thereof as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(v) In the event that the Requisite Stockholders dispute any
valuation determined by the Board of Directors pursuant to Section B.2(g)(iv), such holders shall
have the right to obtain an independent valuation of such property, security or other non-cash
consideration from one nationally recognized investment bank, not affiliated with any holder of
Preferred Stock, reasonably acceptable to the Corporation, and with substantial experience
pertaining to such valuations, which valuation shall be binding. Ifthe valuation determined by
such bank is within 10% of the valuation determined by the Board of Directors, the holders of
Preferred Stock requesting such valuation shall pay for the fees and expenses of such bank in
making such valuation, otherwise the Corporation shall pay such fees and expenses.

(h) Merger Agreement. The Corporation shail not have the power to

Corporation in accordance with Sections B.2(a)-B.2(d).

(i) In the event of a Sale of the Corporation, if the Corporation does not
effect a dissolution of the Corporation under the General Corporation Law within 90 days after
such Sale of the Corporation, then (i) the Corporation shall send a written notice to each holder
of Preferred Stock no later than the 90th day after the Sale of the Corporation advising such
holders of their right (and the requirements to be met to secure such right) pursuant to the terms
of the following clause (ii) to require the redemption of such shares of Preferred Stock, and (ii) if

ACTIVE/80444532.8 6
the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock so request in a written
instrument delivered to the Corporation not later than 120 days after such Sale of the
Corporation, the Corporation shall use the consideration received by the Corporation for such
Sale of the Corporation (net of any retained liabilities associated with the assets sold or
technology licensed, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors), together with any
other assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders, all to the extent
permitted by Delaware law governing distributions to stockholders (the “Available Proceeds’’),
on the 150th day after such Sale of the Corporation, to redeem all outstanding shares of Preferred
Stock at a price per share equal to the applicable Liquidation Amount. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event of a redemption pursuant to the preceding sentence, if the Available
Proceeds are not sufficient to redeem all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, the Corporation
shall ratably redeem each holder’s shares of Preferred Stock to the fullest extent of such
Available Proceeds, and shall redeem the remaining shares as soon as it may lawfully do so under
Delaware law governing distributions to stockholders. The provisions of Section B.9 shall apply,
with such necessary changes in the details thereof as are necessitated by the context, to the
redemption of the Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section B.2(i). Prior to the distribution or
redemption provided for in this Section B.2(i), the Corporation shall not expend or dissipate the
consideration received for such Sale of the Corporation, except to discharge expenses incurred in
connection with such Sale of the Corporation or in the ordinary course of business.

(j) Allocation of Escrow and Contingent Consideration. In the event ofa
Sale of the Corporation, if any portion of the consideration payable to the stockholders of the

Corporation is payable only upon satisfaction of contingencies (the “Additional
Consideration’), the Merger Agreement shall provide that (a) the portion of such consideration
that is not Additional Consideration (such portion, the “Initial Consideration”) shall be
allocated among the holders of capital stock of the Corporation in accordance with Sections
B.2(a)-B.2(d) as if the Initial Consideration were the only consideration payable in connection
with such Sale of the Corporation and (b) any Additional Consideration which becomes payable
to the stockholders of the Corporation upon satisfaction of such contingencies shall be allocated
among the holders of capital stock of the Corporation in accordance with Sections B.2(a)-B.2(d)
after taking into account the previous payment of the Initial Consideration as part of the same
transaction. For the purposes of this Section B.2(j), consideration placed into escrow or retained
as holdback to be available for satisfaction of indemnification or similar obligations in
connection with such Sale of the Corporation shall be deemed to be Additional Consideration.

3. Conversion into Common Stock. The holders of Preferred Stock shall have
the following conversion rights:

(a) Voluntary Conversion. At any time, each holder of shares of Preferred
Stock shall! be entitled, without the payment of any additional consideration, to cause all or any
portion of the shares of Preferred Stock held by such holder to be converted into a number of
shares of Common Stock determined as hereafter provided in this Section B.3(a), which shares
shall upon the issuance thereof be fully paid and non-assessable. The number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of each share of a series of Preferred Stock shall be
equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (1) the applicable Purchase Price for such series of
Preferred Stock by (ii) the applicable Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock, in each

ACTIVE/80444532.8 7
case as in effect at the time of conversion. As of the Effective Time, the “Series A Conversion
Price” per share of the Series A Preferred Stock equals the Series A Purchase Price, the “Series
B Conversion Price” per share of the Series B Preferred Stock equals the Series B Purchase
Price, the “Series B-2 Conversion Price” per share of the Series B-2 Preferred Stock equals the
Series B-2 Purchase Price, the “Series C Conversion Price” per share of the Series C Preferred
Stock equals the Series C Purchase Price, the “Series D Conversion Price” per share of the
Series D Preferred Stock equals the Series D Purchase Price, and the “Series E Conversion
Price” per share of the Series E Preferred Stock equals the Series E Purchase Price, subject in
each case to adjustment from time to time as hereinafter provided. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event, and only in the event, that shares of Series E Preferred Stock are
converted into shares of Common Stock in connection with a Qualified Public Offering (as
defined herein) consummated on or prior to March 1, 2016, the Series E Conversion Price shall
be deemed to have been equal as of the Effective Time to $1.362, subject to adjustment from
time to time as hereinafter provided. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of an adjustment to
the Series E Conversion Price on or prior to March 1, 2016, and in the event that a Qualified
Public Offering is consummated on or prior to March 1, 2016, such adjustment to the Series E
Conversion Price shall be made after giving effect to the prior sentence (meaning that the
adjustment shall be applied to the Series E Conversion Price of $1.362 and not to the Conversion
Price of $1.119), including in the event that such adjustment preceded the Qualified Public
Offering.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall
automatically be converted, without the payment of any additional consideration, into the number
of shares of Common Stock provided for in Section B.3(a) either (i) immediately upon
consummation of the Corporation’s first underwritten Public Offering of Common Stock
pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act (A) resulting in at least
$50,000,000 of gross proceeds to the Corporation, (B) reflecting a gross offering price per share
of Common Stock to the public (as equitably adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend,
combination, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other similar
event involving Common Stock) of not less than 1.2 times the Series E Purchase Price (as
equitably adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend, combination, consolidation,
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other similar event involving Common Stock),
and (C) after giving effect to which the Common Stock is listed on a U.S. national securities
exchange (a “Qualified Public Offering”), or (11) upon the written request of the Requisite
Stockholders, which must include the Requisite D/E Preferred (a “Majority Conversion”). For
purposes of this Section B.3(b) only, the “Series E Purchase Price” shall mean (i) $1.362 per
share if the closing of such Qualified Public Offering occurs on or prior to March 1, 2016, or (ii)
$1.119 per share if the closing of such Qualified Public Offering occurs at any time after March
1, 2016 (in each case, as equitably adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend,
combination, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other similar
event involving Common Stock).

(c) Procedure for Voluntary Conversion: Effective Date. Upon any

election to convert any shares of Preferred Stock made in accordance with Section B.3(a), the
holders of such shares of Preferred Stock making such election shall provide written notice of

ACTIVE/80444532.8 8g
such conversion (a “Voluntary Conversion Notice”) to the Corporation setting forth the number
of shares of Preferred Stock each such holder elects to convert into Common Stock (the “Elected
Preferred Stock”). On the date the Voluntary Conversion Notice is delivered to the
Corporation, such shares of Elected Preferred Stock shall thereupon be converted, without further
action, into the number of shares of Common Stock provided for in Section B.3(a), and such
number of shares of Common Stock into which the Elected Preferred Stock is converted shall
thereupon be deemed to have been issued to such holders of the Elected Preferred Stock. Such
holders shall as soon as practicable thereafter surrender to the Corporation at the Corporation’s
principal executive office the certificate or certificates evidencing the Elected Preferred Stock,
duly assigned or endorsed for transfer to the Corporation (or accompanied by duly executed stock
powers relating thereto), or an Affidavit of Loss with respect thereto. Upon surrender of such
certificates or delivery of an Affidavit of Loss with respect thereto, the Corporation shall issue
and deliver to the holder so surrendering such certificates or to such holder’s designee, at an
address designated by such holder, certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into
which such holder’s Elected Preferred Stock shall have been converted. The issuance of
certificates for shares of Common Stock upon conversion of Elected Preferred Stock will be
made without charge to the holders of such shares for any issuance tax in respect thereof or other
costs incurred by the Corporation in connection with such conversion and the related issuance of
such stock. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section B.3(c), in the event
that holders of shares of Preferred Stock elect to convert such shares pursuant to Section B.3(a)
in connection with any Public Offering or other specified event, (1) such conversion may at the
election of such holders be conditioned upon the consummation of such Public Offering or the
occurrence of such other specified event, in which case, such conversion shall not be deemed to
be effective until the consummation of such Public Offering or the occurrence of such other
specified event and (ii) if such Public Offering or other specified event is consummated or
occurs, all shares of Elected Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have been converted into shares
of Common Stock immediately prior thereto.

(d) Procedure for Automatic Conversion. As of the date of, and in all
cases subject to, the consummation of a Qualified Public Offering or a Majority Conversion, all
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically, without further action,
into the number of shares of Common Stock provided for in Section B.3(a), and such number of
shares of Common Stock into which such Preferred Stock is converted shall be deemed to have
been issued to the holders of such Preferred Stock, as the case may be. Such holders shall, as
soon as practicable thereafter, surrender the certificate or certificates evidencing the shares of
Preferred Stock, as the case may be, duly assigned or endorsed for transfer to the Corporation (or
accompanied by duly executed stock powers relating thereto) or an Affidavit of Loss with respect
thereto. Upon surrender of such certificates or delivery of an Affidavit of Loss with respect
thereto, the Corporation shall issue and deliver to such holder so surrendering such certificates or
to such holder’s designee, promptly (and in any event in such time as is sufficient to enable such
holder to participate in such Qualified Public Offering or Majority Conversion, as applicable) at
an address designated by such holder, certificates (or statements(s) of holdings if shares of
Common Stock are held in book-entry form) for the number of shares of Common Stock into
which such holder’s Preferred Stock shall have been converted.

ACTIVE/80444532.8 9
(e) Fractional Shares; Partial Conversion. No fractional shares shall be
issued upon conversion of any shares of Preferred Stock. All shares of Common Stock
(including fractions thereof) issuable upon conversion of shares of Preferred Stock by a holder
thereof shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the conversion would result in
the issuance of any fractional share. If any fractional interest in a share of Common Stock would,
except for the provisions of the first sentence of this paragraph (e), be delivered upon any such
conversion, the Corporation, in lieu of delivering the fractional share thereof, shall pay to the
holder surrendering the shares of Preferred Stock for conversion an amount in cash equal to the
current fair market value of such fractional interest as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors. In case the number of shares of Preferred Stock represented by the certificate or
certificates surrendered at the time of conversion exceeds the number of shares to be converted,
the Corporation shall, upon such conversion, execute and deliver to the holder thereof, at the
expense of the Corporation, a new certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Preferred
Stock represented by the certificate or certificates surrendered that are not to be converted.

4. Adjustments.

(a) Adjustments for Subdivisions, Combinations or Consolidation of
Common Stock. In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided by

stock split, stock dividends or otherwise, into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the
Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock then in effect shall, concurrently with the
effectiveness of such subdivision, be proportionately decreased so that the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable on conversion of any shares of Preferred Stock shall be increased in
proportion to such increase in outstanding shares. In the event the outstanding shares of
Common Stock shall be combined or consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser
number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock then
in effect shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination or consolidation, be
proportionately increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion
of any shares of Preferred Stock shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding
shares.

(b) Adjustments for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. Ifthe
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same

or a different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock or into any other securities
or property, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification, merger, combination of shares,
recapitalization, consolidation, business combination or other similar transaction (other than a
subdivision, consolidation or combination of shares provided for above and other than a
Liquidation Event which shall be governed by Section B.2), each share of Preferred Stock shall
thereafter be convertible into the number of shares of stock or other securities or property to
which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation deliverable upon
conversion of such share of Preferred Stock shall have been entitled upon such capital
reorganization, reclassification, merger, combination of shares, recapitalization, consolidation,
business combination or other similar transaction if immediately prior to such capital
reorganization, reclassification, merger, combination of shares, recapitalization, consolidation,
business combination or other similar transaction such holder had converted such holder’s
Preferred Stock into Common Stock. The provisions of this Section B.4(b) shall similarly apply

ACTIVE/80444532.8 10
to outstanding shares of Preferred Stock at the time of any successive capital reorganizations,
reclassifications, mergers, combinations of shares, recapitalizations, consolidations, business
combinations or other similar transactions. The Corporation shal! not effect any Sale of the
Corporation that is not, in accordance with Section B.2(b), a Liquidation Event unless prior to or
simultaneously with the consummation thereof the successor corporation or purchaser, as the
case may be, shall assume by written instrument the obligation to deliver to the holders of
Preferred Stock, securities or assets as, in accordance with the foregoing provisions, each such
holder is entitled to receive.

(c) Adjustment of the Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional
Shares of Common Stock. In the event the Corporation shall on or at any time following the

Effective Time issue or sell, or in accordance with Section B.4(e) is deemed to have issued or
sold, any shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities without consideration or for a
consideration per share of Common Stock less than the applicable Conversion Price for any
series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such issue or sale, then and in such event,
such applicable Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue or sale, to a
price (calculated to the nearest whole cent) determined by the following formula:

P =P1Q1+P202
Qi +Q2

Where:

P = the applicable Conversion Price for such series of
Preferred Stock in effect immediately following and
after giving effect to such issue or sale

Pl = the applicable Conversion Price for such series of
Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such
issue or sale

Ql = the number of shares of Common Stock Deemed
Outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale

P2 = the consideration per share, if any, received or
receivable by the Corporation on account of such issue
or sale

Q2 = _ the number of shares of Common Stock so issued or

sold or, in accordance with Section B.4(e), deemed to
have been issued or sold

(d) Multiple Closing Dates. In the event the Corporation shall issue on
more than one date additional shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities as part of one
transaction or a series of related transactions, and such issuance dates occur within a period of no
more than 60 days, then, upon the final such issuance (or at the time of any conversion, if

ACTIVE/80444532.8 11
earlier), the applicable Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock shall be readjusted to
give effect to all such issuances as if they occurred on the date of the final such issuance (and
without giving effect to any adjustments as a result of such prior issuances within such period).

(e) Effect of Certain Events on Conversion Prices. For purposes of
determining the adjusted Conversion Price with respect to any series of Preferred Stock under
Section B.4(c), the following shall be applicable:

(i) Issuance of Convertible Securities.

(A) If the Corporation in any manner grants, issues or sells
any Convertible Securities, whether or not the rights to exercise, convert or exchange any such
Convertible Securities are immediately exercisable, and the price per share for which Common
Stock is issuable upon such exercise, conversion or exchange is less than any Conversion Price in
effect immediately prior to the time of such grant, issue or sale, then the maximum number of
shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the Corporation
at the time of the grant, issue or sale of such Convertible Securities for such price per share.

(B) For the purposes of this paragraph, the “price per share
for which Common Stock is issuable” in connection with the issuance of Convertible Securities
shall be determined by dividing (x) the total amount received or receivable by the Corporation as
consideration for the grant, issue or sale of such Convertible Securities, plus the cumulative
minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to the Corporation upon
the exercise, conversion or exchange thereof and, if applicable, the exercise, conversion and
exchange of any other Convertible Securities that such Convertible Securities may be converted
into or exercised or exchanged for (in each case, as set forth in the instruments and agreements
relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of
such consideration), by (y) the total maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
the exercise, conversion or exchange of all such Convertible Securities (as set forth in the
instruments and agreements relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein
for a subsequent adjustment of such number). No further adjustment of any Conversion Price
shall be made when Common Stock and, if applicable, any other Convertible Securities, are
actually issued upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities.

(C) If the Corporation issues any Convertible Securities that
entitle the holder thereof, inter alia, both (i) to exercise, convert or exchange the same into or for
Common Stock or otherwise to participate with the holders of Common Stock in distributions
upon the occurrence of a Liquidation Event and (11) in connection with or following such
exercise, conversion or exchange, to receive payment of a fixed or defined sum (such securities
being referred to herein as “Qualified Convertible Securities” and such fixed or defined sum
being referred to as the “Preference Payment”), the “total maximum number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of all such Convertible
Securities” for purposes of clause (y) of Section B.4(e)(i)(B) above shall include, in addition to
the total maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or
exchange of all such Convertible Securities, a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the

ACTIVE/80444532.8 12
quotient of (A) the aggregate Preference Payments of all such Qualified Convertible Securities so
issued, divided by (B) the total amount received or receivable by the Corporation as
consideration for the issue of one of such Qualified Convertible Securities (as set forth in the
instruments and agreements relating thereto).

(ii) | Change in Exercise Price or Conversion Rate. Ifthe
additional consideration payable to the Corporation upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of

any Convertible Securities, or the rate at which any Convertible Securities are convertible into or
exchangeable for Common Stock should change at any time, each Conversion Price that is in
effect at the time of such change that was adjusted in accordance with Section B.4(e)(i) upon the
issuance of such Convertible Securities shall be readjusted to the Conversion Price that would
have been in effect at such time had such Convertible Securities that are still outstanding
provided for such changed additional consideration or changed conversion rate, as the case may
be, at the time such Convertible Securities were initially granted, issued or sold; and on the
termination date of any right to exercise, convert or exchange such Convertible Securities
without such right having been exercised, each Conversion Price then in effect hereunder shall be
adjusted to the Conversion Price that would have been in effect at the time of such termination
had such Convertible Securities, to the extent outstanding immediately prior to such termination,
never been issued.

(iii) Exceptions for Excluded Securities. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no adjustments shall be made under Sections B.4(c), (d) and/or (e) with respect to the
issue, grant or sale of any Excluded Securities.

(iv) Valuation of Non-Cash Consideration. The consideration
received by the Corporation for the issue of any shares of Common Stock, Convertible Securities
or any other Convertible Securities that such Convertible Securities may be converted into or
exercised or exchanged for shall be computed in accordance with Section B.2(g).

(f) Other Dilutive Issuances. If an event not specified in this Section B.4
(other than the issuance of Excluded Securities) occurs that has substantially the same economic
effect on any series of Preferred Stock as those events specifically enumerated above in this
Section B.4, then this Section B.4 shall be construed liberally, mutatis mutandis, in order to
provide the holders of such series of Preferred Stock the intended benefit of the protections
provided under this Section B.4. In such event, the Board of Directors shall make an appropriate
adjustment in each applicable Conversion Price so as to protect the rights of the holders of such
series of Preferred Stock; provided that no such adjustment (other than in accordance with an
event in the nature of a combination or consolidation of the Common Stock) shall increase the
applicable Conversion Price above the applicable Purchase Price for such series of Preferred
Stock as otherwise determined pursuant to this Section B.4 or decrease the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of each share of Preferred Stock as otherwise
determined in accordance with this Section B.4.

(g) No Impairment. The Corporation will not, by amendment of this

Certificate of Incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation,
merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to

ACTIVE/80444532.8 13
avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder
by the Corporation, and will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the
provisions of this Section B.4 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or
appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holders of Preferred Stock hereunder
against impairment by the Corporation or any successor entities. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing in this Section B.4(g) shall prohibit the Corporation from amending this Certificate of
Incorporation with the requisite consent of its stockholders in accordance with Section C.4 and
the approval of the Board.

(h) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment
or readjustment of any Conversion Price pursuant to this Section B.4, the Corporation at its
expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms
hereof and furnish to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or
readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is
based and the applicable Conversion Price then in effect. The Corporation shall, upon the
written request at any time by any holder of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to
such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and readjustments, (ii) the
Conversion Price at the time in effect, and (ii1) the number of shares of Common Stock and the
amount, if any, of other property that at the time would be received upon the conversion of such
holder’s Preferred Stock.

(i) Rounding. All calculations under this Section B.4 shall be made to
(i) the nearest one cent or (ii) the nearest share, as the case may be. All calculations of
percentages, if any, shall be carried to three decimal points but shall not be rounded up or down.

(j) Limitations on Adjustments. Anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, no adjustment in the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock shall be
required unless such adjustment, either by itself or with other adjustments not previously made,
would require a change of at least $0.0001 in such Conversion Price; provided, however, that any
adjustment which by reason of this paragraph (j) is not required to be made shall be carried
forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment or immediately prior to any
conversion.

5. Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at
all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock,

solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the issued or issuable shares of Preferred
Stock, such number of its shares of Common Stock, as the case may be, as shall from time to
time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, and if at
any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient
to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, the Corporation will
take all such corporate action as may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares
of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.

6. No Closing of Transfer Books. The Corporation shall not close its books

against the transfer of shares of Preferred Stock in any manner that would interfere with the
timely conversion of any shares of Preferred Stock in accordance with the provisions hereof.

ACTIVE/80444532.8 14
7. Notice.

(a) Liquidation Events, Extraordinary Transactions, Etc. In the event
(i) the Corporation establishes a record date to determine the holders of any class of securities

who are entitled to receive any dividend or other distribution or who are entitled to vote at a
meeting (or by written consent) in connection with any Liquidation Event or (ii) any Liquidation
Event is approved by the Board of Directors or the Corporation enters into any agreement with
respect thereto, the Corporation shall mail or cause to be mailed by first class mail (postage
prepaid) to each holder of Preferred Stock at least ten (10) days prior to such record date
specified therein or the expected effective date of any such transaction, a notice specifying

(A) such record date for the purpose of such dividend or distribution or meeting or consent and a
description of such dividend or distribution or the action to be taken at such meeting or by such
consent, (B) the date on which any such Liquidation Event is expected to become effective and,
in the case of a Sale of the Corporation, the identity of the parties thereto, and (C) the date on
which the books of the Corporation shall close or a record shall be taken with respect to any such
event.

(b) Waiver of Notice. The Requisite Stockholders, which must include
the Requisite D/E Preferred, may, at any time upon written notice to the Corporation, waive,
either prospectively or retrospectively, any notice provisions specified herein, and any such
waiver shall be effective as to all holders of Preferred Stock.

(c) General. In the event that the Corporation provides any notice, report
or statement to holders of Common Stock, the Corporation shall at the same time provide a copy
of any such notice, report or statement to each holder of outstanding Preferred Stock.

8. No Reissuance of Preferred Stock. No share or shares of Preferred Stock
acquired by the Corporation by reason of redemption, purchase, conversion or otherwise shall be
reissued, and all such shares shall be canceled, retired and eliminated from the shares that the
Corporation shall be authorized to issue.

9. Redemption.

(a) The Preferred Stock may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the
option of the holders of such Preferred Stock pursuant to redemption proceedings which must
first be initiated by the Requisite Stockholders, which must include the Requisite D/E Preferred,
at any time on or after the fifth anniversary of the Effective Time. In any such case, the Requisite
Stockholders, which must include the Requisite D/E Preferred, shall notify the Corporation in
writing (the “Redemption Notice’) of their election to exercise the rights afforded by this
Section B.9 (including as to any shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock
held by any such holders). Upon receipt of the Redemption Notice, the Corporation shall
promptly notify the remaining holders of the Preferred Stock thereof. Any holder of Preferred
Stock that did not deliver the Redemption Notice may, at such holder’s option, then submit to the
Corporation, within thirty (30) days following receipt of the notice from the Corporation, notice
of intent and election to seek redemption of all or any part of their Preferred Stock (the
“Secondary Redemption Notice”) and such Secondary Redemption Notice shall be deemed to

ACTIVE/80444532.8 15
have been delivered on the same date that the Redemption Notice was delivered. The redemption
price for each share of Preferred Stock shall be cash in an amount equal to the applicable
Liquidation Preference for such series of Preferred Stock (the “Redemption Price”). The
Redemption Price shall be payable by the Corporation to holders of the Preferred Stock in three
equal annual installments the first such installment being due no later than the ninetieth (90th)
day following the receipt of the Redemption Notice and on the anniversary of such first
installment thereafter.

(b) If the funds of the Corporation legally available for redemption of its
shares are insufficient to redeem the total number of outstanding shares of Preferred Stock for
which redemption was elected, then the funds available for redemption shall be used to redeem
the Preferred Stock as follows: (i) first, the holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock and
Series D Preferred Stock for which redemption was elected shall share ratably in any funds
legally therefor according to the respective amounts that would be payable with respect to the full
number of shares of Series E Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock owned by them if all
such outstanding shares were redeemed in full; (ii) second, the holders of shares of Series C
Preferred Stock and Series B-2 Preferred Stock for which redemption was elected shall share
ratably in any funds legally therefor according to the respective amounts that would be payable
with respect to the full number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock and Series B-2 Preferred
Stock owned by them if all such outstanding shares were redeemed in full; and (iii) the holders of
shares of Series B Preferred Stock and Series A Preferred Stock for which redemption was
elected shall share ratably in any funds legally therefor according to the respective amounts that
would be payable with respect to the full number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock and Series
A Preferred Stock owned by them if all such outstanding shares were redeemed in full. At any
time thereafter when additional funds of the Corporation are legally available for the redemption
of such shares of Preferred Stock, such funds will be used at the earliest permissible time to
redeem the balance of such shares, or such portion thereof for which funds are then legally
available. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall any shares of Series C Preferred Stock or
Series B-2 Preferred Stock be redeemed prior to redemption of all of the shares of Series E
Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock which the holders of such shares of Series E
Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock, respectively, have elected to redeem pursuant to
Section B.9{a). The Corporation shall be obligated to use its best efforts to take such actions as
may be necessary (including, without limitation, the issuance of additional equity securities, the
revaluation or recapitalization of the Corporation or the consummation of Sale of the Corporation
in order to permit the full and timely redemption of the shares of Preferred Stock for which
redemption was elected).

(c) Until the holders of shares of Preferred Stock have received in cash
payment in full of all amounts provided in this Section B.9, any such shares of Preferred Stock
shall not be considered redeemed. Such unredeemed shares shall remain outstanding and shall
continue to have all rights and preferences (including, without limitation, dividend, conversion
and voting rights) provided for herein; provided, however, that the holders of such unredeemed
shares shall have the ongoing right to be redeemed, together with such rights and remedies as
may be available under applicable law, at each such holder’s election either (i) to have such
holder’s remaining outstanding shares of Preferred Stock redeemed, or (ii) rescind the

ACTIVE/80444532.8 16
Redemption Notice with respect to all or any portion of such unredeemed shares and to continue
holding such shares, free of any right of the Corporation to redeem such shares

(d) The notices provided for in this Section B.9 shall be sent, if by or on
behalf of the Corporation, to the holders of the Preferred Stock at their respective addresses as
shall then appear on the records of the Corporation, or if by any holder of Preferred Stock to the
Corporation, at its principal executive office or registered office in Delaware, by first class mail,
postage prepaid, and (1) in the case of a Redemption Notice or Secondary Redemption Notice,
shall contain the number of shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed, and (ii) in the case of any
notice by or on behalf of the Corporation, stating the place or places and time at which the shares
called for redemption shall, upon presentation and surrender of such certificates representing
such shares, be redeemed and the redemption price therefor.

C. VOTING; ELECTION OF DIRECTORS; EXIT TRANSACTION,

1. Voting Generally. Except as expressly set forth herein, the holder of each
share of Preferred Stock shall vote with holders of Common Stock, voting together as a single
class on an as-converted basis, upon all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. For such
purpose, each holder of any share of a series of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to the number of
votes per share of such series of Preferred Stock as equals the largest number of shares of
Common Stock into which each share of such series of Preferred Stock may be converted
pursuant to Section B.3 on the record date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to
vote or on the effective date of any written consent of stockholders, as applicable. In determining
the number of shares into which shares of any series of Preferred Stock may be converted for
purposes of the preceding sentence, the applicable Conversion Price shall be deemed to be the
applicable Purchase Price of such series of Preferred Stock (as equitably adjusted to reflect any
stock split, stock dividend, combination, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification or other similar event involving Common Stock), rather than any imputed
Conversion Price to be determined in the event of a Qualified Public Offering (as defined
herein) consummated on or prior to March 1, 2016. Fractional votes shall not, however, be
permitted and any fractional voting rights resulting from the above formula with respect to any
holder of Preferred Stock shall be rounded to the nearest whole number (with one-half rounded
upward to one). Notwithstanding Section 228(a) of the DGCL and except as otherwise provided
herein, no action that is required by the DGCL to be taken by stockholders at any annual or
special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation or that may be taken by stockholders at any
annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation may be taken without a meeting,
without prior notice and without a vote unless a consent or consents in writing setting forth the
action so taken shall be signed by the Requisite Stockholders which must include the Requisite
D/E Preferred if such consent or consents would adversely affect the rights of the Series D
Preferred Stock or the Series E Preferred Stock under this Section C.1. of Article 1V. There shall
be no cumulative voting.

2. Board of Directors. The Corporation’s board of directors (the “Board” or
the “Board of Directors”) shall be elected as follows:

(a) two directors of the Corporation shall be elected by the

ACTIVE/80444532.8 17
holders of Common Stock, voting separately as a single class for such purpose;

(b) one director of the Corporation shall be elected by the
holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, voting separately as a single class for such purpose (such
director being referred to as the “Series A Director’);

(c) two directors of the Corporation shall be elected by the
holders of the Series B-2 Preferred Stock, voting separately as a single class for such purpose
(such directors being referred to as the “Series B-2 Directors”);

(d) one director of the Corporation shall be elected by the
holders of the Series C Preferred Stock, voting separately as a single class for such purpose (such
director being referred to as the “Series C Director”);

(d) two directors of the Corporation shall be elected by the
holders of the Series E Preferred Stock, voting separately as a single class for such purpose (such
directors being referred to as the “Series E Directors’); and

(e) one director of the Corporation shall be elected by the
holders of the Preferred Stock and Common Stock, voting together as a single class, on an as-
converted basis for such purpose.

3. Election of Directors. The election of any director as provided in Section D.2
above by the holders of the shares of the class or series of Capital Stock entitled to elect such
director or directors shall occur (i) at the annual meeting of stockholders, (ii) at any special
meeting of stockholders, (iii) at any special meeting of holders of the shares of the class or series
of Capital Stock entitled to elect such director or directors called by the holders of not less than a
majority of such class or series then outstanding or (iv) by the written consent of holders of not
less than a majority of the shares of the class or series of Capital Stock entitled to elect such
director or directors then outstanding. Any director elected as provided in Section C.2 may be
removed at any time with or without cause by and only by the requisite vote or written consent of
the holders of the shares of the class or series of Capital Stock entitled to elect such director or
directors, and any vacancy occurring by reason of such removal or by reason of the death,
resignation or inability to serve of any such director, shall be filled by and only by a vote or
written consent of the holders of the shares of the class or series of Capital Stock entitled to elect
such director or directors. Any director so elected shall serve until such director’s successor is
duly elected and qualified, or such director’s earlier death, resignation or removal by the holders
of the shares of the class or series of Capital Stock entitled to elect such director or directors.

4. Special Approval Rights.

(a) Approval Rights of the Requisite Holders. So long as any shares of
Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the affirmative vote or consent of the Requisite Stockholders

shall be necessary to authorize the Corporation to take any of the following actions, either
directly or indirectly, whether by merger, consolidation, or otherwise (together with those actions

ACTIVE/80444532.8 18
set forth in Sections C.4(b), (c) and (d) below, the “Restricted Actions”), and any such action
taken or transaction entered into without such consent or vote shall be null and void ab initio:

series of Preferred Stock; or

(ii) | Authorize, or increase the authorized number of shares of,

transaction or series of related transactions) of all or substantially all of the assets of such
Subsidiary, unless approved by the Board, including a majority of the then-sitting Preferred
Directors.

(b) Approval Rights of the Series D Preferred Stock. So long as any
shares of Series D Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the Corporation shall not, either directly

or indirectly, by amendment, merger, consolidation or otherwise, do any of the following without
(in addition to any other vote required by law or the Certificate of Incorporation) the written
consent or affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series D
Preferred Stock, given in writing or by vote at a meeting, consenting or voting (as the case may
be) separately as a class, and any such act or transaction entered into without such consent or
vote shall be null and void aé initio, and of no force or effect:

(i) Amend, alter or repeal any provision of the Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws of the Corporation in a manner that alters the powers, preferences or
rights of the Series D Preferred Stock; provided, however, that the authorization and/or creation
of a new series of Preferred Stock which is junior to, pari passu with, or senior to, the Series D
Preferred Stock shall not in and of itself be deemed to adversely affect the powers, preferences or
rights of the Series D Preferred Stock;

(ii) | Increase or decrease the authorized number of shares of
Series D Preferred Stock;

(iii) (A) Reclassify, alter or amend any existing security of the
Corporation that is pari passu with the Series D Preferred Stock in respect of the distribution of

or rights of redemption, if such reclassification, alteration or amendment would render such other
security senior to the Series D Preferred Stock in respect of any such right, preference or
privilege, or (B) reclassify, alter or amend any existing security of the Corporation that is junior
to the Series D Preferred Stock in respect of the distribution of assets on the liquidation,

employment or service at the lower of the original purchase price or the then-current fair market
value thereof; or

ACTIVE/80444532.8 20
(v) Consummate any merger or other transaction with a
Subsidiary, other than pursuant to the terms of a transaction between a Subsidiary and the
Corporation whereby the Corporation’s stockholders immediately prior to such transaction
continue to hold Capital Securities in the same proportion and having the same economic rights,
privileges and preferences immediately following such transaction, if such transaction would,
directly or indirectly, have the impact of adversely affecting the rights, preferences and privileges
of the Series D Preferred Stock set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation or would result in any
shares of Series D Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to such transaction not being
outstanding immediately following such transaction.

(c) Approval Rights of the Series E Preferred Stock. So long as any
shares of Series E Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the Corporation shall not, either directly

or indirectly, by amendment, merger, consolidation or otherwise, do any of the following without
(in addition to any other vote required by law or the Certificate of Incorporation) the written
consent or affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series E
Preferred Stock, given in writing or by vote at a meeting, consenting or voting (as the case may

(i) Amend, alter or repeal any provision of the Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws of the Corporation in a manner that alters the powers, preferences or
rights of the Series E Preferred Stock; provided, however, that the authorization and/or creation

(ii) | Increase or decrease the authorized number of shares of
Series E Preferred Stock;

(iii) (A) Reclassify, alter or amend any existing security of the
Corporation that is pari passu with the Series E Preferred Stock in respect of the distribution of
assets on the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the payment of dividends
or rights of redemption, if such reclassification, alteration or amendment would render such other
security senior to the Series E Preferred Stock in respect of any such right, preference or
privilege, or (B) reclassify, alter or amend any existing security of the Corporation that is junior
to the Series E Preferred Stock in respect of the distribution of assets on the liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the payment of dividends or rights of redemption,
if such reclassification, alteration or amendment would render such other security senior to or
