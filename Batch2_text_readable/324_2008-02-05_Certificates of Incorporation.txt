adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations or splits with respect to such shares), plus all
accrued but unpaid dividends thereon, if any. If the assets and funds thus distributed among the

full aforesaid preferential amounts, then the entire assets and funds of the Corporation legally
available for distribution following payment of the full amounts due pursuant to Sections 2(a)
and 2(b) of this Article IV(B) shall be distributed ratably among the holders of Series C Preferred

outstanding shares of Common Stock held by each holder thereof (assuming full conversion of
all such Series 2 Preferred and Series 1 Preferred).

(g) Each of the following transactions shall be deemed to be a
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation as those terms are used in this Article
IV(B\2): (a) any reorganization, consolidation, merger or similar transaction or similar series of
related transactions (each, a “Combination Transaction”) in which the Corporation is a
constituent corporation or is a party if, as a result of such Combination Transaction, the voting
securities of the Corporation that are outstanding immediately prior to the consummation of such
Combination Transaction (other than any such securities that are held by an “Acquiring
Shareholder’, as defined below) do not represent, or are not converted into, securities of the

GDSVF&H\860384.4 -5-
surviving corporation of such Combination Transaction (or such surviving corporation’s parent
corporation if the surviving corporation is owned by the parent corporation) that, immediately
after the consummation of such Combination Transaction, together possess at least a majority of
the total voting power of all securities of such surviving corporation (or its parent corporation, if
applicable) that are outstanding immediately after the consummation of such Combination
Transaction, including securities of such surviving corporation (or its parent corporation, if
applicable) that are held by the Acquiring Shareholder; or (b) a sale or exclusive license of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Corporation; provided, however, that an equity financing for
cash raising purposes in which the Corporation is the surviving corporation shall not be
considered a Combination Transaction. For purposes of this Article [V(B)(2), an “Acquiring
Shareholder” means a stockholder or stockholders of the Corporation that (i) merges or combines
with the Corporation in such Combination Transaction or (ii) owns or controls a majority of
another corporation that merges or combines with the Corporation in such Combination
Transaction.

(h) _Inany of such events, if the consideration received by the
Corporation is other than cash, its value will be deemed its fair market value. Any securities
shall be valued as follows:

(i) Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar
restrictions on free marketability:

(A) If traded ona securities exchange or through
NASDAQ-NMS, the value shall be deemed to be the
average of the closing prices of the securities on such
exchange over the thirty (30) day period ending three (3)
days prior to the closing;

(B) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices
(whichever is applicable) over the thirty (30) day period
ending three (3) days prior to the closing; and

(C) If there is no active public market, the value shall] be the
fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by the
Corporation and the holders of a majority of the Series 2
Preferred.

(ii) The method of valuation of securities subject to investment
letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of
a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount
from the market value determined as above in (i) (A), (B) or (C) to reflect the approximate fair
market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Corporation and the holders of a majority of
the Series 2 Preferred.

Preferred (the “Series C Conversion Rate”) shall be the quotient obtained by dividing $12.90 by
the Series C Conversion Price, calculated as provided in Article IV(B)(3)(c). The conversion rate
in effect at any time for conversion of the Series 1 Preferred (the “Series 1 Conversion Rate”)
shall be the quotient obtained by dividing $0.4757 by the Series 1 Conversion Price, calculated as
provided in Article IV(B)(3)(c). The conversion rate in effect at any time for conversion of the

(d) Automatic Conversion.

(i) Each outstanding share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock,
Series A-2 Preferred Stock, Series A-3 Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C
Preferred Stock (collectively, the “Special Mandatory Conversion Stock”), including those shares
issuable upon the exercise of then outstanding warrants or other stock purchase rights, shall
automatically, and without any further action on the part of such holder, be converted into shares
of Common Stock at the applicable Conversion Price at the time in effect for such series of
Preferred Stock at 12:0] a.m. (Eastern Standard Time) on the third (3) business day following
the Accredited Investor Closing (as defined in that certain Series 2 Preferred Stock Purchase
Agreement (the “Series 2 Purchase Agreement”) entered into by the Company and certain third
parties on or around the Filing Date, a copy of which will be provided to each stockholder of the
corporation upon written request therefor). Upon such conversion, any shares of Special
Mandatory Conversion Stock so converted shall be cancelled and not subject to reissuance.
Upon a the conversion described in this Article IV(B)(3)(d)(i) , each holder of shares of Special
Mandatory Conversion Stock converted pursuant to this Article IV(B)(3)(d)(i) above shall
surrender his, her or its certificate or certificates for all such shares to the Corporation at the
place designated in a notice to be provided to such holders, and shall thereafter receive
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to this Article [V(B)(3)(d)(i) . All rights with respect to the Special Mandatory Conversion Stock
converted pursuant to Article [V(B)(3)(d)(i) , including the rights, if any, to receive notices and
vote (other than as a holder of Common Stock), will terminate, except only the rights of the
holders thereof, upon surrender of their certificate or certificates therefor, to receive certificates
for the number of shares of Common Stock into which such Special Mandatory Conversion
Stock has been converted, and payment of any declared but unpaid dividends thereon. If so
required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or
accompanied by written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the
Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or by his, her or its attorney duly authorized

GDS VF&H\860384.4 -8-

in writing. As soon as practicable after the conversion described in this Article 1V(B)(3)(d)(i)
and the surrender of the certificate or certificates for the Special Mandatory Conversion Stock,
the Corporation shall cause to be issued and delivered to such holder, or on his, her or its written
order, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable on such
conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof and cash in respect of any fraction of a share
of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion. All certificates evidencing shares of
Special Mandatory Conversion Stock cancelled, and the shares of Special Mandatory Conversion
Stock converted pursuant to this Article IV(B)(3)(d)(i) represented thereby shall, from and after
the time of the conversion, be deemed to have been converted into Common Stock for all
purposes, notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender such
certificates on or prior to such date. The Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate action
(without the need for stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of
shares of Special Mandatory Conversion Stock accordingly.

(ii) | Each share of Series 1 Preferred and Series 2 Preferred
shall be automatically converted into shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Price at the
time in effect for such share immediately upon the earlier of (i) except as provided in Article
TV(B)(3)(e) below, the Corporation’s sale of its Common Stock in a firm commitment
underwritten public offering pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, the aggregate public offering price of which is not less than $25,000,000 at a
price per share not less than $5.00 (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends,
recapitalizations or the like) (a “Qualified IPO”) or (ii) the date specified by written consent of
the holders of a majority of then outstanding Series 2 Preferred.

(e) Mechanics of Conversion. For the purposes of Article IV(B)
(3)(d)(ii), before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into shares of
Common Stock, he shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the
office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, and shall give written
notice to the Corporation at its principal corporate office of the election to convert the same and
shall state therein the name or names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of
Common Stock are to be issued. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue
and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or nominees of
such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such
holder shall be entitled as aforesaid. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made
immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred
Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of
such shares of Common Stock as of such date. If the conversion is in connection with an
underwritten offering of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act, the conversion may,
at the option of any holder tendering Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the
closing with the underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering, in which event
the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall
not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of
such sale of securities.

(f) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock for Certain
Dilutive Issuances, Splits and Combinations. The Conversion Price of any series of the Series 1
Preferred and Series 2 Preferred shall be subject to adjustment, as applicable, from time to time
as follows:

(i) (A) Ifthe Corporation shall issue, after the filing date
of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Filing Date”) any Additional
Stock (as defined below) without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the
Conversion Price for Series 2 Preferred in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such
Additional Stock, the Conversion Price for the Series 2 Preferred in effect immediately prior to
each such issuance shall forthwith (except as otherwise provided in this clause (i)) be adjusted to
a price determined by multiplying such Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction, (x) the
numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to such issuance (the “Outstanding Common’) plus the number of shares of Common Stock
that the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for such issuance would purchase at
such Conversion Price; and (y) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of
Outstanding Common plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock. For purposes of the
foregoing calculation, the term Outstanding Common Shall include shares of Common Stock
deemed issued pursuant to Article IV(B)(3)(f){i)(E) below.

(B) No adjustment of the Conversion Price for any series of
Series 2 Preferred shall be made in an amount less than one tenth of one cent ($0.001) per share,
provided that any adjustments which are not required to be made by reason of this sentence shall
be carried forward and shall be taken into account in any subsequent adjustment made prior to
three (3) years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward.
Except to the limited extent provided for in subsections (E)(3) and (E)(4) below, no adjustment
of such Conversion Price pursuant to this Article 1V(B)(3)(f)(i) shall have the effect of increasing
such Conversion Price above the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such
adjustment,

(C) Inthe case of the issuance of Common Stock for cash, the
consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting any
reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the
Corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

(D) Inthe case of the issuance of Common Stock for a
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be
deemed to be the fair value thereof as determined by the Board of Directors irrespective of any
accounting treatment.

(E) In the case of the issuance (whether before, on or after the
Filing Date) of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common Stock, securities by their
terms convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock or options to purchase or rights to

(1) The aggregate maximum number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable upon exercise (assuming the satisfaction of any
conditions to exercisability, including without limitation, the passage of time, but
without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) of such options to
purchase or rights to subscribe for Common Stock shall be deemed to have been
issued at the time such options or rights were issued and for a consideration equal
to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in Article V(B)(3)()
(C) and (£)(i)(D)), if any, received by the Corporation upon the issuance of such
options or rights plus the minimum exercise price provided in such options or
rights (without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) for the
Common Stock covered thereby.

(2) The aggregate maximum number of shares of

antidilution adjustments) for any such convertible or exchangeable securities or
upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible

rights (excluding any cash received on account of accrued interest or accrued
dividends), plus the minimum additional consideration, if any, to be received by
the Corporation (without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments)

(3) In the event of any change in the number of shares
of Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to the Corporation
upon exercise of such options or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for

exercise of any such options or rights or the conversion or exchange of such
securities.

(4) Upon the expiration of any such options or rights,

the termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any
options or rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the

-11-
Conversion Price of the Series 2 Preferred, to the extent in any way affected by or

remain in effect) actually issued upon the exercise of such options or rights, upon
the conversion or exchange of such securities or upon the exercise of the options
or rights related to such securities.

(5) The number of shares of Common Stock deemed

(ii) | “Additional Stock” shall mean any shares of Common
Stock issued (or deemed to have been issued pursuant to Article TV(B)(3)(f)(i)(E)) by the
Corporation after the Filing Date other than:

(A) Common Stock issued pursuant to a transaction described
in Article [V(B)(3)(f(iii) hereof;

connection with the merger of the Corporation effected solely for the purpose of reincorporation;
and

(1) shares of Common Stock excluded from the definition of
Additional Stock by the affirmative written consent of the holders of a majority of the Series 2
Preferred Stock.

(iii) | In the event the Corporation should at any time or from
time to time after the Filing Date fix a record date for the effectuation of a split or subdivision of
the outstanding shares of Common Stock or the determination of holders of Common Stock
entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock
or other securities or rights convertible into, or entitling the holder thereof to receive directly or
indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock (hereinafter referred to as “Common Stock
Equivalents”) without payment of any consideration by such holder for the additional shares of
Common Stock or the Common Stock Equivalents (including the additional shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof), then, as of such record date (or the date of
such dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no record date is fixed), the Conversion Price of
each series of Preferred Stock shall be appropriately decreased so that the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of Preferred Stock shall be increased in
proportion to such increase, with the number of shares issuable with respect to Common Stock
Equivalents determined from time to time in the manner provided for deemed issuances in

Article IV(B)3)OOE).

(iv) Ifthe number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at
any time after the Filing Date is decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock, then, following the record date of such combination, the Conversion Price for
each series of Preferred Stock shall be appropriately increased so that the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of Preferred Stock shall be decreased in
proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares.

(g) Other Distributions. Subject to any applicable restrictions in
Article IV(B)(1), in the event the Corporation shall declare a distribution payable in securities of
other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by the Corporation or other persons, assets
(excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred to in Article IV(B)(3)(A(iii), then, in
each such case for the purpose of this Article IV(B)(3)(g), the holders of Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to a proportionate share of any such distribution as though they were the holders of the
number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation into which their shares of Preferred Stock
are convertible as of the record date fixed for the determination of the holders of Common Stock
of the Corporation entitled to receive such distribution.

(h) _Recapitalizations. If at any time or from time to time there shall be
a recapitalization of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision, combination or merger or sale
of assets transaction provided for elsewhere in this Article IV(B)(3) or Article IV(B)(2)),
provision shall be made so that the holders of Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to

GDSVF&H\860384.4 -13-

receive upon conversion of the Preferred Stock the number of shares of stock or other securities
or property of the Corporation or otherwise, to which a holder of the Common Stock that would
have been deliverable upon conversion of such Preferred Stock would have been entitled on such
recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the
provisions of this Article [V(B)(3) with respect to the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock
after the recapitalization to the end that the provisions of this Article [V(B)(3) (including
adjustment of the Conversion Prices then in effect and the number of shares purchasable upon
conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event as nearly equivalent as may
be practicable.

(i) Reorganizations, Mergers and Consolidations. If at any time or
from time to time after the Filing Date there is a reorganization of the Corporation (other than a
recapitalization, subdivision, combination, reclassification or exchange of shares provided for in
Article IV(B)(3)(h)) or a merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into another
corporation (except an event that is governed under Article IV(B)(2)(d)), then, as a part of such
reorganization, merger or consolidation, provision shall be made so that the holders of the
Preferred Stock thereafter shall be entitled to receive, upon conversion of the Preferred Stock, the
number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the Corporation, or of such successor
corporation resulting from such reorganization, merger or consolidation, to which a holder of
Common Stock deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled on such reorganization,
merger or consolidation. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the
application of the provisions of this 1V(B)(3)(i) with respect to the rights of the holders of the
Preferred Stock after the reorganization, merger or consolidation to the end that the provisions of
this Article [V(B)(3)() (including adjustment of the Conversion Prices then in effect and number
of shares issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event and
be as nearly equivalent to the provisions hereof as may be practicable. This Article IV (B)(3)()
shall similarly apply to successive reorganizations, mergers and consolidations.

(j) Reserved.

(k) No Impairment. The Corporation will not, by amendment of its
Certificate of Incorporation or through any reorganization, recapitalization, transfer of assets,
consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid
or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed
hereunder by the Corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all
the provisions of this Article [V(B)(3) and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or
appropriate in order to protect the Conversion Rights of the holders of Series A-1 Preferred,
Series A-2 Preferred, Series A-3 Preferred, Series B Preferred, Series C Preferred, Series 1
Preferred and Series 2 Preferred against impairment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in
this Article IV(B)(iii)(k) shall prohibit the Corporation from amending its Certificate of
Incorporation with the requisite consent of its stockholders and the Board of Directors.

(l) No Fractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments.

GDSVF&H\860384.4 -14-
(i) No fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of
any share or shares of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock pursuant to this
Article IV(B)(3). If more than one (1) certificate shall be surrendered for conversion at any one
time by the same holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion
thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares so surrendered. Each
holder of shares of Preferred Stock converted into Common Stock who would otherwise be
entitled to a fraction of a share of Common Stock shall receive cash (rounded to the nearest
whole cent) equal to the fair market value of a share of Common Stock as determined (in good
faith) by the Board of Directors multiplied by such fractional interest.

(ii) | Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of
the Conversion Price of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Article IV(B)(3), the Corporation, at its
expense, shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms
hereof and prepare and furnish to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such
adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or
readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder
of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth
(A) such adjustment and readjustment, (B) the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred
Stock at the time in effect, and (C) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if
any, of other property which at the time would be received upon the conversion of a share of
Preferred Stock.

(m) Notices of Record Date. In the event of: (i) any taking by the
Corporation of a record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining
the holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend) or other
distribution, any right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of stock of any
class or any other securities or property, or to receive any other right; (ii) any amendment of this
Certificate of Incorporation; or (iii) any event deemed a liquidation pursuant to Section IV(B)(2)
of this Certificate of Incorporation, the Corporation shall mail to each stockholder who, together
with its affiliates, holds at least 500,000 shares of Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any stock
dividends, combinations or splits with respect to such shares), at least ten (10) days prior to the
date specified therein, a notice specifying the date on which any such record of holders or action
is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution, right, liquidation or amendment,
and, if applicable, the amount and/or character of such dividend, distribution, right, liquidation or
amendment.

(n) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation
shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common

Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock,
such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, in addition to such other remedies as shall be
available to the holder of such Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate action as
may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of

GDSVF&I860384.4 -15-
Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including,
without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any
necessary amendment to this Certificate of Incorporation.

(0) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Article
IV(B)(3) to be given to the holders of shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed given if
deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to each holder of record at
his address appearing on the books of the Corporation.

4. Redemption. The Preferred Stock is not redeemable.

5. Voting Rights.

(a) Except with respect to the election of directors (which shall be
governed by subsection (b) below) and as otherwise provided herein or as required by law, the
holder of each share of Preferred Stock shall have the right to one vote for each share of
Common Stock into which such Preferred Stock could then be converted, and with respect to
such vote, such holder shall have full voting rights and powers equal to the voting rights and
powers of the holders of Common Stock, and shall be entitled, notwithstanding any provision
hereof, to notice of any stockholders’ meeting in accordance with the Bylaws of the Corporation,
and shall be entitled to vote, together with holders of Common Stock, as a single class, except as
required by law or these articles, with respect to any question upon which holders of Common
Stock have the right to vote. Fractional votes shall not, however, be permitted and any fractional
voting rights available on an as-converted basis (after aggregating all shares into which shares of
Preferred Stock held by each holder could be converted) shall be rounded to the nearest whole
number (with one-half being rounded upward).

(b) As long as at least 1,000,000 shares of Series 2 Preferred remain
outstanding, the holders of the Series 2 Preferred, voting separately as a class, shall have the right
to elect, remove and replace three (3) members of the Board of Directors. The holders of
Common Stock, voting together as a single class, shall have the right to elect, remove and replace
two (2) members of the Board of Directors. The holders of Preferred Stock and Common Stock,
voting together as a single class on an as converted basis, shall have the right to elect, remove
and replace the remaining members of the Board of Directors.

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 223(a)(1) and 223(a)(2)
of the General Corporation Law, any vacancy, including newly created directorships resulting
from any increase in the authorized number of directors or amendment of this Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, and vacancies created by removal or resignation of a director, may
be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, though less than a quorum, or by a sole
remaining director, and the directors so chosen shall hold office until the next annual election and
until their successors are duly elected and shall! qualify, unless sooner displaced; provided,
however, that where such vacancy occurs among the directors elected by the holders of a class or
series of stock, the holders of shares of such class or series may override the Board’s action to fill
such vacancy by (i) voting for their own designee to fill such vacancy at a meeting of the

GDSVF&HM1860384.4 -16-

Company’s stockholders or (ii) written consent, if the consenting stockholders hold a sufficient
number of shares to elect their designee at a meeting of the stockholders. Any director may be
removed during his or her term of office, either with or without cause, by, and only by, the
affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of the class or series of stock entitled to elect such
director or directors, given either at a special meeting of such stockholders duly called for that
purpose or pursuant to a written consent of stockholders, and any vacancy thereby created may be
filled by the holders of that class or series of stock represented at the meeting or pursuant to
written consent.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Certificate of Incorporation to the
contrary, any action that adversely affects the rights, preferences and privileges of any series of
Preferred Stock, but does not so affect the entire class of Preferred Stock, shall require the
consent of the holders of a majority of such affected series of Preferred Stock (voting together as
a single class on an as-converted basis).

6. Protective Provisions.

(a) So long as at least 2,250,000 shares of Series 2 Preferred are
outstanding, the Corporation shall not (by merger, consolidation or otherwise) without first
obtaining the approval (by vote or written consent, as provided by law) of the holders of a
majority of the then outstanding shares of Series 2 Preferred:

(i) alter, change or amend the rights, preferences or privileges
of the Preferred Stock;

(ii) authorize or designate, whether by reclassification or
otherwise, any new class or series of stock or any other securities convertible into equity
securities of the Company ranking on a parity with or senior to any series of Preferred Stock in
right of redemption, liquidation preference, voting or dividend rights;

(iii) | consummate a transaction that is deemed a liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation pursuant to Article IV(B)(2)(e);

(iv) amend or waive any provision of the Corporation’s
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws;

(v) increase or decrease the authorized number of directors
constituting the Board of Directors;

(vi) redeem, repurchase or declare any dividend on any capital
stock of the Company; provided, however, that this restriction shall not apply to the repurchase
of shares of Common Stock from employees, directors, officers or consultants pursuant to
agreements under which the Corporation has the option to repurchase such shares at cost upon
the occurrence of certain events, such as the termination of employment or service; or

GDSVF&M1860384.4 -17-
(vii) pay dividends to holders of Preferred Stock or Common
Stock.

7. Status of Converted Stock. If any shares of Preferred Stock shall be
converted pursuant to Article IV(B)(3) hereof, the shares so converted shall be canceled and shall
not be issuable by the Corporation. The Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation shall be
appropriately amended to effect the corresponding reduction in the Corporation’s authorized
capital stock.

(C) Common Stock.

1. Dividend Rights. Subject to the prior rights of holders of all classes of
stock at the time outstanding having prior rights as to dividends, the holders of the Common
Stock shall be entitled to receive, when, if and as declared by the Board of Directors, out of any
assets of the Corporation legally available therefor, such dividends as may be declared from time
to time by the Board of Directors.

2. Liquidation Rights, Upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation the assets of this corporation shall be distributed as provided in Article IV(B)(2).

3. Redemption. The Common Stock is not redeemable at the option of the
holder.

4, Voting Rights. Subject to Article 'V(B)(5), the holder of each share of
Common Stock shall have the right to one vote, and shall be entitled to notice of any
stockholders’ meeting in accordance with the Bylaws of the Corporation, and shall be entitled to
vote upon such matters and in such manner as may be provided by law.

5. Adjustment in Authorized Common Stock, The number of authorized
shares of Common Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares of
Common Stock then outstanding) by an affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding stock of the Corporation, voting together as a single class, irrespective of the
provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.

ARTICLE V

made or threatened to be made a party to an action or proceeding, whether criminal, civil,
administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he, his testator or intestate is or was a
director or officer of the Corporation or any predecessor of the Corporation, or serves or served at
any other enterprise as a director or officer at the request of the Corporation or any predecessor to
the Corporation.

(C) Neither any amendment nor repeal of this Article VI, nor the adoption of any
provision of the Corporation’s Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this Article VII,
shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article VII in respect of any matter occurring, or any
action or proceeding accruing or arising or that, but for this Article VI, would accrue or arise,
prior to such amendment, repeal or adoption of an inconsistent provision.

ARTICLE VIII

In the event that any member of the Corporation’s Board of Directors who is not an
employee of the Corporation, including any member of the Board of Directors who is also a
partner or employee of an entity that is a holder of Preferred Stock (or Common Stock issued
upon conversion thereof) and that is in the business of investing and reinvesting in other entities,
or an employee of an entity that manages such an entity (each, a “Fund”), acquires knowledge of
a potential transaction or other matter other than directly in connection with such individual’s
service as a member of the Board of Directors (including, if applicable, in such individual’s
capacity as a partner or employee of the Fund or the manager or general partner of a Fund) that
may be an opportunity of interest for both the Corporation and such individual or Fund (a
“Corporate Opportunity”), then, provided, that such director has acted in good faith, the
Corporation: (i) renounces any interest or expectancy that such director or Fund offer an
opportunity to participate in such Corporate Opportunity to the Corporation, and (ii) to the fullest
extent permitted by law, waives any claim that such opportunity constituted a Corporate
Opportunity that should have been presented by such director or Fund to the Corporation or any
of its affiliates.
