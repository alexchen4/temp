ARGOS THERAPEUTICS, INC.

Pursuant to Section 242 of the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware

Argos Therapeutics, Inc. (the “Corporation”’), a corporation organized and existing under and by virtue of the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, does hereby certify as follows:

A resolution was duly adopted by the Board of Directors of the Corporation pursuant to Section 242 of the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware setting forth a proposed amendment to the Third Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, as amended (the “Restated Certificate of Corporation”) and
declaring such amendment to be advisable. The stockholders of the Corporation duly approved and adopted such
proposed amendment by written consent in accordance with Sections 228 and 242 of the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware. Accordingly, to effect such proposed amendment, it is:

RESOLVED:

That Section 4.1 of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, as amended, be
and hereby is deleted in its entirety and the following is inserted in lieu thereof:

“4.1 Upon the filing of this Certificate of Amendment of Restated Certificate of
Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the “Effective Time’), a one-
for-22.6272 reverse stock split of the Corporation’s Common Stock shall become effective,
pursuant to which each 22.6272 shares of Common Stock outstanding and held of record by each
stockholder of the Corporation (including treasury shares) immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be reclassified and combined into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
Common Stock automatically and without any action by the holder thereof upon the Effective
Time and shall represent one share of Common Stock from and after the Effective Time (such
reclassification and combination of shares designated as the “Reverse Stock Split”). No fractional
shares of Common Stock shall be issued as a result of the Reverse Stock Split and, in lieu thereof,
upon surrender after the Effective Time of a certificate which formerly represented shares of
Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, any
person who

would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of Common Stock as a result of the Reverse Stock
Split, following the Effective Time, shall be entitled to receive a cash payment equal to the fraction
of which such holder would otherwise be entitled multiplied by the fair value per share as
determined by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

Each stock certificate that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented shares of
Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
from and after the Effective Time, automatically and without the necessity of presenting the same
for exchange, represent that number of whole shares of Common Stock after the Effective Time
into which the shares formerly represented by such certificate have been reclassified (as well as the
right to receive cash in lieu of fractional shares of Common Stock after the Effective Time);
provided, however, that each person of record holding a certificate that represented shares of
Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
receive, upon surrender of such certificate, a new certificate evidencing and representing the
number of whole shares of Common Stock after the Effective Time into which the shares of
Common Stock formerly represented by such certificate shall have been reclassified; provided,
further, however that if any holder of record holds more than one stock certificate representing
RESOLVED:

RESOLVED:

RESOLVED:

shares of Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, then all of the shares of Common Stock held of record by such holder shall be aggregated
immediately prior to the Effective Time with such aggregate amount subject to the Reverse Stock
Split and such holder shall receive, upon surrender of all such certificates, a single new certificate
evidencing and representing the number of whole shares of Common Stock after the Effective
Time into which all of the shares of Common Stock formerly represented by the certificates held
by such holder shall have been reclassified.

The total number of shares of all classes of stock which the Corporation shall have the
authority to issue is 457,259,867, of which (i) 262,870,000 shares are of a class designated
“Common Stock”, $0.001 par value (the “Common” ), and (ii) 194,389,867 shares are of a class
designated “Preferred Stock”, $0.001 par value (the “Preferred”), of which 1,648,253 shares are
of a series of such class designated “Series A Preferred Stock” (the “Series A Preferred”),
29,799,083 shares are of a series of such class designated “Series B Preferred Stock” (the “Series
B Preferred”’), 3,671,086 shares are of a series of such class designated “Series B-1 Preferred
Stock” (the “Series B-1 Preferred”), and 159,271,445 shares are of a series of such class
designated “Series C Preferred Stock” (the “Series C Preferred”).”

“Qualified Public Offering” means the closing of a firm commitment underwritten public
offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, covering
the offer and sale of Common for the account of the Company to the public where such offering is

adjusted for stock splits, dividends and the like) with aggregate proceeds to the Company of not
less than $30,000,000 (before deduction of underwriters commissions and expenses) or (b) (i) at a
price per share satisfactory to the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof, (ii)
effective on or before March 31, 2012, and (iii) with aggregate proceeds to the Company of not

Purchase Price (as defined below).”
