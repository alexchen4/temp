(or consideration) to be distributed to the holders of the Preferred Stock shall be
insufficient to permit the payment to all such stockholders of the full preferential
amounts aforesaid, then all of the assets of the Company shall be distributed first
to the Series D Preferred on the basis of the full Series D Liquidation Price
payable with respect to such shares of Series D Preferred if such Series D
Liquidation Price was paid in full, then to the Series C Preferred on the basis of

Preferred if such Series C Liquidation Price was paid in full and then ratably to
the holders of the Series A Preferred and the Series B Preferred on the basis of the
full Series A/B Liquidation Price payable with respect to such shares of Series A
Preferred and the Series B Preferred if such Series A/B Liquidation Price was
paid in full.

Remaining Assets. If the assets of the Company available for distribution to the
Company’s stockholders after distribution of the Common Carve Out exceed the
aggregate amount payable to the holders of the Preferred Stock pursuant to
Section 4.5.1 hereof, then after the Common Carve-Out and the payments
required by Section 4.5.1 shall have been made or irrevocably set apart, such
remaining assets shall be distributed equally, on a per share fully diluted basis,
among the holders of the Common Stock and the Preferred Stock; provided,

13
4.5.3

however, that, subject to Section 4.5.3 below, (i) the holders of the Series D
Preferred shall in no event receive distributions (including the Series D
Liquidation Price) valued at more than three hundred percent (300%) of the Series
D Original Issue Price (adjusted for share combinations or subdivisions and other
recapitalizations of the Company’s shares); (ii) the holders of the Series C
Preferred shall in no event receive distributions (including the Series C
Liquidation Price) valued at more than three hundred percent (300%) of the Series
C Original Issue Price (adjusted for share combinations or subdivisions and other

Liquidation Price) valued at more than three hundred percent (300%) of the Series
B Original Issue Price (adjusted for share combinations or subdivisions and other
recapitalizations of the Company’s shares); and (iv) the holders of the Series A
Preferred shall in no event receive distributions (including the Series A/B
Liquidation Price} valued at more than three hundred percent (300%) of the Series
A Original Issue Price (adjusted for share combinations or subdivisions and other
recapitalizations of the Company’s shares).

As-Conyerted Liquidation Amount. Notwithstanding Sections 4.5.1 and 4.5.2,
in the event that the amount that would be payable to the holders of the Series D
Preferred, the Series C Preferred, the Series B Preferred and/or the Series A
Preferred had all such shares of the applicable series been converted into
Common Stock pursuant to Section 4.6 hereof immediately prior to such
Liquidation Event (such amount, the “As-Converted Liquidation Amount”)
exceeds the amount that would otherwise be payable to such holders pursuant to
Sections 4.5.1 and 4.5.2, then the holders of the Series D Preferred, the Series C
Preferred, the Series B Preferred and/or the Series A Preferred shal! be deemed to
have converted all shares of Preferred Stock of the applicable series into Common
Stock and shall receive, immediately prior to the closing of such Liquidation
Event, the As-Converted Liquidation Amount. For the purposes of determining
the As-Converted Liquidation Amount, in the event of a Liquidation Event in
connection with which fixed amounts are to be distributed to the stockholders of
the Company at the closing and additional contingent amounts (including, but not
limited to, earnout payments, escrow amounts or other contingent payments) may
be distributed to the stockholders of the Company after the closing (the date of
such closing and the date(s) upon which such additional contingent amounts are
paid are each hereinafter referred to as a “Payment Date”), each holder of
Preferred Stock shail be entitled to be paid, out of the funds and assets that legally
may be distributed to the stockholders of the Company on such Payment Date, an
amount for each share of each series of Preferred Stock held upon the closing of
such Liquidation Event equal to:

A. the greater of the amount of cash, securities and other property to which
such holder would have been entitled on a per share basis

(1) pursuant to Sections 4.5.1 and 4.5.2; or

14
4.5.4

4.5.5

(2) if all shares of such series of Preferred Stock had converted to
Common Stock pursuant to Section 4.6 immediately prior to the
closing of such Liquidation Event; reduced by:

B. the amount per share paid to such holder with respect to such holder’s
shares of such series of Preferred Stock on all prior Payment Dates.

The amounts calculated pursuant to this Section 4.5.3 shall be calculated:

(i) assuming, with respect to each other series of Preferred Stock, the
conversion into Common Stock of all shares of each other seties of
Preferred Stock that would receive a greater per share amount if converted
into Common Stock immediately prior to the closing of such Liquidation
Event than such shares would be entitled to if it remained as Preferred
Stock; and

(ii) after taking into account the operation of this Section 4,53 with
respect to all series of Preferred Stock and treating the distributions to the
stockholders of the Corporation made upon such Payment Date and all
prior Payment Dates as having been made simultaneously upon the closing
of the Liquidation Event, provided that any amounts held in escrow ot
subject to earnout payments or any other contingent payments on a
Payment Date shall not be treated as distributed to stockholders of the
Corporation until such amounts are actually paid to such stockholders.

Treatment of Escrows and Contingent Payments, In the case of an Acquisition
or Asset Transfer, if any portion of the consideration payable to the stockholders

of the Company is placed into escrow and/or is payable to the stockholders of the
Company subject to earnout payments or other contingent payments, (i) the
portion of such consideration that is not placed in escrow and is not subject to any
earnout payments or other contingent payments (the “Initial Consideration”) shall
be allocated among the holders of capital stock of the Company in accordance
with Sections 4.5.1 and 4.5.2 above (and 4.5.3 above if applicable), as if the
Initial Consideration were the only consideration payable in connection with such
Acquisition or Asset Transfer, and (ii) any additional consideration that becomes
payable to the stockholders of the Company upon release from escrow or payment
of earnout payments or other contingent payments shall be allocated among the
holders of capital stock of the Company in accordance with Sections 4.5.1 and
4.5.2 above (and 4.5.3 above if applicable), after taking into account the previous
payment of the Initial Consideration. For the avoidance of doubt, any
consideration that is placed in escrow or is subject to earn out payments or other
contingent payments on a specific Payment Date shall not be included in the
determination or calculation of the As-Converted Liquidation Amount on such
Payment Date.

Acquisition; Asset Transfer. Any Acquisition or Asset Transfer shall be
deemed to be a Liquidation Event within the meaning of Section 4.5.1.

15
4.5.6

45,7

Notice. Written notice of such Liquidation Event stating a payment date and the
place where said payments shall be made, shall be given by mail, postage prepaid,
or by telephone facsimile to non-U.S. residents, not less than 20 days prior to the
payment date stated therein, to the holders of record of Preferred Stock, such
notice to be addressed to each such holder at its address as shown by the records
of the Company.

Determination of Consideration. To the extent any distribution pursuant to
Section 4.5.1, Section 4.5.2 or Section 4.5.3 consists of property other than cash,
the value thereof shall, for purposes of Section 4.5.1, Section 4.5.2, or
Section 4.5.3 be the fair value at the time of such distributions as determined in
good faith by a majority of the members of the Board, which majority shall
include such number of the Preferred Directors whose designators under
Section 1.1.2 of the Voting Agreement, along with each such designator’s
Affiliates, hold in the aggregate a majority of the then outstanding shares of the
Preferred Stock, except that any publicly-traded securities to be distributed to
stockholders in a liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company shall be
valued as follows:

A. If the securities are then traded on a national securities exchange or the
Nasdaq Stock Market (or a similar national quotation system), then the
value of the securities shall be deemed to be to the average of the closing
prices of the securities on such exchange or system over the 30 trading day
period ending three trading days prior to the distribution;

B. if the securities are actively traded over-the-counter, then the value of the
securities shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid prices of the
securities over the 30 trading day period ending three trading days prior to
the distribution.

In the event of a merger or other acquisition of the Company by another
entity, the distribution date shall be deemed to be the date such transaction closes.

For the purposes of this Section 4.5 5, “trading day” shall mean any day
which the exchange or system on which the securities to be distributed are traded
is open and “closing prices” or “closing bid prices” shall be deemed to be: (i) for
securities traded primarily on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock
Exchange or Nasdaq Stock Market, the last reported trade price or sale price, as
the case may be, at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on that day and (ii) for securities
listed or traded on other exchanges, markets and systems, the market price as of
the end of the regular hours trading period that is generally accepted as such for
such exchange, market or system. If, after the date hereof, the benchmark times
generally accepted in the securities industry for determining the market price of a
stock as of a given trading day shall change from those set forth above, the fair
market value shall be determined as of such other generally accepted benchmark
times.

A,

fe

Each share of Series A Preferred shall be convertible, in whole or in part,

issuance, at the office of the Company or any transfer agent for the
Common Stock, into the number of shares of Common Stock determined
by dividing the Series A Original Issue Price by the Series A Conversion
Price. The conversion price for the Series A Preferred shal! be initially

by dividing the Series B Original Issue Price by the Series B Conversion
Price. The conversion price for the Series B Preferred shall be initially
$2.5683 per share (the “Series B Conversion Price”) and shall be subject
to adjustment, in order to adjust the number of shares of Common Stock
into which the Series B Preferred is convertible, as hereinafter provided.

Each share of Series C Preferred shall be convertible, in whole or in part,
without the payment of any additional consideration by the holder thereof
and at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of origina!
issuance, at the office of the Company or any transfer agent for the
Common Stock, into the number of shares of Common Stock determined
by dividing the Series C Original Issue Price by the Series C Conversion
Price. The conversion price for the Series C Preferred shall be initially
$2.30 per share (the “Series C Conversion Price”) and shall be subject to

4.6,2

4.6.3

4.6.4

adjustment, in order to adjust the number of shares of Common Stock into
which the Series D Preferred is convertible, as hereinafter provided.

Automatic Conversion. If at any time (a) the Company shall complete a
Qualified Public Offering or (b) the holders of (1) a majority of the then
outstanding Preferred Stock, and (2) a majority of the then outstanding Series D
Preferred, shall consent in writing to the conversion of the Preferred Stock into
shares of Common Stock, then effective upon (i) the closing of the sale of such
shares by the Company pursuant to such Qualified Public Offering or (ii) such
vote of the holders of the Preferred Stock, as the case may be, all outstanding
shares of the Preferred Stock shall automatically convert into shares of Common
Stock at the applicable Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock.

Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shail be issued upon
conversion of the Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional share to which any
holder would otherwise be entitled upon conversion of some or all of the
Preferred Stock owned by such holder, the Company shal! pay cash equal to such
fraction multiplied by the then effective Series A Conversion Price, Series B
Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price or Series D Conversion Price, as
applicable, or round up to the nearest whole share.

Mechanics of Optional Conversion. Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall
be entitled to convert the same into full shares of Common Stock, such holder
shall surrendet the certificate or certificates therefor, endorsed or accompanied by
written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Company,
duly executed by the registered holder or by such holder’s attorney duly
authorized in writing, at the office of the Company or of any transfer agent for the
Common Stock, and shall give written notice to the Company at such office that
such holder elects to convert the same and shall state therein such holder’s name
or the name of the nominees in which such holder wishes the certificate or
certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued, The Company shall, as
soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of
Preferred Stock, or to such holder’s nominee or nominees, a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall!
be entitled as aforesaid, together with cash in lieu of any fraction of a share. Such
conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of
business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be
converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record
holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date. From and after
such date, all rights of the holder with respect to the Preferred Stock so converted
shall terminate, except only the right of such holder, upon the surrender of his, her
or its certificate or certificates therefor, to receive certificates for the number of
shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof, certificates for the
number of shares of Preferred Stock remaining and cash for fractional shares.

18
4.6.5 Mechanics of Automatic Conversion. All holders of record of shares of

4.6.6

Preferred Stock will be given at least three days’ written or telephonic notice of
the anticipated date of any automatic conversion date referenced in Section 4.6 2.
Each such notice shall designate a place for automatic conversion of all of the
shares of such Preferred Stock. Such notices will be sent by mail, first class,
postage prepaid to each record holder of Preferred Stock at such holder’s address
appearing on the Company’s stock register, or by overnight courier service in the
case of the notice prior to the actual date of conversion. On or before the date
fixed for conversion, each holder of shares of Preferred Stock shall surrender such
holder’s certificate or certificates for all such shares to the Company at the place
designated in such notice, and shall thereafter receive certificates for the number
of shares of Common Stock or other securities to which such holder is entitled.
Failure to provide such notice shall not affect the validity of automatic conversion
hereunder. On the date fixed for conversion, all rights with respect to the
Preferred Stock will terminate, except only (i) any rights to receive declared but
unpaid dividends with a record date preceding the date of conversion, and (ii) the
tights of the holders thereof, upon surrender of their certificate or certificates
therefor, to receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock or
other securities into which such Preferred Stock has been converted and cash for
fractional shares. If so required by the Company, certificates surrendered for
conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or
instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Company, duly executed by the
registered holder or by her, his or its attorney duly authorized in writing. All
certificates evidencing shares of Preferred Stock which are required to be
surrendered for conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof shall, from
and after the date such certificates are so required to be surrendered, be deemed to
have been retired and canceled and the shares of Preferred Stock represented
thereby converted into Common Stock for all purposes, notwithstanding the
failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender such certificates on or prior to
such date; provided that the Company may require the holder to provide adequate
protection to the Company for the loss of such certificate(s) prior to issuing
certificates for shares of Common Stock to such holder. As soon as practicable
after the date of such automatic conversion and the surrender of the certificate or
certificates for Preferred Stock as aforesaid, the Company shal! cause to be issued
and delivered to such holder, or to her, his or its written order, a certificate or
certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock or other securities
issuable on such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof and cash as
provided in Section 4.6.3 in respect of any fraction of a share of Common Stock
otherwise issuable upon such conversion.

distribution, be proportionately adjusted.

reclassification, reorganization or exchange (other than described in

Section 4.6.6(A) above) or any merger, acquisition, consolidation or
reorganization of the Company with another company or entity (other than
an Acquisition or Asset Transfer), each share of Preferred Stock shall
thereafter be convertible into the number of shares of stock or other
securities or property to which a holder of the number of shares of
Common Stock of the Company deliverable upon conversion of the
Preferred Stock would have been entitled upon such reclassification,
reorganization, exchange, consolidation, merger or conveyance had the
conversion occurred immediately prior to the event; and, in any such case,
appropriate adjustment (as determined by the Board) shall be made in the
application of the provisions herein set forth with respect to the rights and
interests thereafter of the holders of the Preferred Stock, to the end that the
provisions set forth herein (including provisions with respect to changes in
and other adjustments of the applicable Series A Conversion Price, Series
B Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price, and Series D Conversion
Price) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in
relation to any shares of stock or other property thereafter deliverable
upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock.

of this Restated Certificate, makes, or fixes a record date for the
determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend
or other distribution payable in securities of the Company other than
shares of Common Stock, then and in each such event (unless the holders
of Preferred Stock receive a comparable dividend or distribution under
Section 4.4.1), provision shall be made so that the holders of Preferred
Stock shall receive upon conversion thereof, in addition to the number of
shares of Common Stock receivable thereupon, the amount of securities of
the Company which they would have received had their Preferred Stock
been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event and had they

20
4.6.7

thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to and including
the conversion date, retained such securities receivable by them as
aforesaid during such period, subject to all other adjustments called for
during such period under this Section 4.6.6 with respect to the rights or the
holders of the Preferred Stock.

Adjustment to Conversion Price for Issue or Sale of Additional Shares of
Common Stock. If, at any time or fiom time to time on or after the filing of this

Restated Certificate, the Company shall issue or sell Additional Shares of
Common Stock for an Effective Price per share less than the Series A Conversion

D Conversion Price, as applicable, then in effect or for no consideration, then the
then applicable Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series C
Conversion Price or Series D Conversion Price, as applicable, shall be reduced to
an adjusted conversion price (computed to the nearest cent, a half cent being
treated as a full cent), as of the date of such issue or sale, by dividing (A) the sum
of (i) the result obtained by multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale by the Series A Conversion
Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price or Series D
Conversion Price, as applicable, then in effect, and (ii) the consideration, if any,
received by the Company upon such issue and sale, by (B) the number of shares
of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such issue or sale. For purposes
of adjusting the Series A Conversion Price, the Series B Conversion Price, the
Series C Conversion Price or the Series D Conversion Price under this
Section 4.6.7, Common Stock outstanding shall include all outstanding shares of
Common Stock and those shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise or
conversion of all outstanding convertible securities (including the Preferred
Stock), and options and warrants that are exercisable (directly or indirectly) into
Common Stock.

4.6.8 Further Provisions for Adjustment of Conversion Price. For the purpose of

Section 4.6.8 above, the following provisions shall be applicable:

A. Issuance Provisions for Adjustment of Conversion Price. If, at any
time on or after the filing of this Restated Certificate, the Company shall
issue or sell any Convertible Securities, there shall be determined as of the
date of issue the Effective Price per share for which Additional Shares of
Common Stock are issuable upon the conversion or exchange thereof,
such determination to be made by dividing (i) the total amount received or
receivable by the Company as consideration for the issue or sale of such
Convertible Securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional
consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon the conversion or
exchange thereof, by (ii) the maximum number of Additional Shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exchange of all of such
Convertible Securities; and such issue or sale shall be deemed to be an
issue or sale for cash (as of the date of issue or sale of such Convertible

2]
Securities) of such maximum number of Additional Shares of Common
Stock at the price per share so determined,

If such Convertible Securities shall by their terms provide for an increase
or increases, with the passage of time, in the amount of additional
consideration, if any, payable to the Company, or in the rate of exchange,
upon the conversion or exchange thereof the adjusted Series A Conversion
Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price or Series D
Conversion Price shail, forthwith upon any such increase becoming
effective, be readjusted (but to no extent greater than originally adjusted)
to reflect the same.

If any rights of conversion or exchange evidenced by such Convertible
Securities shall expire without having been exercised, any adjusted Series
A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price
or Series D Conversion Price shall forthwith be readjusted to be the
adjusted Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series C
Conversion Price or Series D Conversion Price which would have been in
effect had an adjustment been made on the basis that the only Additional
Shares of Common Stock issued or sold were those actually issued upon
the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, and that they
were issued or sold for the consideration actually received by the
Company upon such conversion or exchange, plus the consideration, if
any, actually received by the Company for the issue or sale of such
Convertible Securities as were actually converted or exchanged.

Grant of Rights, Warrants or Options for Common Stock. If, at any
time on or after the filing of this Restated Certificate, the Company shall

grant any rights, warrants or options to subscribe for, purchase or
otherwise acquire Additional Shares of Common Stock, there shall be
determined as of the date of issue the Effective Price per share for which
Additional Shares of Common Stock are issuable upon the exercise of
such rights warrants or options, such determination to be made by dividing
{i} the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Company as
consideration for the granting of such rights or options, plus the minimum
aggregate amount of additional consideration payable to the Company
upon the exercise of such rights or options, by (ii) the maximum number
of Additional Shares of Common Stock of the Company issuable upon the
exercise of such rights or options; and the granting of such rights, warrants
or options shall be deemed to be an issue or sale for cash (as of the date of
the granting of such rights, warrants or options) of such maximum number
of Additional Shares of Common Stock at the price per share so
determined.

If such rights, warrants or options shall by their terms provide for an

increase or increases, with the passage of time, in the amount of additional
consideration payable to the Company upon the exercise thereof, the

22
Cc,

adjusted Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series C
Conversion Price or Series D Conversion Price shall, forthwith upon any
such increase becoming effective, be readjusted to reflect the same (but to
no extent greater than originally adjusted).

If any such rights, warrants or options shall expire without having been
exercised, any adjusted Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion
Price, Series C Conversion Price or Series D Conversion Price shall
forthwith be readjusted to be the adjusted Series A Conversion Price,
Series B Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price ot Series D
Conversion Price which would have been in effect had an adjustment been
made on the basis that the only Additional Shares of Common Stock so
issued or sold were those actually issued or sold upon the exercise of such
rights, warrants or options and that they were issued or sold for the
consideration actually received by the Company upon such exercise, plus
the consideration, if any, actually received by the Company for the
granting of all such rights, warrants or options, whether or not exercised.

otherwise acquire Convertible Securities, there shall be determined as of
the date of issue the Effective Price per share for which Additional Shares
of Common Stock are issuable upon the exercise of such rights warrants or
options for such Convertible Securities, such determination to be made by
dividing (i) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the
Company as consideration for the granting of such rights, warrants or
options, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration
payable to the Company upon the exercise of such rights, warrants or
options, by (ii} the maximum number of Additional Shares of Common
Stock of the Company issuable upon the exercise of such rights, warrants
or options and the conversion or exchange of all of such Convertible
Securities; and the granting of such rights, warrants or options shall be
deemed to be an issue or sale for cash (as of the date of the granting of
such rights, warrants or options) of such maximum number of Additional
Shares of Common Stock at the price per share so determined.

If such rights, warrants or options shall by their terms provide for an
increase or increases, with the passage of time, in the amount of additional
consideration payable by the Company upon the exercise thereof, any
adjusted Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series C
Conversion Price or Series D Conversion Price shall, forthwith upon any
such increase becoming effective, be readjusted to reflect the same (but to
no extent greater than originally adjusted).

If any such rights, warrants or options shall expire without having been
exercised, the adjusted Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion

23
Price, Series C Conversion Price or Series D Conversion Price shall
forthwith be readjusted to be the adjusted Series A Conversion Price,
Series B Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price or Series D
Conversion Price which would have been in effect had an adjustment been
made on the basis that the only Convertible Securities so issued or sold
were those actually issued or sold upon the exercise of such rights,
wattants or options and that they were issued or sold for the consideration
actually received by the Company upon such exercise plus the
consideration, if any, actually received by the Company for the granting of
all such rights, warrants or options, whether or not exercised.

consideration other than cash, or a consideration part of which is other
than cash, of any Additional Shares of Common Stock or Convertible
Securities or any rights, warrants o1 options to subscribe for, purchase or
otherwise acquire any Additional Shares of Common Stock or Convertible
Securities, the amount of the consideration other than cash received by the
Company shall be deemed to be the fair value of such consideration as
determined in good faith by the Board. In case any Additional Shares of
Common Stock or Convertible Securities or any rights, warrants or
options to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any Additional
Shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities shall be issued or sold
together with other stock or securities or other assets of the Company for a
consideration which covers two or more thereof, the consideration for the
issue or sale of such Additional Shares of Common Stock or Convertible
Securities or such rights, warrants or options shall be deemed to be the
portion of such consideration allocated thereto in good faith by the Board.

Duration of Adjusted Conversion Price. Following each computation or
readjustment of an adjusted Series A Conversion Price, Series B
Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price or Series D Conversion Price
as provided above in this Section 4.6, the new adjusted Series A
Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price
or Series D Conversion Price shall remain in effect until a further
