C:\Documents and Settings\rlepore\Local Settiings\Temporary Internet Files\Series C_ Certificate of Incorporation (Aquest)_(PALIB2_368102t_4).DOC -2-
payable in preference and priority to any declaration or payment of any Distribution on the Series A

California Corporations Code, if Section 502 or Section 503 of the California Corporations Code is
applicable to a payment made by the Corporation then such applicable section or sections shall not
apply if such payment is a payment made by the Corporation in connection with (i) repurchases of
Common Stock issued to or held by employees, officers, directors or consultants of the Corporation
or its subsidiaries upon termination of their employment or services pursuant to agreements
providing for the right of said repurchase, (ii) repurchases of Common Stock issued to or held by

3. Liquidation Rights.

(a) Liquidation Preference. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up
of the Corporation, either voluntary or involuntary, the holders of the Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any Distribution of any of the assets of the Corporation
to the holders of the Common Stock by reason of their ownership of such stock, an amount per share
for each share of Preferred Stock held by them equal to the sum of (i) the Liquidation Preference
specified for such share of Preferred Stock and (ii) all declared but unpaid dividends (if any) on such
share of Preferred Stock. If upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the
assets of the Corporation legally available for distribution to the holders of the Preferred Stock are .
insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full amounts specified in this Section 3(a),

CADocuments and Settings\rlepore\Local Settings\Temporary Intemet Files\Series C_ Certificate of Incorporation (Aquest)_(PALIB2_3681021_4).DOC -3-
then the entire assets of the Corporation legally available for distribution shall be distributed with
equal priority and pro rata among the holders of the Preferred Stock in proportion to the full amounts
they would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 3(a).

(b) Remaining Assets. After the payment to the holders of Preferred Stock of the
full preferential amounts specified in Section 3(a) above, the entire remaining assets of the
Corporation legally available for distribution by the Corporation shall be distributed with equal
priority and pro rata among the holders of the Preferred Stock and Common Stock in proportion to
the number of shares of Common Stock held by them, with the shares of Preferred Stock being
treated for this purpose as if they had been converted to shares of Common Stock at the then
applicable Conversion Rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the aggregate distributions made
pursuant to one or more subsections of this Section 3 with respect to any share of Preferred Stock
shall not exceed an amount equal to three (3) times the applicable Liquidation Preference for that
- share of Preferred Stock, plus any declared but unpaid dividends.

(c) Reorganization. For purposes of this Section 3, a liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation shall be deemed to be occasioned by, or to include, (a) the acquisition
of the Corporation by another entity by means of any transaction or series of related transactions to
which the Corporation is party (including, without limitation, any stock acquisition, reorganization,
‘Merger or consolidation but excluding any sale of stock for capital raising purposes) other than a
transaction or series of transactions in which the holders of the voting securities of the Corporation
outstanding immediately prior to such transaction continue to retain (either by such voting securities
remaining outstanding or by such voting securities being converted into voting securities of the
surviving entity), as a result of shares in the Corporation held by such holders prior-to‘such
transaction, at least fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power represented by the voting securities
of the Corporation or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such transaction or series
of transactions; (b) a sale, lease or other conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Corporation; or (c) any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, whether voluntary
or involuntary.

(d) Valuation of Non-Cash Consideration. If any assets of the Corporation
distributed to stockholders in connection with any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the
Corporation are other than cash, then the value of such assets shall be their fair market value as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, except that any publicly traded securities to be
distributed to stockholders in a liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation shall be
valued as follows:

(i) If the securities are then traded on a national securities exchange or the
Nasdaq Stock Market (or a similar national quotation system), then the value of the securities shall
_ be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange or system over
» the ten (10) trading day period ending five (5) trading days prior to the Distribution;

Gi) _if the securities are actively traded over-the-counter, then the value of

the securities shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid prices of the securities over the ten
. (10) trading day period ending five (5) trading days prior to the Distribution.

_ CADocuments and Settings\rlepore\Local Settings\Temporary Intemet Files\Series C_ Certificate of Incorporation (Aquest)_(PALIB2_3681021_4),DOC -4-
In the event of a merger or other acquisition of the Corporation by another entity, the
Distribution date shail be deemed to be the date such transaction closes.

For the purposes of this subsection 3(d), ‘trading day” shall mean any day which the
exchange or system on which the securities to be distributed are traded is open and “closing prices”
or “closing bid prices” shall be deemed to be: (i) for securities traded primarily on the New York
Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, the last reported trade price or sale price,
as the case may be, at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on that day and (ii) for securities listed or traded on
other exchanges, markets and systems, the market price as of the end of the regular hours trading
period that is generally accepted as such for such exchange, market or system. If, after the date
hereof, the benchmark times generally accepted in the securities industry for determining the market
price of a stock as of a given trading day shall change from those set forth above, the fair market
value shall be determined as of such other generally accepted benchmark times.

(e) Earnout Election. Notwithstanding Sections 3(a) and (b) above, solely for
purposes of determining the amount each holder of shares of a series of Preferred Stock is entitled to
receive with respect to a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation (as defined in
Section 3(c) above) (an “Acquisition”), at the closing of any Acquisition with respect to which
amounts are to be legally distributed to the Corporation’s stockholders and at each date after such
closing on which earnout payments (i.e., payments tied to the post-closing performance of the
Corporation’s business, and specifically not referring to the release of escrowed consideration with
respect to indemnification provisions relating to the Acquisition) are to be legally distributed to the
Corporation’s stockholders as a result of such Acquisition (each, a “Payment Date”; with all funds
to be released to the Corporation’s stockholders on the closing date referred to as “Closing Date
Consideration” and all earnout consideration actually paid to the Corporation’s stockholders
referred to as “Earnout Consideration”), each holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to be paid,
out of the cash, securities or other property, on such Payment Date an amount for each share of a
series of Preferred Stock held upon the closing of such Acquisition equal to: (a) the greater of the
amount of cash, securities and other property to which such holder would have been entitled (after
taking into account the operation of this Section 3(e) with respect to all series of Preferred Stock and
treating the distributions of the Closing Date Consideration and the Earnout Consideration, in the
aggregate, to the Corporation's stockholders made upon such Payment Date and all prior Payment
Dates as having been made simultaneously upon the closing of the Acquisition): (i) pursuant to
Sections 3(a) and (b) above or (ii) if all shares of such series of Preferred Stock had converted to
Common Stock pursuant to this Section 3 as of immediately prior to the closing of such Acquisition;
reduced by (b) the amount per share paid in the aggregate in Closing Date Consideration and
Earnout Consideration to such holder with respect to such holder’s Preferred Stock on all prior
Payment Dates; provided, however, that the fair market value of any non-cash consideration that
may be distributed to the Corporation’s stockholders on each Payment Date shall be determined in
accordance with the definitive agreement for the Acquisition. For purposes hereof, all amounts set
aside into escrow in connection with the Acquisition (other than amounts set aside into escrow solely
to fund future earnout payments) shall! be treated as having been released to the Corporation’s
stockholders on the closing date (i.e., shall be included in the calculation of “Closing Date
Consideration’), regardless of whether such consideration is actually ultimately released to the
Corporation’s stockholders.

C:\Documents and Settings\rlepore\Local Settings\Temporary Intemet Files\Series C_ Certificate of Incorporation (Aquest)_(PALIB2_3681021_4).DOC -5-
4. Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as
follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option
of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share at the office of the
Corporation or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, into that number of fully-paid,
nonassessable shares of Common Stock determined by dividing the Original Issue Price for the
relevant series by the Conversion Price for such series. (The number of shares of Common Stock
into which each share of Preferred Stock of a series may be converted is hereinafter referred to as the
“Conversion Rate” for each such series.) Upon any decrease or increase in the Conversion Price
for any series of Preferred Stock, as described in this Section 4, the Conversion Rate for such series
shall be appropriately increased or decreased.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into fully paid, non-
assessable shares of Common Stock at the then effective Conversion Rate for such share
(i) immediately prior to the closing of a firm commitment underwritten initial public offering
pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the “Securities Act’), covering the offer and sale of the Corporation’s Common Stock, provided
that the aggregate gross proceeds to the Corporation are not less than $40,000,000, or (ii) upon the
receipt by the Corporation of a written request for such conversion from the holders of at least two
thirds of the Preferred Stock then outstanding, or, if later, the effective date for conversion specified
in such requests (each of the events referred to in (i) and (ii) are referred to herein as an “Automatic
Conversion Event”).

(c) Mechanics of Conversion, No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued
upon conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would
otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the then
fair market value of a share of Common Stock as determined by the Board of Directors. For such
purpose, all shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder of Preferred Stock shall be aggregated,
and any resulting fractional share of Common Stock shall be paid in cash. Before any holder of
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into full shares of Common Stock, and to
receive certificates therefor, he shall either (A) surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly
endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock or
(B) notify the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or
destroyed and execute an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation
from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates, and shall give written notice to the
Corporation at such office that he elects to convert the same; provided, however, that on the date of
an Automatic Conversion Event, the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted
automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the
certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent;
provided further, however, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing
the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such Automatic Conversion Event unless either the
certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are delivered to the Corporation or its transfer
agent as provided above, or the holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such
certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the

CADocuments and Settings\rlepore\Local Seitings\Temporary Intemet Files\Series C__Cerlificate of Incorporation (Aquest)_(PALIB2_3681021_4).DOC -6-
Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such
certificates. On the date of the occurrence of an Automatic Conversion Event, each holder of record
of shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion, notwithstanding that the certificates representing such shares of
Preferred Stock shal] not have been surrendered at the office of the Corporation, that notice from the
Corporation shall not have been received by any holder of record of shares of Preferred Stock, or
that the certificates evidencing such shares of Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered to
such holder.

The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after such delivery, or after such agreement and
indemnification, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which he shall be entitled as aforesaid and
a check payable to the holder in the amount of any cash amounts payable as the result of a
conversion into fractional shares of Common Stock, plus any declared and unpaid dividends on the
converted Preferred Stock. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior
to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be
converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon
such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of
Common Stock on such date; provided, however, that if the conversion is in connection with an -
underwritten offer of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act or a merger, sale, financing,
or liquidation of the Corporation or other event, the conversion may, at the option of any holder _
tendering Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing of such transaction or —
upon the occurrence of such event, in which case the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion of the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such

Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such transaction or the occurrence of such
event.

(d} Adjustments to Conversion Price for Diluting Issues.

(i) Special Definition. For purposes of this paragraph 4(d), “Additional
Shares of Common” shall mean all shares of Common Stock issued (or, pursuant to paragraph. ~-
4(d)@ii), deemed to be issued) by the Corporation after the Original Issue Date, other than issuances
or deemed issuances of:

(1) Upto 1,700,000 (as adjusted for Recapitalizations, and net of
any stock repurchases or expired or terminated options pursuant to the terms of any option plan,
restricted stock purchase agreement or similar arrangement) shares of Common Stock, options, _
warrants or other rights to purchase Common Stock issued to employees, officers or directors of, or
consultants or advisors to, the Corporation or any subsidiary pursuant to restricted stock purchase _
agreements, stock option plans or similar arrangements, or such greater number as may be
unanimously approved by the Board of Directors;

(2) shares of Common Stock issued upon the exercise or
conversion of Options or Convertible Securities outstanding as of the date of the filing of this
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or upon the exercise or conversion of Options or
Convertible Securities counted against the limits set forth in sub-paragraph 4(d)(i)(1) above;

as

C:\Documents and Settings\rlepore\Local Settings\Temporary Internet Files\Series C__ Certificate of Incorporation {Aquest)_(PALIB2_3681021_4).DOC : -7T-.
(3) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable as a dividend or
distribution on Preferred Stock or pursuant to any event for which adjustment is made pursuant to
paragraph 4(e), 4(f) or 4(g) hereof;

(4) — shares of Common Stock issued in a registered public offering
under the Securities Act;

(5) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable pursuant to the
acquisition of another corporation by the Corporation by merger, purchase of substantially all of the
assets or other reorganization or to a joint venture agreement, provided that such issuances are
approved by the Board of Directors;

(6) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable to banks,
equipment lessors or other financial institutions pursuant to a debt financing or commercial leasing
transaction approved by the Board of Directors;

(7) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable in connection with
any settlement of any action, suit, proceeding or litigation approved by the Board of Directors;

(8) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable in connection with
sponsored research, collaboration, technology license, development, OEM, marketing or other
similar agreements or strategic partnerships approved by the Board of Directors; and

(9) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable to suppliers or third
party service providers in connection with the provision of goods-or services pursuant to transactions
approved by the Board of Directors.

(ii) No Adjustment of Conversion Price. No adjustment in the Conversion
Price of a particular series of Preferred Stock shall be made in respect of the issuance of Additional
Shares of Common unless the consideration per share (as determined pursuant to paragraph 4(d)(v))
for an Additional Share of Common issued or deemed to be issued by the Corporation is less than
the Conversion Price in effect on the date of, and immediately prior to such issue, for such series of
Preferred Stock.

(iii) Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall issue any Options or
Convertible Securities or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of
securities entitled to receive any such Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum number
of shares (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto without regard to any provisions contained
therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of
such Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities, the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities or, in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such
Options and the conversion or exchange of the underlying securities, shall be deemed to have been
issued as of the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shall have-been fixed, as of the close
of business on such record date, provided that in any such case in which shares are deemed to be
issued: :

C:\Documents and Settings\rlepore\Local Settings\Temporary Internet Files\Series C_ Certificate of Incorporation (Aquest)_(PALIB2_3681021_4),DOC -8-
(1) no further adjustment in the Conversion Price of any series of
Preferred Stock shall be made upon the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities or shares of
Common Stock in connection with the exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities;

(2) if such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms
provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any change in the consideration payable to the
Corporation or in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or
exchange thereof (other than a change pursuant to the anti-dilution provisions of such Options or
Convertible Securities such as this Section 4(d) or pursuant to Recapitalization provisions of such
Options or Convertible Securities such as Sections 4(e), 4(f) and 4(g) hereof), the Conversion Price
of each series of Preferred Stock and any subsequent adjustments based thereon shall be recomputed
to reflect such change as if such change had been in effect as of the original issue thereof (or upon
the occurrence of the record date with respect thereto);

(3) no readjustment pursuant to clause (2) above shall have the
effect of increasing the Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock to an amount above the
Conversion Price that would have resulted from any other issuances of Additional Shares of
Common and any other adjustments provided for herein between the original adjustment date and
such readjustment date;

(4) upon the expiration of any such Options or any rights of
conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have been exercised, the
- Conversion Price of each Series of Preferred-Stock computed upon the original issue thereof (or
upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto) and any subsequent adjustments based
thereon shall, upon such expiration, be recomputed as if:

(a) in the case of Convertible Securities or Options for
Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common issued were the shares of Common Stock, if
any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities and the consideration received therefor was the consideration actually
received by the Corporation for the issue of such exercised Options plus the consideration actually
received by the Corporation upon such exercise or for the issue of all such Convertible Securities
which were actually converted or exchanged, plus the additional consideration, if any, actually
received by the Corporation upon such conversion or exchange, and

(b) — inthe case of Options for Convertible Securities, only
the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were issued at the time of
issue of such Options, and the consideration received by the Corporation for the Additional Shares of
Common deemed to have been then issued was the consideration actually received by the
Corporation for the issue of such exercised Options, plus the consideration deemed to have been
received by the Corporation (determined pursuant to Section 4(d)(v)) upon the issue of the
Convertible Securities with respect to which such Options were actually exercised; and

(5) if such record date shall have been fixed and such Options or
Convertible Securities are not issued on the date fixed therefor, the adjustment previously made in

CN\Documents and Settings\rlepore\Local Settings\Temporary Internet Fites\Series Cc. Certificate of Incorporation (Aquest)_(PALIB2_3681021_4).DOC -9-
the Conversion Price which became effective on such record date shall be canceled as of the close of
business on such record date, and thereafter the Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this
paragraph 4(d)(iii) as of the actual date of their issuance.

(iv) Adjustment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional Shares
of Common. In the event this Corporation shall issue Additional Shares of Common (including
Additional Shares of Common deemed to be issued pursuant to paragraph 4(d)(iii)) without
consideration or for a consideration per share less than the applicable Conversion Price of a series of
Preferred Stock in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such issue, then, the Conversion
Price of the affected series of Preferred Stock shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a
price (calculated to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction,
the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to such issue plus the number of shares which the aggregate consideration received by the
Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of Common so issued would purchase at such
Conversion Price, and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of such Additional Shares of Common
so issued. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Conversion Price shall not be reduced at such time if
the amount of such reduction would be less than $0.01, but any such amount shall be carried
forward, and a reduction will be made with respect to such amount at the time of, and together with,
any subsequent reduction which, together with such amount and any other amounts so carried
forward, equal $0,01 or more in the aggregate. For the purposes of this Subsection 4(d)(iv), all
shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall —
be included as “common stock outstanding.” For the purposes of adjusting the Conversion Price of a
series of Preferred Stock, the grant, issue or sale of Additional Shares of Common consisting of the
same class of security and warrants to purchase such security issued or issuable at the same price at
two or more closings held within a six-month period shall be aggregated and shall be treated as one
sale of Additional Shares of Common occurring on the earliest date on which such securities were
granted, issued or sold.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this subsection 4(d),
the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue (or deemed issue) of any Additional
Shares of Common shall be computed as follows:

(i) Cash and Property. Such consideration shall:

(a) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
aggregate amount of cash received by the Corporation before deducting any reasonable discounts, _
commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the Corporation for any underwriting or
otherwise in connection with such issuance;

(b) _ insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair market value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors; and
