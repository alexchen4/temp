Subject to the prior dividend preference of the Series CC Preferred Stock, in each calendar year, the holders of the

each series of the Preferred Stock have been paid or

declared and set apart in any calendar year of the Company, the Board declares additional dividends out of funds
legally available therefor in that calendar year, then such additional dividends shall be declared pro rata on the
Common Stock.

2.3 Non-Cash Dividends. Whenever a dividend or Distribution provided for in this Section 2 shall be payable
in property other than cash, the value of such dividend or Distribution shall be deemed to be the fair market value of
such property as determined in good faith by the Board.

3. Liquidation Rights. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, whether
voluntary or involuntary, the funds and assets of the Company that may be legally distributed to the Company’s
shareholders (the “Available Funds and Assets”) shall be distributed to shareholders in the following manner:

3.1 Liquidation Preferences.

(a) Series CC Preferred Stock. The holders of each share of Series CC Preferred Stock then outstanding
shall be entitled to be paid, out of the Available Funds and Assets, and prior and in preference to any payment or
distribution (or any setting apart of any payment or distribution) of any Available Funds and Assets on any shares of
Series BB Preferred Stock, Series AA Preferred Stock or Common Stock, an amount per share equal to the Original
Issue Price for the Series CC Preferred Stock, plus all declared but unpaid dividends thereon. If upon any
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company the Available Funds and Assets shall be insufficient to permit
the payment to holders of the Series CC Preferred Stock of their full preferential amounts described in this
subsection, then all the remaining Available Funds and Assets shall be distributed among the holders of the then
outstanding Series CC Preferred Stock on a pro rata basis, according to the number of outstanding shares of
Series CC Preferred Stock then held by them.

(b) Series BB Preferred Stock. If there are any Available Funds and Assets remaining after the payment or
distribution (or the setting aside for payment or distribution) to the holders of the Series CC Preferred Stock of their
full preferential amount described above in subsection 3.1(a), then the holders of each share of Series BB Preferred
Stock then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid, out of the Available Funds and Assets, and prior and in
preference to any payment or distribution (or any setting apart of any payment or distribution) of any Available
Funds and Assets on any shares of Series AA Preferred Stock or Common Stock, an amount per share equal to the
Original Issue Price for the Series BB Preferred Stock, plus all declared but unpaid dividends thereon. If upon any
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company the Available Funds and Assets shall be insufficient to permit
the payment to holders of the Series BB Preferred Stock of their full preferential amounts described in this
subsection, then all the remaining Available Funds and Assets shall be distributed among the holders of the then
outstanding Series BB Preferred Stock on a pro rata basis, according to the number of outstanding shares of
Series BB Preferred Stock then held by them.

(c) Series AA Preferred Stock. If there are any Available Funds and Assets remaining after the payment or
distribution (or the setting aside for payment or

distribution) to the holders of the Series CC Preferred Stock and Series BB Preferred Stock of their full preferential
amounts described above in subsections 3.1(a) and 3.1(b), then the holders of each share of Series AA Preferred
Stock then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid, out of such remaining Available Funds and Assets, and prior and
in preference to any payment or distribution (or any setting apart of any payment or distribution) of any Available
Funds and Assets on any shares of Common Stock, an amount per share equal to the Original Issue Price for the
Series AA Preferred Stock, plus all declared but unpaid dividends thereon. If upon any liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Company the Available Funds and Assets shall be insufficient to permit the payment to holders of
the Series AA Preferred Stock of their full preferential amounts described in this subsection, then all the remaining
Available Funds and Assets shall be distributed among the holders of the then outstanding Series AA Preferred
Stock on a pro rata basis, according to the number of outstanding shares of Series AA Preferred Stock then held by
them.

3.2 No Participation Rights. If there are any Available Funds and Assets remaining after the payment or
distribution (or the setting aside for payment or distribution) to the holders of the Preferred Stock of their full
preferential amounts described above in subsections 3.1(a), 3.1(b) and 3.1(c), then all such remaining Available
Funds and Assets shall be distributed among the holders of the then outstanding Common Stock on a pro rata basis
according to the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock then held by each of them.

3.3 Merger or Sale of Assets. A (i) consolidation or merger of the Company with or into any other
corporation, corporations or other entity or person in which the holders of the Company’s outstanding shares
immediately before such consolidation or merger do not, immediately after such consolidation or merger, retain a
majority of the voting power of the surviving entity of such consolidation or merger on account of their
shareholdings in the Company immediately prior to such consolidation or merger (an “Acquisition”’); or (11) a sale,
lease or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company (an “Asset Transfer’), shall each be
deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company as those terms are used in this Section 3.

3.4 Deemed Conversion. Notwithstanding the above, for purposes of determining the amount each holder of
shares of Preferred Stock is entitled to receive with respect to an Acquisition, Asset Transfer or other liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Company, each such holder of shares of a series of Preferred Stock shall be deemed
to have converted (regardless of whether such holder actually converted) such holder’s shares of such series into
shares of Common Stock immediately prior to the Acquisition, Asset Transfer or other liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Company if, as a result of an actual conversion, such holder would receive, in the aggregate, an
amount greater than the amount that would be distributed to such holder if such holder did not convert such series of
Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock. If any such holder shall be deemed to have converted shares of
Preferred Stock into Common Stock pursuant to this paragraph, then such holder shall not be entitled to receive any
distribution that would otherwise be made to holders of Preferred Stock that have not converted (or have not been
deemed to have converted) into shares of Common Stock.

-5-
3.5 Non-Cash Consideration. If any assets of the Company distributed to shareholders in connection with any
liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company are other than cash, then the value of such assets shall be

their fair market value as determined by the Board, except that any securities to be distributed to shareholders in a
liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company shall be valued as follows:

(a) The method of valuation of securities not subject to investment letter or other similar restrictions on
free marketability shall be as follows:

(i) if the securities are then traded on a national securities exchange or the Nasdaq National Market (or a
similar national quotation system), then the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the
securities on such exchange or system over the 30-day period ending three (3) days prior to the distribution; and

(ii) if actively traded over-the-counter, then the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing
bid prices over the 30-day period ending three (3) days prior to the distribution; and

(iii) if there is no active public market, then the value shall be the fair market value thereof, as mutually
determined in good faith by the Board and the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock.

(b) The method of valuation of securities subject to investment letter or other restrictions on free
marketability shall be to make an appropriate discount from the market value determined as above in subparagraphs
(a)(i), (ii) or (iii) of this subsection to reflect the approximate fair market value thereof, as mutually determined in
good faith by the Board and the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock.

5. Conversion Rights. The outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be convertible into Common Stock as
follows:
5.1 Optional Conversion.

(a) At the option of the holder thereof, each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at any time or
from time to time, into fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as provided herein.

(b) Each holder of Preferred Stock who elects to convert the same into shares of Common Stock shall
surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Company or any transfer agent for
the Preferred Stock or Common Stock, and shall give written notice to the Company at such office that such holder
elects to convert the same and shall state therein the number of shares of Preferred Stock being converted.
Thereupon the Company shall promptly issue and deliver at such office to such holder a certificate or certificates for
the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled upon such conversion and pay any declared
and unpaid dividends on the shares being converted. Such conversion shall

-9-
be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the
certificate or certificates representing the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person entitled to
receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record
holder of such shares of Common Stock on such date.

5.2 Automatic Conversion.

(a) Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into fully paid and nonassessable shares
of Common Stock, as provided herein (i) immediately prior to the closing of a firm commitment underwritten public
offering pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, covering
the offer and sale of Common Stock for the account of the Company in which the aggregate public offering price
(before deduction of underwriters’ discounts and commissions) equals or exceeds Twenty Five Million Dollars
($25,000,000) and the public offering price per share of which equals or exceeds Four Dollars Eighty One and Eight
Tenths Cents ($4.818) per share before deduction of underwriters’ discounts and commissions (such price per share
of Common Stock to be appropriately adjusted to reflect Common Stock Events (as defined in subsection 5.4)); or
(ii) at any time upon the affirmative election of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock (determined on an as-converted-to-common basis as set forth in subsection 4.2).

(b) Upon the occurrence of any event specified in subsection 5.2(a) above, the outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock shall be converted into Common Stock automatically without the need for any further action by the
holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Company
or its transfer agent; provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion unless the certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred
Stock are either delivered to the Company or its transfer agent as provided below, or the holder notifies the
Company or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement
satisfactory to the Company to indemnify the Company from any loss incurred by it in connection with such
certificates. Upon the occurrence of such automatic conversion of the Preferred Stock, the holders of Preferred Stock
shall surrender the certificates representing such shares at the office of the Company or any transfer agent for the
Preferred Stock or Common Stock. Thereupon, there shall be issued and delivered to such holder promptly at such
office and in its name as shown on such surrendered certificate or certificates, a certificate or certificates for the
number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Preferred Stock surrendered were convertible on the
date on which such automatic conversion occurred, and any declared and unpaid dividends shall be paid in
accordance with the provisions of subsection 2.1.

5.3 Conversion Price. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible in accordance with subsection 5.1 or
subsection 5.2 above into the number of shares of Common Stock which results from dividing the applicable
Conversion Amount for such series (as defined below) by the conversion price for such series of Preferred Stock
that is in effect at the time of conversion (the “Conversion Price”). The “Conversion Amount” for the Series AA
Preferred

-10-
Stock shall be $1.606 and shall be subject to adjustment for any applicable preferred stock split, stock combination,
stock dividend or similar event after the Original Issue Date. The “Conversion Amount” for the Series BB Preferred
Stock shall be $1.606 and shall be subject to adjustment for any applicable preferred stock split, stock combination,
stock dividend or similar event after the Original Issue Date. The “Conversion Amount” for the Series CC Preferred
Stock shall be the Original Issue Price for the Series CC Preferred Stock and shall be subject to adjustment for any
applicable preferred stock split, stock combination, stock dividend or similar event after the Original Issue Date. The
initial Conversion Price for the Series AA Preferred Stock and the Series BB Preferred Stock shall be the Original
Issue Price for the Series BB Preferred Stock. The initial Conversion Price for the Series CC Preferred Stock shall
be the Original Issue Price for the Series CC Preferred Stock. The Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock
shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided below and also for any applicable preferred stock split,
stock combination, stock dividend or similar event after the Original Issue Date.

5.4 Adjustment Upon Common Stock Event. Upon the happening of a Common Stock Event (as hereinafter
defined), the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock shall, simultaneously with the happening of such
Common Stock Event, be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock in effect
immediately prior to such Common Stock Event by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which shall be the number of
shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to such Common Stock Event, and (11) the
denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately after
such Common Stock Event, and the product so obtained shall thereafter be the Conversion Price for such series of
Preferred Stock. The Conversion Price for a series of Preferred Stock shall be readjusted in the same manner upon
the happening of each subsequent Common Stock Event. As used herein, the term “Common Stock Event” shall
mean (i) the issue by the Company of additional shares of Common Stock as a dividend or other distribution on
outstanding Common Stock, (ii) a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of
shares of Common Stock, or (iii) a combination of the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number
of shares of Common Stock.

5.5 Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. If at any time or from time to time after the Original
Issue Date the Company pays a dividend or makes another distribution to the holders of the Common Stock payable
in securities of the Company other than shares of Common Stock, then in each such event provision shall be made
so that the holders of each series of Preferred Stock shall then receive the amount of securities of the Company
which they would have received had their Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock on the date of such
event (or such record date, as applicable). This subsection 5.5 takes precedence over Section 2, and accordingly
dividends payable in securities of the Company other than shares of Common Stock shall be governed by this
subsection 5.5 and not Section 2.

5.6 Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. If at any time or from time to time after the
Original Issue Date the Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of Preferred Stock is changed into the same or
a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by recapitalization, reclassification or
otherwise (other than by a Common Stock Event or a dividend covered by subsections 5.4 or 5.5, or a
reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale of assets provided for elsewhere in subsection 3.3 or subsection

-ll-
5.7), then in any such event each holder of Preferred Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such stock into
the kind and amount of stock and other securities and property receivable upon such recapitalization, reclassification
or other change by holders of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Preferred Stock
could have been converted immediately prior to such recapitalization, reclassification or change, all subject to
further adjustment as provided herein or with respect to such other securities or property by the terms thereof.

5.7 Reorganizations, Mergers and Consolidations. If at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue
Date there is a reorganization of the Company (other than a recapitalization, subdivision, combination,
reclassification or exchange of shares provided for elsewhere in this Section 5) or a merger or consolidation of the
Company with or into another corporation (except an event which is governed under subsection 3.3), then, as a part
of such reorganization, merger or consolidation, provision shall be made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock
thereafter shall be entitled to receive, upon conversion of the Preferred Stock, the number of shares of stock or other
securities or property of the Company, or of such successor corporation resulting from such reorganization, merger
or consolidation, to which a holder of that number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of the
Preferred Stock immediately prior to the closing of such reorganization, merger or consolidation would have been
entitled on such reorganization, merger or consolidation. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in
the application of the provisions of this Section 5 with respect to the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock after
the reorganization, merger or consolidation to the end that the provisions of this Section 5 (including adjustment of
the Conversion Price then in effect and number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be
applicable after that event and be as nearly equivalent to the provisions hereof as may be practicable. This
subsection 5.7 shall similarly apply to successive reorganizations, mergers and consolidations.

5.8 Sale of Shares Below Conversion Price.

(a) Adjustment Formula. If at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date the Company
issues or Sells, or is deemed by the provisions of this subsection 5.8 to have issued or sold, Additional Shares of
Common Stock (as hereinafter defined), otherwise than in connection with a Common Stock Event as provided in
subsection 5.4, a dividend or distribution as provided in subsection 5.5, or a recapitalization, reclassification or other
change as provided in subsection 5.6 or 5.7, for an Effective Price (as hereinafter defined) that is less than the
Conversion Price for an outstanding series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such issue or sale, then,
and in each such case, the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock shall be reduced, as of the close of
business on the date of such issue or sale, to the price obtained by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction:

(i) The numerator of which shall be the sum of (A) the number of Common Stock Equivalents
Outstanding (as hereinafter defined) immediately prior to such issue or sale of Additional Shares of Common Stock
plus (B) the quotient obtained by dividing the Aggregate Consideration Received (as hereinafter defined) by the
Company for the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued or sold (or deemed so issued and
sold) by the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such issue or sale; and

-12-
(ii) The denominator of which shall be the sum of (A) the number of Common Stock Equivalents
Outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale plus (B) the number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so
issued or sold (or deemed so issued and sold).

(b) Certain Definitions. For the purpose of making any adjustment required under this subsection 5.8:

(i) “Additional Shares of Common Stock” shall mean all shares of Common Stock issued by the
Company, whether or not subsequently reacquired or retired by the Company, other than: (A) shares of Common
Stock (or options, warrants, or other securities (including without limitation Preferred Stock) or rights directly or
indirectly exercisable or convertible therefore and the underlying Common Stock) outstanding on the Original Issue
Date; (B) shares of Common Stock (or options, warrants or rights directly or indirectly exercisable therefore and the
underlying Common Stock) issued to employees, officers or directors of, or contractors, consultants or advisers to,
the Company or any Subsidiary pursuant to stock purchase or stock option plans, stock bonuses or awards, or other
incentive stock arrangements that are approved by the Board; or (C) shares of Common Stock (or options, warrants
or rights directly or indirectly exercisable therefore and the underlying Common Stock) issued to lenders, equipment
lessors, or other parties providing goods or services to the Company, pursuant to contracts or other arrangements
that are approved by at least 80% of the members of the Board pursuant to resolutions acknowledging that anti-
dilution protection is being waived with respect to the issuance of such shares.

(ii) The “Aggregate Consideration Received” by the Company for any issue or sale (or deemed issue or
sale) of securities shall (A) to the extent it consists of cash, be computed at the gross amount of cash received by the
Company before deduction of any underwriting or similar commissions, compensation or concessions paid or
allowed by the Company in connection with such issue or sale and without deduction of any expenses payable by
the Company; (B) to the extent it consists of property other than cash, be computed at the fair value of that property
as determined in good faith by the Board; and (C) if Additional Shares of Common Stock, Convertible Securities or
Rights or Options to purchase either Additional Shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities are issued or
sold together with other stock or securities or other assets of the Company for a consideration which covers both, be
computed as the portion of the consideration so received that may be reasonably determined in good faith by the
Board to be allocable to such Additional Shares of Common Stock, Convertible Securities or Rights or Options.

(ili) “Common Stock Equivalents Outstanding” shall mean the number of shares of Common Stock that
is equal to the sum of (A) all shares of Common Stock of the Company that are outstanding at the time in question,
plus (B) all shares of Common Stock of the Company issuable upon conversion of all shares of Preferred Stock or
other Convertible Securities that are outstanding at the time in question, plus (C) all shares of Common Stock of the
Company that are issuable upon the exercise of Rights or Options that are outstanding at the time in question
assuming the full conversion or exchange into Common Stock of all such Rights or

-13-
Options that are Rights or Options to purchase or acquire Convertible Securities into or for Common Stock.

(iv) “Convertible Securities” shall mean stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for
shares of Common Stock.

(v) The “Effective Price” of Additional Shares of Common Stock shall mean the quotient determined by
dividing the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock issued or sold, or deemed to have been issued or
sold, by the Company under this subsection 5.8, into the Aggregate Consideration Received, or deemed to have been
received, by the Company under this subsection 5.8, for the issue of such Additional Shares of Common Stock; and

(vi) “Rights or Options” shall mean warrants, options or other rights to purchase or acquire shares of
Common Stock or Convertible Securities.

(c) Deemed Issuances. For the purpose of making any adjustment to the Conversion Price of any series of
Preferred Stock required under this subsection 5.8, if the Company issues or sells any Rights or Options or
Convertible Securities and if the Effective Price of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such
Rights or Options and/or the conversion or exchange of Convertible Securities (computed without reference to any
additional or similar protective or antidilution clauses) is less than the Conversion Price then in effect for a series of
Preferred Stock, then the Company shall be deemed to have issued, at the time of the issuance of such Rights,
Options or Convertible Securities, that number of Additional Shares of Common Stock that is equal to the maximum
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise or conversion of such Rights, Options or Convertible
Securities upon their issuance and to have received, as the Aggregate Consideration Received for the issuance of
such shares, an amount equal to the total amount of the consideration, if any, received by the Company for the
issuance of such Rights or Options or Convertible Securities, plus, in the case of such Rights or Options, the
minimum amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon the exercise in full of such Rights or
Options, plus, in the case of Convertible Securities, the minimum amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the
Company (other than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities) upon the

conversion or exchange thereof; provided that:

(i) if the minimum amounts of such consideration cannot be ascertained, but are a function of
antidilution or similar protective clauses, then the Company shall be deemed to have received the minimum amounts
of consideration without reference to such clauses;

(ii) if the minimum amount of consideration payable to the Company upon the exercise of Rights or
Options or the conversion or exchange of Convertible Securities is reduced over time or upon the occurrence or non-
occurrence of specified events other than by reason of antidilution or similar protective adjustments, then the
Effective Price shall be recalculated as of such date using the figure to which such minimum amount of
consideration is reduced; and

-14-
(iii) if the minimum amount of consideration payable to the Company upon the exercise of such Rights
or Options or the conversion or exchange of Convertible Securities is subsequently increased, then the Effective
Price shall again be recalculated as of such date using the increased minimum amount of consideration payable to
the Company upon the exercise of such Rights or Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities.

No further adjustment of the Conversion Price, adjusted upon the issuance of such Rights or Options or Convertible
Securities, shall be made as a result of the actual issuance of shares of Common Stock on the exercise of any such
Rights or Options or the conversion or exchange of any such Convertible Securities. If any such Rights or Options
or the conversion rights represented by any such Convertible Securities shall expire without having been fully
exercised, then the Conversion Price as adjusted upon the issuance of such Rights or Options or Convertible
Securities shall be readjusted to the Conversion Price which would have been in effect had an adjustment been made
on the basis that the only shares of Common Stock so issued were the shares of Common Stock, if any, that were
actually issued or sold on the exercise of such Rights or Options or rights of conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities, and such shares of Common Stock, if any, were issued or sold for the consideration actually
received by the Company upon such exercise, plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the Company for
the granting of all such Rights or Options, whether or not exercised, plus the consideration received for issuing or
selling all such Convertible Securities actually converted or exchanged, plus the consideration, if any, actually
received by the Company (other than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible
Securities) on the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, provided that such readjustment shall not
apply to prior conversions of Preferred Stock.

5.9 Certificate of Adjustment. In each case of an adjustment or readjustment of the Conversion Price for a
series of Preferred Stock, the Company, at its expense, shall cause its Chief Financial Officer to compute such
adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the provisions hereof and prepare a certificate showing such
adjustment or readjustment, and shall mail such certificate, by first class mail, postage prepaid, to each registered
holder of the Preferred Stock at the holder’s address as shown in the Company’s books.

5.10 Notices of Record Date. Upon (i) any taking by the Company of a record of the holders of any class of
securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend or other
distribution, or (ii) any Acquisition (as defined in subsection 3.3) or other capital reorganization of the Company,
any reclassification or recapitalization of the capital stock of the Company, any merger or consolidation of the
Company with or into any other corporation, or any Asset Transfer (as defined in subsection 3.3), or any voluntary
or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company, the Company shall mail to each holder of
Preferred Stock at least twenty (20) days prior to the record date specified therein a notice specifying (A) the date on
which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend or distribution and a description of such
dividend or distribution, (B) the date on which any such Acquisition, reorganization, reclassification,
recapitalization, consolidation, merger, Asset Transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to become
effective, and (C) the date, if any, that is to be fixed as to when the holders of record of

-15-
Common Stock (or other securities) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock (or other securities)
for securities or other property deliverable upon such Acquisition, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization,
consolidation, merger, Asset Transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up.

5.11 Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon any conversion of
Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional share to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the Company shall
pay the holder cash equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by the Common Stock’s fair market value as
determined in good faith by the Board as of the date of conversion.

5.12 Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Company shall at all times reserve and keep
available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the
conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock, such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to
time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the
number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all
then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, the Company will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion
of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of
shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.

5.13 Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Section 5 to be given to the holders of shares of the
Preferred Stock shall be deemed given upon the earlier of (i) actual receipt, (ii) deposit in the United States mail, by
certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or (iii) delivery to an express courier service,
fees prepaid, addressed to each holder of record at the address of such holder appearing on the books of the
Company.

5.14 Payment of Taxes. The Company will pay all taxes (other than taxes based upon income) and other
governmental charges that may be imposed with respect to the issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon
conversion of shares of Preferred Stock, excluding any tax or other charge imposed in connection with any transfer
involved in the issue and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in which the shares of
Preferred Stock so converted were registered.

6. Restrictions and Limitations.

6.1 Protective Provisions. So long at least 300,000 shares of Preferred Stock remain outstanding (as adjusted
for any applicable preferred stock split, stock combination, stock dividend or similar event after the Original Issue
Date), the Company shall not (by amendment, merger, consolidation or otherwise), without the approval, by vote or
written consent, of the holders of at least a majority of the Preferred Stock then outstanding (determined on an as-
converted-to-common basis as set forth in subsection 4.2), voting as a single class (except to the extent that separate
series votes are required by law):

of repurchase by the Company as approved by the unanimous consent of the Board);

excess of $500,000;

(10) establish a new equity incentive or stock option plan or increase the number of authorized shares

number is 7,564,261); or

(11) initiate voluntary dissolution or liquidation of the Company.
