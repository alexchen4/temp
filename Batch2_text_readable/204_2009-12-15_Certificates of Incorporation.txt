Securities, each holder of the Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred and Series C Preferred shall
be entitled to receive, respectively, pari passu (i) an amount in cash or, to the extent that cash is
not available, property, out of the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to the
stockholders, equal to the Series A Liquidation Value, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends
(whether or not declared) to which such holders shall be entitled pursuant to Section 2 hereof for
each share of Series A Preferred held by them, (ii) an amount in cash or, to the extent that cash is
not available, property, out of the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to the
stockholders, equal to the Series B Liquidation Value, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends
(whether or not declared) to which such holders shall be entitled pursuant to Section 2 hereof for
each share of Series B Preferred held by them and (iii) an amount in cash or, to the extent that
cash is not available, property, out of the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to
the stockholders, equal to the Series C Liquidation Value, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends
(whether or not declared) to which such holders shall be entitled pursuant to Section 2 hereof for
each share of Series C Preferred held by them. For purposes of this Section 1, unless waived by
the holders of at least two-thirds of the then outstanding Series A Preferred Shares, Series B
Preferred Shares and Series C Preferred Shares voting together as a single class on an as-
converted to Common Stock basis, the occurrence of a Fundamental Change shall be deemed to
be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation.

Preferred and Series C Preferred of the full preferential amounts provided for in Section 1(a),
upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the
entire remaining assets and funds of the Corporation legally available for distribution, if any,
shall be distributed ratably among the holders of the SeriesA Preferred Shares, Series B
Preferred Shares, Series C Preferred Shares and Common Shares in proportion to the number of
Common Shares held by such holders or issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred
Shares. Series B Preferred Shares and Series C Preferred Shares held by such holders, and based
upon the sum of the total number of Common Shares outstanding and the total number of
Common Shares issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Shares, Series B Preferred
Shares and Series C Preferred Shares.

ihe)

4810-8020-659713
(c) If upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, the assets of the Corporation available for
distribution are insufficient to permit the payment to the holders of Series A Preferred, Series B
Preferred and Series C Preferred of the full preferential amount payable to the holders of Series A
Preferred Shares, Series B Preferred Shares and Series C Preferred Shares provided in Section
i(a), then all of the assets of the Corporation available for distribution shall be distributed ratably
among the holders of the Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred and Series C Preferred in
proportion to the amounts that would be payable to such holders if the assets of the Corporation
were sufficient to permit payment of the preferential amounts in full.

Section 2. Dividends.

(a) When and as declared by the Board and to the extent permitted
under the Delaware Law, the Corporation shall pay preferential cumulative dividends to the
holders of Series A Preferred Shares, Series B Preferred Shares and Series C Preferred Shares as
provided in this Section 2. Except as otherwise provided herein, (i) dividends on each
outstanding share of Series A Preferred shall accrue on a daily basis at a rate of eight percent
(8%) per annum on the Series A Liquidation Value from and including the date of issuance of
such share of Series A Preferred to and including the earlier of the date on which the Series A
Liquidation Value of such share of Series A Preferred plus all accrued and unpaid dividends
thereon is paid or the date on which such share of Series A Preferred may be converted, (ii)
dividends on each outstanding share of Series B Preferred shall accrue on a daily basis at a rate
of eight percent (8%) per annum on the Series B Liquidation Value from and including the date
of issuance of such share of Series B Preferred to and including the earlier of the date on which
the Series B Liquidation Value of such share of Series B Preferred plus all accrued and unpaid
dividends thereon is paid or the date on which such share of Series B Preferred may be
converted, and (iii) dividends on each outstanding share of Series C Preferred shall accrue on a
daily basis at a rate of eight percent (8%) per annum on the Series C Liquidation Value from and
including the date of issuance of such share of Series C Preferred to and including the earlier of
the date on which the Series C Liquidation Value of such share of Series C Preferred plus all
accrued and unpaid dividends thereon is paid or the date on which such share of Series C
Preferred may be converted. Such dividends shall be cumulative and accrue whether or not they
have been declared and whether or not there are profits, surplus or other funds of the Corporation
legally available for the payment of dividends. Any accrued but unpaid dividends shall be paid
when, as and if, declared by the Board or as otherwise set forth in this Certificate of
Incorporation. All accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred
and Series C Preferred shall be fully paid or declared with funds irrevocably set apart for
payment before any dividend, distribution or payment may be made with respect to any Preferred
Shares (other than the SeriesA Preferred Shares, Series B Preferred Shares and Series C
Preferred Shares) or Junior Securities. The date on which the Corporation initially issues any
share of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to be its “date of issuance” regardless of the number of
times transfer of such share is made on the stock records maintained by or for the Corporation
and regardless of the number of certificates which may be issued to evidence such share.

(b) In addition to the preferential dividend right specified in Section
2(a) above, the holders of Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred and Scries C Preferred,
participating equally on an as if-converted basis, shall be entitled to receive dividends together

3

4810-8020-659713
with the holders of Common Stock in the manner set forth in this paragraph. The holders of
Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred and Series C Preferred shall be entitled to receive when, as
and if, declared by the Board, out of funds legally available therefor, a portion of any dividends
declared on shares of Common Stock, whether payable in cash or property, equal to the amount
of the dividend that would have been payable in respect of the shares of Common Stock into
which all outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred and Series C Preferred
could have been converted on the date of the declaration of the dividend.

(c) No dividend shall be declared or paid and no sum shall be set apart
therefore on any Junior Securities unless and until all dividends payable on the SeriesA
Preferred, Series B Preferred and Series C Preferred shall have been declared and paid or a sum
set apart for such payment. Except as otherwise provided herein, if at any time the Corporation
pays less than the total amount of preferential dividends then accrued with respect to all
outstanding shares of Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred and Series C Preferred, such
payment shall be distributed ratably among the holders of the SeriesA Preferred, Series B
Preferred and Series C Preferred in proportion to the amount of dividends that would be payable
to such holders if such payment were sufficient to pay the then accrued preferential dividends in
full.

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 2 to the
contrary, the holders of Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to receive any dividends in
connection with and following a Qualified Public Offering (as defined herein).

Section 3. Voting Rights. The Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred and Series C
Preferred shall have those voting rights set forth for the SeriesA Preferred Shares, Series B
Preferred Shares and Series C Preferred Shares in PART C below.

Section 4. Conversion.
4.] Conversion Procedure.

(a) At any time and from time to time, any holder of Series A
Preferred Shares, Series B Preferred Shares or Series C Preferred Shares may convert all or any
portion of the Series A Preferred Shares, Series B Preferred Shares or Series C Preferred Shares
(including any fraction of a share) held by such holder into the number of shares of Common
Stock obtained by adding (i) the number of shares determined by (A) multiplying the number of
Series A Preferred Shares, Series B Preferred Shares or Series C Preferred Shares to be converted
by the Series A Liquidation Value, Series B Liquidation Value or Series C Liquidation Value,
respectively, and (B) dividing the resulting product by the Series A Conversion Price, Series B
Conversion Price or Series C Conversion Price, as applicable, (as provided in Section 4.2(a)
below) then in effect, plus (ii) the number of shares determined by dividing the total amount of
any accrued and unpaid dividends with respect to such Series A Preferred Shares, Series B
Preferred Shares or Series C Preferred Shares to be converted by the Series A Conversion Price,
Series B Conversion Price or Series C Conversion Price, as applicable, then in effect.

(b) Each conversion of Preferred Shares will be deemed to have been
effected as of the close of business on the date on which the stockholder delivers written notice

4810-8020-659713
to the Corporation at its principal office of its desire to convert shares of Preferred Stock and
surrenders the certificate or certificates representing the Preferred Shares to be converted. At
such time as such conversion has been effected, the rights of the holder of such Preferred Shares
as such holder wil] cease and the Person or Persons in whose name or names any certificate or
certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued upon such conversion will be deemed to
have become the holder or holders of record of the shares of Common Stock represented thereby.
All shares of Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred or Series C Preferred tendered for conversion
shall, from and after the date of conversion, be deemed to have been retired and cancelled and
shall not be reissued as Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred or Series C Preferred and the
Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate action as may be necessary to reduce
accordingly the authorized number of shares of Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred or Series C
Preferred .

(c) As soon as possible after a conversion has been effected (but in
any event within five (5) business days in the case of Sections 4.1(c)(i) and 4.1(c)(iii) below), the
Corporation will deliver to the converting holder:

(i) a certificate or certificates representing the number of shares of Common
Stock issuable by reason of such conversion in such name or names and such
denomination or denominations as the converting holder has specified;

(ii) | payment of the amount payable under Section 4.1(f) below with respect to
such conversion; and

(iii) | acertificate representing any Series A Preferred Shares, Series B Preferred
Shares or Series C Preferred Shares that were represented by the certificate or certificates
delivered to the Corporation in connection with such conversion but which were not
converted.

(d) The issuance of certificates for shares of Common Stock upon
conversion of Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred or Series C Preferred will be made without
charge to the holders of such Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred or Series C Preferred for any
issuance tax in respect thereof or other cost incurred by the Corporation in connection with such
conversion and the related issuance of shares of Common Stock. Upon conversion of each
Series A Preferred Share, Series B Preferred Share or Series C Preferred Share, the Corporation
will take all such actions as are necessary in order to insure that the Common Stock issuable with
respect to such conversion will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

(e) The Corporation will not close its books against the transfer of
shares of Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred or Series C Preferred or Common Stock issued or
issuable upon conversion of shares of Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred or Series C
Preferred in any manner that interferes with the timely conversion of Series A Preferred, Series B
Preferred or Series C Preferred .

(f) If any fractional interest in a share of Common Stock would,

except for the provisions of this Section 4.1(f}, be deliverable upon any conversion of the Series
A Preferred, Series B Preferred or Series C Preferred, the Corporation, in lieu of delivering the

$810-8020-659713
fractional share therefor, may pay an amount to the holder thereof equal to the fair market value
(as reasonably determined in good faith by the Board) of such fractional interest as of the date of
conversion.

(g) | The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available, out
of its authorized but unissued Common Stock, such number of Common Shares as would be
issuable upon the conversion of all Series A Preferred Shares, Series B Preferred Shares and
Series C Preferred Shares then outstanding.

4.2 Conversion Prices.

(a) Initial Conversion Price. The initial “Series A Conversion Price”
will be $0.6925, the initial “Series B Conversion Price” will be $0.8905 and the initial “Series C
Conversion Price” will be $0.99. In order to prevent dilution of the conversion rights granted to
holders of Series A Preferred Shares, Series B Preferred Shares and Series C Preferred Shares
hereunder, the Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price and Series C Conversion
Price will be subject to adjustment from time to time pursuant to this Section 4.2 and Sections
4.4 and 4.5 of this PART A. For purposes of this Section 4.2, the Corporation shall be deemed to
have issued or sold Common Stock under the circumstances as set forth in Section 4.3 below.

(b) Adjustment for Dilutive Events. If and whenever on or after the
original date of issuance of the Series C Preferred, the Corporation issues or sells, or in
accordance with Section 4.3 below is deemed to have issued or sold, any shares of Common
Stock (or any Options or Convertible Securities, in each case, as defined below) for
consideration per share less than the applicable Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion
Price or Series C Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the time of such issue or sale (a
“Dilutive Event”), then forthwith upon the occurrence of any such Dilutive Event, the Series A
Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price and Series C Conversion Price, as applicable, will
be reduced (in order to increase the number of shares of Common Stock into which such Series A
Preferred Shares, Series B Preferred Shares and Series C Preferred Shares are convertible) to that
price per share determined by dividing (i) the sum of (x) the product derived by multiplying the
Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series C Conversion Price, as
applicable, in effect immediately prior to such Dilutive Event, times the number of shares of
Common Stock Deemed Outstanding immediately prior to the Dilutive Event plus (y) the
aggregate consideration (if any) received by the Corporation for the total number of such shares
of Common Stock so issued or sold, or deemed issued or sold, in such Dilutive Event by (ii) the
number of shares of Common Stock Deemed Outstanding immediately after such Dilutive Event.
Additional shares of Common Stock issued or sold (or deemed issued or sold) without
consideration shall be deemed to have been sold for $0.01 per share. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, the issuance by the Corporation of (i) options or other rights to acquire up
to 1,721,480 shares of Common Stock (as adjusted for stock dividends, splits, combinations and
the like with respect to the Common Stock), and the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon
exercise thereof, issued pursuant to stock option plans, stock option grants or other similar
arrangements to officers, directors, employees and consultants approved by the Board, including
the Series B Director (as that term is defined in the Second Amended and Restated Stockholders
Agreement); (ii) shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to a transaction described in
Section 4.4 below; (iii) the Series A Preferred Shares and Series B Preferred Shares issued prior

4810-8020-65973
to the date hereof and shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such Series A
Preferred Shares and Series B Preferred Shares; (iv) the Series C Preferred Shares issued
pursuant to the Series C Stock Purchase Agreement and shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of such Series C Preferred Shares; (v) shares of Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of the Nidus Warrant, the Advisory Fee Warrant, or the Bridge Loan Warrants; (vi)
Series A Preferred Shares issuable upon exercise of the Venture Warrants: (vii) shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Shares issuable upon exercise
of the Venture Warrants; (viii) securities issued pursuant to financing leases or similar
arrangements approved by holders of not less than two-thirds of the then outstanding Series A
Preferred Shares, Series B Preferred Shares and Series C Preferred Shares, voting together as a
single class on an as-converted to Common Stock basis; (ix) securities issued other than for cash
to strategic partners, lenders or lessors of the Corporation pursuant to strategic partnerships or
other transactions approved by holders of not less than two-thirds of the then outstanding Series
A Preferred Shares, Series B Preferred Shares and Series C Preferred Shares, voting together as a
single class on an as-converted to Common Stock basis; (ix) Common Stock or securities
convertible into or exercisable for Common Stock, approved by holders of not less than two-
thirds of the then outstanding Series A Preferred Shares, Series B Preferred Shares and Series C
Preferred Shares, voting together as a single class on an as-converted to Common Stock basis, as
securities excluded from the Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price and Series C
Conversion Price adjustment provisions provided for herein, shall not constitute a Dilutive
Event.

4.3 Common Stock Deemed Outstanding. For purposes of determining an
adjusted Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series C Conversion Price, as

the case may be, pursuant to Section 4.2(b) above, the following shall be deemed to be an
issuance and sale of Common Stock by the Corporation and the “Common Stock Deemed
Qutstanding” shall be the number of shares of Common Stock actually issued and outstanding
plus (i) the number of shares of Common Stock that would be outstanding assuming the full
exercise and conversion of all outstanding options, warrants, purchase rights, and convertible
securities, exercisable or convertible for Common Stock (or any securities which are further
exercisable for or convertible into Common Stock), including, but not limited to, the Common
Stock that would be issuable upon conversion of the outstanding Series A Preferred, Series B
Preferred and Series C Preferred; and (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock deemed issued
or sold pursuant to Sections 4.3(a) and 4.3(b) below regardless of whether such Options or
Convertible Securities are actually exercisable at such time (without duplication for any options,
warrants, purchase rights, and convertible securities included under clause (i) immediately
preceding).

(a) Issuance of Rights or Options. If (i) the Corporation in any
manner grants any rights or options to subscribe for or to purchase shares of Common Stock or

any securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock (such rights: or
options referred to herein as “Options” and such convertible or exchangeable stock or securities
referred to hercin as “Convertible Securities”) whether or not such Options or the right to convert
or exchange any such Convertible Securities are immediately exercisable and (ii) the Price Per
Share of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Options or upon conversion
or exchange of such Convertible Securities is less than the Series A Conversion Price, Series B
Conversion Price or Series C Conversion Price, as applicable, in effect immediately prior to the

7
4810-8020-6S97\3
time of the granting of such Options, then (x) the total maximum number of shares of such
Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Options or upon conversion or exchange of
the total maximum number of Convertible Securities issuable upon the exercise of such Options
will be deemed to be Common Stock issued and sold by the Corporation, (y) the consideration
received pursuant to the Dilutive Event will equal the Price Per Share times the number of shares
of Common Stock so deemed issued and sold by the Corporation and (z) the number of shares of
Common Stock so deemed issued and sold by the Corporation shall be included in the Common
Stock Deemed Outstanding immediately after such Dilutive Event. For purposes of this Section
4.3(a), the “Price Per Share” will be determined by dividing (i) the total amount, if any, received
or receivable by the Corporation as consideration for the granting of such Options, plus the
minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration payable to the Corporation upon exercise
of all such Options, plus in the case of such Options which relate to Convertible Securities, the
minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to the Corporation upon
the issuance or sale of such Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange thereof, by
(ii) the total maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such
Options or upon the conversion or exchange of all such Convertible Securities issuable upon the
exercise of such Options. No further adjustment of the Series A Conversion Price, Series B
Conversion Price or Series C Conversion Price will be made when Convertible Securities are
actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or when Common Stock is actually issued
upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities;
provided, that, if such Options expire or lapse without being exercised and/or converted into
Common Stock, then the Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series C
Conversion Price, as the case may be, will be readjusted to the Series A Conversion Price,
Series B Conversion Price or Series C Conversion Price which would have been in effect had
such expired or lapsed Options not been issued.

(b) Issuance of Convertible Securities. If (i) the Corporation in any
manner issues or sells any Convertible Securities whether or not the right to convert or exchange
any such Convertible Securities are immediately exercisable and (ii) the Price Per Share of
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion or exchange is less than the Series A
Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series C Conversion Price, as applicable, in
effect immediately prior to the time of such issue or sale, then (x) the maximum number of
shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities
will be deemed to be Common Stock issued and sold by the Corporation, (y) the consideration
received pursuant to the Dilutive Event will equal the Price Per Share times the number of shares
of Common Stock so deemed issued and sold by the Corporation and (z) the number of shares of
Common Stock so deemed issued and sold by the Corporation shall be included in the Common
Stock Deemed Outstanding immediately after such Dilutive Event. For the purposes of this
Section 4.3(b), the “Price Per Share” will be determined by dividing (i) the total amount received
or receivable by the Corporation as consideration for the issue or sale of such Convertible
Securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to the
Corporation upon the conversion or exchange thereof, by (ii) the total maximum number of
shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion or exchange of all such Convertible
Securities. No further adjustment of the Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or
Series C Conversion Price will be made when Common Stock is actually issued upon the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, and if any such issue or sale of such
Convertible Securities is made upon exercise of any Options for which adjustments to the

8
4810-8020-65973
Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series C Conversion Price had been or
are to be made pursuant to Section 4.3(a) above, no further adjustment of the SeriesA
Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series C Conversion Price will be made by
reason of such issue or sale; provided, that, if such Convertible Securities expire or lapse without
being exercised and/or converted into Common Stock, then the Series A Conversion Price,
Series B Conversion Price or Series C Conversion Price, as the case may be, will be readjusted to
the Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series C Conversion Price which
would have been in effect had such expired or lapsed Convertible Securities not been issued.

(c) Change in Option Price or Conversion Rate. If at any time there is

a change in (i) the purchase price provided for in any Options, (ii) the additional consideration, if
any, payable upon the conversion or exchange of any Convertible Securities, or (iii) the rate at
which any Convertible Securities are convertible or exchangeable for Common Stock, then the
Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series C Conversion Price, as the case
may be, in effect at the time of such change will be readjusted to the Series A Conversion Price,
Series B Conversion Price or Series C Conversion Price which would have been in effect had
those Options or Convertible Securities still outstanding at the time of such change provided for
such changed purchase price, additional consideration or changed conversion rate, as the case
may be, at the time such Options or Convertible Securities were initially granted, issued or sold
but only if as a result of such adjustment the Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion
Price or Series C Conversion Price then in effect hereunder would have been reduced; and on the
termination of any such Option or any right to convert or exchange such Convertible Securities,
the Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series C Conversion Price, as the
case may be, then in effect hereunder shall forthwith be increased to the Series A Conversion
Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series C Conversion Price which would have been in effect
at the time of such termination had such Option or Convertible Securities, to the extent
outstanding immediately prior to such termination, never been issued.

(d) Calculation of Consideration Received. If any shares of Common
Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold
for cash, the consideration received therefor or the Price Per Share, as the case may be, will be
deemed to be the net amount received or to be received by the Corporation therefor. In case any
shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are issued or sold for a consideration
other than cash, the amount of the consideration other than cash received by the Corporation or
the non-cash portion of the Price Per Share, as the case may be, will be the Fair Market Value of
such consideration received or to be received, respectively, by the Corporation; except where
such consideration consists of securities, in which case the amount of consideration received or
to be received, respectively, by the Corporation will be the Market Price thereof as of the date of
receipt. If any shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are issued in
connection with any merger in which the Corporation is the surviving corporation, the amount of
consideration therefor will be deemed to be the Fair Market Value of such portion of the net
assets and business of the non-surviving corporation as is attributable to such shares of Common
Stock, Options or Convertible Securities, as the case may be.

(e) Integrated Transactions. In case any Option is issued in connection
with the issuance or sale of other securities of the Corporation, together comprising one

4810-8020-659713
integrated transaction in which no specific consideration is allocated to such Option by the
parties thereto, the Option will be deemed to have been issued for a consideration of $0.01.

(f Treasury Shares. The number of shares of Common Stock
Deemed Outstanding at any given time shall not include shares owned or held by or for the
account of the Corporation, and the disposition of any shares so owned or held shall be
considered an issuance or sale of Common Stock by the Corporation.

(g) Record Date. If the Corporation takes a record of the holders of
Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them (i) to receive a dividend or other distribution
payable in shares of Common Stock, Options or in Convertible Securities or (ii) to subscribe for
or purchase shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities, then such record date
will be deemed to be the date of the issuance or sale of the shares of Common Stock deemed to
have been issued or sold upon the declaration of such dividend or upon the making of such other
distribution or the date of the granting of such right of subscription or purchase, as the case may
be.

4.4 Subdivision or Combination of Common Stock. Ifthe Corporation at any
time subdivides (by any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or otherwise) its outstanding
shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, the Series A Conversion Price,
Series B Conversion Price and Series C Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such
subdivision will be proportionately reduced so that the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon conversion of each share of Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred and Series C
Preferred shall be increased in proportion to such increase of the aggregate number of shares of
outstanding Common Stock. If the Corporation at any time combines (by reverse stock split or
otherwise) its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, the Series A
Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price and SeriesC Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such combination will be proportionately increased so that the number of
shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of each share of Series A Preferred, Series B
Preferred and Series C Preferred shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease of the
aggregate number of shares of outstanding Common Stock.

4.5 Organic Change. Upon the consummation of an Organic Change, the
terms of the Preferred Stock shall be deemed modified, without payment of any additional
consideration therefor, so as to provide that upon the conversion of the Preferred Shares
following the consummation of such Organic Change, the holder of such Preferred Shares shall
have the right to acquire and receive (in lieu of or in addition to the shares of Common Stock
acquirable and receivable prior to the Organic Change) such shares of stock, securities or assets
as such holder would have received if such holder had converted its Preferred Shares into
Common Stock immediately prior to such Organic Change, in each case giving effect to any
adjustment of the Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series C Conversion
Price, as the case may be, made after the date of consummation of the Organic Change. All other
terms of the Preferred Stock shal] remain in full force and effect following such an Organic
Change. The provisions of this Section 4.5 shall similarly apply to successive Organic Changes.
