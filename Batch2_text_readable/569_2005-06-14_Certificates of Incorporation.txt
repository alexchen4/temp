nonassessable shares (calculated as to each conversion to the Jargest whole number of shares)
of Common Stock on the following terms:

(a) General. The number of shares of Common Stock to which a holder of
Preferred Shares shall be entitled upon conversion shall be the product obtained by

substantially all of the Corporation’s properties and assets to any other person, then, as a part
of such reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale, provision shall be made so that the
holders of the Preferred Shares shall be entitled to convert their Preferred Shares into shares
of Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.2.6(a) above and thereafter receive the
number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the Corporation, or of the
successor corporation resulting from such reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale, to
which a holder of a like number of shares of Common Stock would be entitled on such
capital reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale.

(d) Surrender of Certificates. Upon the occurrence of a conversion
specified in Section 2.2.6, the holders of such Preferred Shares shall surrender the certificates
representing such shares at the office of the Corporation or of its transfer agent for the
Common Stock. Thereupon, the Corporation or its transfer agent shall issue and deliver to
such holder a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which
the Preferred Shares surrendered were convertible on the date on which such conversion
occurred. The Corporation shal! not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion unless certificates evidencing such Preferred
Shares being converted are delivered to the Corporation or any such transfer agent or the
holder notifies the Corporation or any such transfer agent that such certificates have been
lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to
indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection therewith.

effect at any time (the “Conversion Rate”) shall be the quotient obtained by dividing the
applicable Original Issue Price by the Conversion Value, calculated as provided in

(f) Conversion Values. The initial “Conversion Value” of the Preferred
Shares shall be $1.00, provided that such amount shall be adjusted from time to time in
accordance with this Section 2.2.6.

(g) Adjustments to Conversion Values for Certain Splits and
Combinations. The Conversion Value shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as
follows:

(1) in the event the Corporation should at any time or from time to
lime after the date upon which any shares of Series AA Preferred were first issued (the
“Issuance Date”) fix a record date for the effectuation of a split or subdivision of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock or the determination of holders of Common Stock
entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of Common
Stock or other securities or rights convertible into, or entitling the holder thereof to receive
directly or indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock (hereinafter referred to as
“Common Stock Equivalents”) without payment of any consideration by such holder for the
additional shares of Common Stock or the Common Stock Equivalents (including the
additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof), then, as of
such record date (or the date of such dividend, distribution, split or subdivision if no record
date is fixed), the Conversion Value shall be appropriately decreased so that the number of
shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each Preferred Share shall be increased in
proportion to such increase of the aggregate of shares of Common Stock outstanding and
those issuable with respect to such Common Stock Equivalents, with the number of shares
issuable with respect to Common Stock Equivalents determined from time to time in the
manner provided for dcemed issuances in Section 2.2.6(h)(2)(E).

(2) If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any
time after the Issuance Date is decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock, then, following the record date of such combination, the Conversion Value
shall be appropriately increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on
conversion of each Preferred Share shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in
outstanding shares of Common Stock.

(h) Conversion Value Adjustments for Certain Dilutive Issuances.

(1) Additional Stock. For purposes of this Section 2.2.6(h), the
term “Additional Stock” shall mean any shares of Common Stock issued (or deemed to have

consultants, officers or directors of the Corporation directly or pursuant to a stock option plan

conversion to Common Stock of all convertible securities and the exercise of all outstanding
options and warrants as well as any shares authorized but not yet granted pursuant to any
such plans),

stock, issued to financial institutions or lessors in connection with commercial credit

(D Up to 6,500,000 shares of Series AA Preferred.

(2) Adjustment of Conversion Values. The Conversion Value
shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

(A) _ Ifthe Corporation shall issue, after the Issuance Date,
any Additional Stock without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the
Conversion Value in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock (a
“Dilutive Issuance”), then and in each such case, the then-existing Conversion Value shall
be reduced, as of the opening of business on the date of such issuance, to a price equal to an
amount determined by multiplying such then-existing Conversion Value by a fraction:

(i) the numerator of which shall be (a) the number
of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of such
Additional Stock (calculated on a fully diluted basis assuming the exercise or
conversion of all presently exercisable options, warrants, purchase nights or
convertible securities), plus (b) the number of shares of Common Stock that the net
aggregate consideration, if any, received by the Corporation for the total amount of
such Additional Stock so issued would purchase at the Conversion Value in effect
immediately prior to such issuance, and

(ii) the denominator of which shall be (a) the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of
such Additional Stock (calculated on a fully diluted basis assuming the exercise or
conversion of all presently exercisable options, warrants, purchase rights or

convertible securities), plus (b) the number of shares of such Additional Stock so
issued.
(B) No adjustment of the Conversion Value shalt be made
in an amount less than one cent ($0.01) per share, provided that any adjustments that are not
required to be made by reason of this sentence shall be cared forward and shall be either
taken into account in any subsequent adjustment made pnor to three (3) years from the date
of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward, or shall be made at the end of
three (3) years from. the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward.
Except to the limited extent provided for in subparagraphs (h)(2)(E)(ili) and (iv), no
adjustment of such Conversion Value pursuant to this subsection (h)(2) shall have the effect
of increasing the Conversion Value above the Conversion Value in effect immediately prior
to such adjustment.

(C) In the case of the issuance of Additional Stock for cash,
the consideration shall bc deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting
any reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the
Corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale
thereof.

(D) In the case of the issuance of Additional Stock for a
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be
deemed to be the fair value thereof as determined by the Board of Directors irrespective of
any accounting treatment.

(E) In the case of the issuance (whether before, on or after
the Issuance Date) of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common Stock, securities
by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock or options to purchase or
rights to subscribe for such convertible or exchangeable securities, the following provisions
shall apply for all purposes of this Section 2.2.6(h)(2) and Section 2.2.6(g):

(i) The aggregate maximum number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable upon exercise (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions
to exercisability, including without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking
into account potential antidilution adjustments) of such options to purchase or rights
to subscribe for Common Stock shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such
options or rights were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration
(determined in the manner provided in subsections (h)(2)(C) and (h)(2)(D)), if any,
received by the Corporation upon the issuance of such options or rights plus the
minimum exercise price provided in such options or rights (without taking into
account potential antidilution adjustments) for the Common Stock covered thereby.

(ii) | The aggregate maximum number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of or in exchange (assuming the
satisfaction of any conditions to convertibility or exchangeability, including, without
limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account potential antidilution
adjustments) for any such convertible or exchangeable securities or upon the exercise

-9.
of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or exchangeable
securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof shall be deemed to have
been issued at the time such securities were issued or such options or rights were
issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration, if any, received by the
Corporation for any such secuntties and related options or rights (excluding any cash
received on account of accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the minimum
additional consideration, if any, to be received by the Corporation (without taking into
account potential antidilution adjustments) upon the conversion or exchange of such
securities or the exercise of any related options or rights (the consideration in each
case to be determined in the manner provided in subsections (h)(2)(C) and (h)(2)(D)).

(iii) In the event of any change in the number of
shares of Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to the
Corporation upon exercise of such options or rights, or upon conversion of or in
exchange for such convertible or exchangeable securities, including, but not limited
to, a change resulting from the antidilution provisions thereof, the Conversion Value,
to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, rights or
securities, shall be recomputed to reflect such change, but no further adjustment shall
be made for the actual issuance of Common Stock or any payment of such
consideration upon the exercise of any such options or rights or the conversion or
exchange of such securities.

(iv) | Upon the expiration of any such options or
tights, the termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of
any options or rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the
Conversion Value, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such
options, rights or securities or options or rights related to such securities, shall be
recomputed to reflect the issuance of only the number of shares of Common Stock
(and convertible or exchangeable securities that remain in effect) actually issued upon
the exercise of such options or rights, upon the conversion or exchange of such
securities or upon the exercise of the options or rights related to such securities.

(v) | The number of shares of Common Stock
deemed issued and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to
subsections (h)(2)(E)(i) and (ii) shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect any change,
termination or expiration of the type described in either subsection (h)(2)(E)(iii)
or (iv).

(i) Certificate of Adjustment. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or

readjustment of the Conversion Value pursuant to Section 2.2.6(h), the Corporation shall
promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and
prepare and furnish to each holder of Preferred Shares a certificate setting forth such

adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the method of calculation upon which such
adjustment or readjustment is based.

-10-
Qj) Cash in Lieu of Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common
Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of Preferred Shares. Instead of any fractional
shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be issuable upon conversion of Preferred
Shares, the Corporation shall pay to the holder of the Preferred Shares that were converted a
cash adjustment in respect of such fractional shares in an amount equal to the product of such
fractional amount multiplied by the market price per share of the Common Stock (as
determined in a reasonable manner prescribed by the Board of Directors) at the close of
business on the date of conversion. The determination as to whether or not any fractional
shares are issuable shal] be based upon the total number of Preferred Shares being converted
at any one time by any holder thereof, not upon each Preferred Share being converted.

(k) Reservation of Common Stock. The Corporation shall at all times
reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock, solely
for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Preferred Shares, such number of its shares
of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all
outstanding Preferred Shares. If at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of
Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding
Preferred Shares, the Corporation shall take such corporate action as may be necessary to
increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as
shall be sufficient for such purpose.

(I) Status of Converted Stock. In the event any Preferred Shares shall be
converted pursuant to Section 2.2.6 hereof, the shares so converted shall be canceled and
shall not be issuable by the Corporation.

(m) If at any time any shares of Series AA Preferred are converted into
Common Stock there are any accrued but unpaid dividends on such shares, then the
Corporation at its option shall either pay the unpaid dividends or issue additional shares of
Common Stock in the amount of the unpaid dividends at the applicable fair market value for
such shares then in effect.

2.2.7 Other Distributions

In the event the Corporation shall declare a distribution payable in securities of other
persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by the Corporation or other persons, assets
(cxcluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred to in Section 2.2.6(g), then, in
each such case for the purpose of this Section 2.2.7, the holders of Preferred Shares shall be
entitled to a proportionate share of any such distribution as though they were the holders of
the number of shares of Common Stock into which their Preferred Shares are convertible as
of the record date fixed for the determination of the holders of Common Stock entitled to
receive such distribution.

-}I-

Preferred, not redeemed shall remain outstanding and entitled to all the rights and preferences
provided herein, including the rights of conversion set forth herein. If any time thereafter
additional funds become legally available for the redemption, such funds immediately will be
used to redeem the balance of the shares that the Corporation had become obliged to redeem
on any Redemption Date but that it has not redeemed.

(c) At least thirty days prior to each Redemption Date, the Corporation
shal] mail a redemption notice (the “Redemption Notice”), first class postage prepaid, to
cach holder of record of Preferred Shares as of the close of business two business days
preceding the mailing date, at the address last shown on the records of the Corporation for
such holder. The Redemption Notice shall specify the number of shares to be redeemed from
such holder, the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price and the place at which payment
may be obtained, and shall call upon such holder to surrender to the Corporation, in the
manner and at the place designated, the certificate or certificates representing the shares to be
redeemed. On or after the Redemption Date, each holder of Preferred Shares to be redeemed
shall surrender to the Corporation the certificate or certificates representing such shares, in
the manner and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice. Each surrendered
certificate shall be cancelled, and the Redemption Price for such shares shall then be payable
to the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner
thereof. If less than all the shares represented by any such certificate are redeemed, a new
certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares. Nothing herein shall be
deemed to prevent a holder of Preferred Shares from converting all or part of such holder’s
shares into Common Stock in accordance with the terms of Section 2.2.6 hereof at any time
prior to a Redemption Date covering such shares, and the provisions of this Section 2.2.10
shall not apply to any shares so converted.

(d) From and after the Redemption Date, unless there has been a default in
payment of the Redemption Price, the Preferred Shares designated for redemption in the
Redemption Notice shall cease to be outstanding and shall no longer be transferred on the
books of the Corporation, and all rights of the holders with respect to such shares shall cease,
except the right to receive the Redemption Price without interest upon surrender of their
certificate or certificates.

(e) Except as provided in this Section 2.2.10, the Corporation shal! have
no right to redeem the Preferred Shares. Any Preferred Shares so redeemed shall be
permanently retired, shall no longer be deemed outstanding and shall not under any
circumstances be reissued, and the Corporation may from time to time take such appropriate

corporate action as may be necessary to reduce the number of shares of authorized Series AA
Preferred, accordingly.
