respectively, “Common Stock” and “Preferred Stock.” The total number of shares which the
Company is authorized to issue is 169,015,000 shares, 95,000,000 shares of which shall be
Common Stock (the “Common Stock”) and 74,015,000 shares of which shall be Preferred Stock
(the “Preferred Stock”). The Preferred Stock shall have a par value of $0.001 per share and the
Common Stock shall have a par value of $0.001 per share.

B. The number of authorized shares of Common Stock may be increased or
decreased (but not below the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding) by the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock of the Company entitled to vote (voting
together as a single class on an as-if-converted basis).

722669 v8/SD
Cc. 3,015,000 of the authorized shares of Preferred Stock are hereby designated
“Series A Preferred Stock” (the “Series A Preferred”). 34,700,000 of the authorized shares of
Preferred Stock are hereby designated “Series B Preferred Stock” (the “Series B Preferred”).
2,000,000 of the authorized shares of Preferred Stock are hereby designated “Series B-1
Preferred Stock” (the “Series B-I Preferred”). 300,000 of the authorized shares of Preferred
Stock are hereby designated “Series B-2 Preferred Stock” (the “Series B-2 Preferred”).
34,000,000 of the authorized shares of Preferred Stock are hereby designated “Series C Preferred
Stock” (the “Series C Preferred”).

D. Effective immediately upon the date and time of filing of this Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Filing Date”), each share of Series B Preferred
outstanding immediately prior to the Filing Date shall be combined and converted, automatically
and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, into 2.637 shares of Series B Preferred
(the “Stock Split”). The Corporation shall not issue any fractional shares of Series B Preferred
in connection with the Stock Split, but shall instead pay to any stockholder of record of Series B
Preferred who would be entitled to receive any fractional shares of Series B Preferred as a result
of the Stock Split (after aggregating all fractional shares of Series B Preferred to be received by
such stockholder of record as a result of the Stock Split) a sum in cash equal to the fair market
value of any such fractional shares as determined by the Board of Directors of the Corporation
(the “Board”). All certificates representing shares of Series B Preferred outstanding
immediately prior to the Filing Date shall immediately upon the Filing Date represent a number
of shares of Series B Preferred as provided above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any holder of
Series B Preferred immediately prior to the Filing Date may (but shall not be required to)
surrender his, her or its stock certificate or certificates to the Corporation, and upon such
surrender the Corporation will issue a certificate for the correct number of shares of Series B
Preferred to which such stockholder is entitled as provided above. All numbers of shares, and all
amounts stated on a per share basis, contained in this Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, including those set forth in this Article IV, are stated after giving effect to the
Stock Split and no further adjustment shall be made as a consequence thereof.

aside for each share of Common Stock.

(f) The provisions of Sections 1(d) and I(e) shall not apply to a
dividend payable solely in Common Stock to which the provisions of Section 5(f) hereof are

(ii) For so long as at least 500,000 shares of Series A Preferred
remain outstanding (subject to adjustment for any stock split, reverse stock split or similar event
affecting the Series A Preferred after the Filing Date) the holders of Series A Preferred, voting as
a separate class, shall be entitled to elect one member of the Board at each meeting or pursuant to
each consent of the Company’s stockholders for the election of directors, and to remove from
office such director and to fill any vacancy caused by the resignation, death or removal of such
director.

(iii) |The holders of Common Stock, voting as a separate class,
shall be entitled to elect one member of the Board at each meeting or pursuant to each consent of

722669 v8/SD
the Company’s stockholders for the election of directors, and to remove from office such
directors and to fill any vacancy caused by the resignation, death or removal of such directors.

(iv) | The holders of Common Stock and Series Preferred, voting
together as a single class on an as-if-converted basis, shall be entitled to elect all remaining
members of the Board at each meeting or pursuant to each consent of the Company’s
stockholders for the election of directors, and to remove from office such directors and to fill any

During such time or times that the Company is subject to Section 2115(b) of the CGCL, every
stockholder entitled to vote at an election for directors may cumulate such stockholder’s votes
and give one candidate a number of votes equal to the number of directors to be elected
multiplied by the number of votes to which such stockholder’s shares are otherwise entitled, or
distribute the stockholder’s votes on the same principle among as many candidates as such
stockholder desires. No stockholder, however, shall be entitled to so cumulate such
stockholder’s votes unless (i) the names of such candidate or candidates have been placed in
nomination prior to the voting and (ii) the stockholder has given notice at the meeting, prior to
the voting, of such stockholder’s intention to cumulate such stockholder’s votes. If any
stockholder has given proper notice to cumulate votes, all stockholders may cumulate their votes
for any candidates who have been properly placed in nomination. Under cumulative voting, the
candidates receiving the highest number of votes, up to the number of directors to be elected, are
elected.

(vi) During such time or times that the Company is subject to
Section 2115(b) of the CGCL, one or more directors may be removed from office at any time
without cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding
shares entitled to vote for that director as provided above; provided, however, that unless the
entire Board is removed, no individual director may be removed when the votes cast against such
director’s removal, or not consenting in writing to such removal, would be sufficient to elect that
director if voted cumulatively at an election which the same total number of votes were cast (or,
if such action is taken by written consent, all shares entitled to vote were voted) and the entire
number of directors authorized at the time of such director’s most recent election were then
being elected.

3. LIQUIDATION RIGHTS.

(a) Upon any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company,
whether voluntary or involuntary (a “Liquidation Event”), before any distribution or payment
shall be made to the holders of any Common Stock, the Company shall make payment to the
holders of Series Preferred as follows:

(i) The holders of Series C Preferred shall be entitled to be
paid out of the assets of the Company legally available for distribution for each share of Series C
Preferred held by them, an amount per share of Series C Preferred equal to the Original Issue

722669 v8/SD
Price of the Series C Preferred plus all declared and unpaid dividends on the Series C Preferred
(the “Series C Liquidation Preference”). If, upon any such Liquidation Event, the assets of the
Company shall be insufficient to make payment in full to all holders of Series C Preferred of the
Series C Liquidation Preference, then such assets (or consideration) shall be distributed among
the holders of Series C Preferred at the time outstanding, ratably in proportion to the full
amounts to which they would otherwise be respectively entitled pursuant to this Section 3(a)(i).

(ii) After payment in full of the Series C Liquidation
Preference, the holders of Series B Preferred, Series B-1 Preferred, Series B-2 Preferred and
Series A Preferred, on a pari passu basis and in preference to holders of Common Stock, shall be
entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Company legally available for distribution for each
share of Series B Preferred, Series B-1 Preferred, Series B-2 Preferred or Series A Preferred held
by them, an amount per share of Series B Preferred, Series B-1 Preferred, Series B-2 Preferred or
Series A Preferred equal to (i) with respect to the Series B Preferred, the Original Issue Price of
the Series B Preferred plus all declared and unpaid dividends on the Series B Preferred (the
“Series B Liquidation Preference”), (ii) with respect to the Series B-1 Preferred, the Original
Issue Price of the Series B-1 Preferred plus all declared and unpaid dividends on the Series B-1
Preferred (the “Series B-I Liquidation Preference”), (iii) with respect to the Series B-2
Preferred, the Original Issue Price of the Series B-2 Preferred plus all declared and unpaid
dividends on the Series B-2 Preferred (the “Series B-2 Liquidation Preferrence”) and (iv) with
respect to the Series A Preferred, the Original Issue Price of the Series A Preferred plus all
declared and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred (the “Series A Liquidation
Preference”, and together with the Series B Liquidation Preference, the Series B-1 Liquidation
Preference and the Series B-2 Liquidation Preference, the “Junior Preferred Liquidation
Preference”). \f, upon any such Liquidation Event and after payment in full of the Series C
Liquidation Preference, the assets of the Company shall be insufficient to make payment in full
to all holders of Series B Preferred, Series B-1 Preferred, Series B-2 Preferred and Series A
Preferred of the Junior Preferred Liquidation Preference, then such assets (or consideration) shall
be distributed among the holders of Series B Preferred, Series B-1 Preferred, Series B-2
Preferred and Series A Preferred at the time outstanding, ratably in proportion to the full amounts
to which they would otherwise be respectively entitled pursuant to this Section (3)(a)(ii).

(b) After payment in full of the Series C Liquidation Preference and
the Junior Preferred Liquidation Preference, the remaining assets of the Company legally
available for distribution, if any, shall be distributed ratably to the holders of the Common Stock.

(c) Shares of Series Preferred shall not be entitled to be converted into
shares of Common Stock in order to participate in any distribution, or series of distributions, as
shares of Common Stock, without first foregoing participation in the distribution, or series of
distributions, as shares of Series Preferred. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a
Liquidation Event, a holder of Series Preferred shall be entitled to receive, for each share of
Series Preferred then held, out of the proceeds of such Liquidation Event, the greater of the
amount of cash, securities or other property to which such holder would be entitled to receive in
a Liquidation Event pursuant to (i) Section 3(a) above or (ii) the amount of cash, securities or
other property to which such holder would be entitled to receive in a Liquidation Event with
respect to such shares if such shares had been converted to Common Stock immediately prior to
such Liquidation Event.

722669 v8/SD
4, ASSET TRANSFER OR ACQUISITION RIGHTS.

(a) In the event that the Company is a party to an Acquisition or Asset
Transfer, then each hoider of Series Preferred shall be entitled to receive, for each share of Series
Preferred then held, out of the proceeds of such Acquisition or Asset Transfer, the amount of
cash, securities or other property to which such holder would be entitled to receive in a
Liquidation Event pursuant to Section 3(a) above.

(b) For the purposes of this Section 4: (1) “Acquisition” shall mean
(A) any consolidation or merger of the Company with or into any other corporation or other
entity or person, or any other corporate reorganization, other than any such consolidation, merger
or reorganization in which the stockholders of the Company immediately prior to such
consolidation, merger or reorganization, continue to hold at least a majority of the voting power
of the surviving entity in substantially the same proportions (or, if the surviving entity is a
wholly owned subsidiary, its parent) immediately after such consolidation, merger or
reorganization; or (B) any transaction or series of related transactions to which the Company is a
party in which in excess of 50% of the Company’s voting power is transferred; provided that an
Acquisition shall not include any transaction or series of transactions principally for bona fide
equity financing purposes in which cash is received by the Company or any successor or
indebtedness of the Company is cancelled or converted or a combination thereof; and (ii) “Asset
Transfer” shall mean a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or the
exclusive license of substantially all of the rights to substantially all of the intellectual property
of the Company material to its business.

(c) In any Acquisition or Asset Transfer, if the consideration to be
received is securities of a corporation or other property other than cash, its value will be deemed
its fair market value as determined in good faith by the Board on the date such determination is
made.

5. CONVERSION RIGHTS.

The holders of the Series Preferred shall have the following rights with
respect to the conversion of the Series Preferred into shares of Common Stock (the “Conversion
Rights”):

(a) Optional Conversion. Subject to and in compliance with the
provisions of this Section 5, any shares of Series Preferred may, at the option of the holder, be
converted at any time into fully-paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock; provided,
however, that no shares of Series B Preferred shall be converted pursuant to this Section 5(a)
during the time period beginning on the Filing Date and ending on the date immediately
following the date of the Rights Offering Closing (as such term is defined in that certain Series C
Preferred Stock and Warrant Purchase Agreement, dated on or about the Filing Date, between
the Company and each of those persons and entities listed on Exhibit A thereto (the “Purchase
Agreement”)). The number of shares of Common Stock to which a holder of Series Preferred
shall be entitled upon conversion shall be the product obtained by multiplying the applicable
“Series Preferred Conversion Rate” then in effect (determined as provided in Section 5(b)) by the
number of shares of Series Preferred being converted.

722669 v8/SD
(b) Series Preferred Conversion Rate. The conversion rate in effect
at any time for the conversion of the Series Preferred (the “Series Preferred Conversion Rate”)
shall be the quotient obtained by dividing the applicable Original Issue Price of the Series
Preferred by the applicable “Series Preferred Conversion Price,” calculated as provided in
Section 5(c).

(c) Series Preferred Conversion Price. The conversion price for the
Series A Preferred shall initially be the Original Issue Price of the Series A Preferred; the
conversion price of the Series B Preferred shall initially be the Original Issue Price of the Series
B Preferred; the conversion price of the Series B-1 Preferred shall initially be the Original Issue
Price of the Series B-1 Preferred; the conversion price of the Series B-2 Preferred shall initially
be the Original Issue Price of the Series B-2 Preferred; and the conversion price of the Series C
Preferred shail initially be the Original Issue Price of the Series C Preferred (each such
conversion price, the “Series Preferred Conversion Price”). Such initial Series Preferred
Conversion Prices shall be adjusted from time to time in accordance with this Section 5. All
references to the Series Preferred Conversion Price herein shall mean the Series Preferred
Conversion Price as so adjusted.

(d) Mechanics of Conversion. Each holder of Series Preferred who
desires to convert the same into shares of Common Stock pursuant to this Section 5 shall
surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Company or
any transfer agent for the Series Preferred, and shall give written notice to the Company at such
office that such holder elects to convert the same. Such notice shall state the number of shares of
Series Preferred being converted. Thereupon, the Company shall promptly issue and deliver at
such office to such holder a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock
to which such holder is entitled and shall promptly pay (i) in cash or, to the extent sufficient
funds are not then legally available therefor, in Common Stock (at the Common Stock’s fair
market value determined by the Board as of the date of such conversion), any declared and
unpaid dividends on the shares of Series Preferred being converted and (ii) in cash (at the
Common Stock’s fair market value determined by the Board as of the date of conversion) the
value of any fractional share of Common Stock otherwise issuable to any holder of Series
Preferred. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made at the close of business on the
date of such surrender of the certificates representing the shares of Series Preferred to be
converted, and the person entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such
conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such shares of Common Stock
on such date.

(e) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If at any time
or from time to time on or after the Filing Date the Company effects a subdivision of the
outstanding Common Stock without a corresponding subdivision of the Series Preferred, the
Series Preferred Conversion Price for such series in effect immediately before that subdivision
shall be proportionately decreased. Conversely, if at any time or from time to time after the
Filing Date the Company combines the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller
number of shares without a corresponding combination of the Series Preferred, the Series
Preferred Conversion Price for such series in effect immediately before the combination shall be
proportionately increased. Any adjustment under this Section 5(e) shall become effective at the
close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective.

10.
722669 v8/SD
(f) Adjustment for Common Stock Dividends and Distributions.
If at any time or from time to time on or after the Filing Date the Company pays to holders of
Common Stock a dividend or other distribution in additional shares of Common Stock without a
corresponding dividend or other distribution to holders of Preferred Stock, the Series Preferred
Conversion Price for such series then in effect shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance,
as provided below:

(i) The Series Preferred Conversion Price for such series shall
be adjusted by multiplying the Series Preferred Conversion Price for such series then in effect by
a fraction equal to:

(A) _ the numerator of which is the total number of shares
of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance, and

(B) the denominator of which is the total number of
shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance
plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or
distribution;

(ii) If the Company fixes a record date to determine which
holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution, the Series
Preferred Conversion Price for each series of Series Preferred shall be fixed as of the close of
business on such record date and the number of shares of Common Stock shall be calculated
immediately prior to the close of business on such record date; and

(iii) If such record date is fixed and such dividend is not fully
paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the Series Preferred
Conversion Price for each series of Series Preferred shall be recomputed accordingly as of the
close of business on such record date and thereafter the Series Preferred Conversion Price for
each series of Series Preferred shall be adjusted pursuant to this Section 5(f) to reflect the actual
payment of such dividend or distribution.

(g) Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange, Substitution,
Reorganization, Merger or Consolidation. If at any time on or after the Filing Date the
Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of a series of the Series Preferred is changed into
the same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by
recapitalization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or otherwise (other than an Acquisition or
Asset Transfer as defined in Section 4 or a subdivision or combination of shares or stock
dividend provided for elsewhere in this Section 5), in any such event each holder of such series
of Series Preferred shall then have the right to convert such stock into the kind and amount of
stock and other securities and property receivable upon such recapitalization, reclassification,
merger, consolidation or other change by holders of the maximum number of shares of Common
Stock into which such shares of Series Preferred could have been converted immediately prior to
such recapitalization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or change, all subject to further
adjustment as provided herein or with respect to such other securities or property by the terms
thereof. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the
provisions of this Section 5 with respect to the rights of the holders of such series of Series

722669 v8/SD
Preferred after the capital reorganization to the end that the provisions of this Section 5
(including adjustment of the Series Preferred Conversion Price for such series of Series Preferred
then in effect and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of such series of Series
Preferred) shali be applicable after that event and be as nearly equivalent as practicable.

(h) Sale of Shares Below Series Preferred Conversion Price.

(i) If at any time or from time to time after the Filing Date, the
Company issues or sells, or is deemed by the express provisions of this Section 5(h) to have
issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock, other than as provided in Section 5(e), 5(f)
or 5(g) above, for an Effective Price less than the then-effective Series Preferred Conversion
Price for the Series C Preferred, Series B Preferred, Series B-1 Preferred and Series A Preferred
(a “Qualifying Dilutive Issuance”), then and in each such case, the then-existing Series
Preferred Conversion Price (other than the Conversion Price of the Series B-2 Preferred) for such
series of Series Preferred shall be reduced, as of the opening of business on the date of such issue
or sale, to a price determined by multiplying the Series Preferred Conversion Price for such
series in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale by a fraction equal to:

(A) _ the numerator of which shall be (A) the number of
shares of Common Stock deemed outstanding (as determined below) immediately prior to such
issue or sale, plus (B) the number of shares of Common Stock which the Aggregate
Consideration (as defined below) received or deemed received by the Company for the total
number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued would purchase at such then-existing
Series Preferred Conversion Price, and

(B) the denominator of which shall be the number of
shares of Common Stock deemed outstanding (as determined below) immediately prior to such
issue or sale plus the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued.

For the purposes of the preceding sentence, the number of shares of Common Stock
deemed to be outstanding as of a given date shall be the sum of (A) the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding, (B) the number of shares of Common Stock into which the then
outstanding shares of Series Preferred could be converted if fully converted on the day
immediately preceding the given date and (C) the number of shares of Common Stock which are
issuable upon the exercise or conversion of all other rights, options and convertible securities
outstanding on the day immediately preceding the given date.

(ii) | No adjustment shall be made to the Series Preferred
Conversion Price for any series of Series Preferred in an amount less than $0.01 per share. Any
adjustment required by this Section 5(h) shall be rounded to the nearest $0.01 per share. Any
adjustment otherwise required by this Section 5(h) that is not required to be made due to the
preceding two sentences shall be included in any subsequent adjustment to the Series Preferred
Conversion Price for such series of Series Preferred. Further, no adjustment shall be made to the
Series B-2 Preferred Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 5(h).

(iii) | For the purpose of making any adjustment required under

this Section 5(h), the aggregate consideration received by the Company for any issue or sale of

12.
722669 v8/SD
securities (the “Aggregate Consideration”) shall be defined as: (A) to the extent it consists of
cash, be computed at the gross amount of cash received by the Company before deduction of any
underwriting or similar commissions, compensation or concessions paid or allowed by the
Company in connection with such issue or sale and without deduction of any expenses payable
by the Company, (B) to the extent it consists of property other than cash, be computed at the fair
value of that property as determined in good faith by the Board, and (C) if Additional Shares of
Common Stock, Convertible Securities (as defined below) or rights or options to purchase either
Additional Shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities are issued or sold together with
other stock or securities or other assets of the Company for a consideration which covers both, be
computed as the portion of the consideration so received that may be reasonably determined in
good faith by the Board to be allocable to such Additional Shares of Common Stock, Convertible
Securities or rights or options.

(iv) For the purpose of the adjustment required under this
Section 5(h), if the Company issues or sells (x) Preferred Stock or other stock, options, warrants,
purchase rights or other securities convertible into, Additional Shares of Common Stock (such
convertible stock or securities being herein referred to as “Convertible Securities”) or (y) rights
or options for the purchase of Additional Shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities and
if the Effective Price of such Additional Shares of Common Stock is less than the Series
Preferred Conversion Price for the Series C Preferred, Series B Preferred, Series B-1 Preferred or
Series A Preferred, in each case the Company shall be deemed to have issued at the time of the
issuance of such rights or options or Convertible Securities the maximum number of Additional
Shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise or conversion thereof and to have received as
consideration for the issuance of such shares an amount equal to the total amount of the
consideration, if any, recetved by the Company for the issuance of such rights or options or
Convertible Securities plus:

(A) in the case of such rights or options, the minimum
amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon the exercise of such rights or
options; and

(B) _ in the case of Convertible Securities, the minimum
amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon the conversion thereof (other
than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities);
provided that if the minimum amounts of such consideration cannot be ascertained, but are a
function of antidilution or similar protective clauses, the Company shall be deemed to have
received the minimum amounts of consideration without reference to such clauses.

(C) If the minimum amount of consideration payable to
the Company upon the exercise or conversion of rights, options or Convertible Securities is
reduced over time or on the occurrence or non-occurrence of specified events other than by
reason of antidilution adjustments, the Effective Price shall be recalculated using the figure to
which such minimum amount of consideration is reduced; provided further, that if the minimum
amount of consideration payable to the Company upon the exercise or conversion of such rights,
options or Convertible Securities is subsequently increased, the Effective Price shall be again
recalculated using the increased minimum amount of consideration payable to the Company
upon the exercise or conversion of such rights, options or Convertible Securities.

13.
722669 v8/SD
(D) No further adjustment of the Series Preferred
Conversion Price for a series of Series Preferred, as adjusted upon the issuance of such rights,
options or Convertible Securities, shall be made as a result of the actual issuance of Additional
Shares of Common Stock or the exercise of any such rights or options or the conversion of any
such Convertible Securities. If any such rights or options or the conversion privilege represented
by any such Convertible Securities shall expire without having been exercised, the Series
Preferred Conversion Price for such series as adjusted upon the issuance of such rights, options
or Convertible Securities shall be readjusted to the Series Preferred Conversion Price for such
series which would have been in effect had an adjustment been made on the basis that the only
Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued were the Additional Shares of Common Stock, if
any, actually issued or sold on the exercise of such rights or options or rights of conversion of
such Convertible Securities, and such Additional Shares of Common Stock, if any, were issued
or sold for the consideration actually received by the Company upon such exercise, plus the
consideration, if any, actually received by the Company for the granting of all such rights or
options, whether or not exercised, plus the consideration received for issuing or selling the
Convertible Securities actually converted, plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the
Company (other than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible
Securities) on the conversion of such Convertible Securities, provided that such readjustment
shall not apply to prior conversions of Series Preferred.

(v) For the purpose of making any adjustment to the
Conversion Price of the Series Preferred required under this Section 5(h), “Additional Shares of
Common Stock” shall mean all shares of Common Stock issued by the Company or deemed to
be issued pursuant to this Section 5(h) (including shares of Common Stock subsequently
reacquired or retired by the Company), other than:

(A) shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of
the Series Preferred;

(B) shares of Series B-1 Preferred and Series B-2
Preferred issued upon conversion of shares of Series B Preferred pursuant to the Special
Mandatory Conversion (as defined below);

(C) — shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities
issued after the Filing Date to employees, officers or directors of, or consultants or advisors to,
the Company or any subsidiary pursuant to stock purchase or stock option plans or other
arrangements that are approved by the Board;

(D) shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to the
exercise of Convertible Securities outstanding as of the Filing Date;

(E) shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities
issued for consideration other than cash pursuant to a merger, consolidation, acquisition,
strategic alliance or similar business combination; provided that the issuance of shares therein
has been approved by the Board;

722669 v8/SD
(F) — shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities
issued pursuant to any equipment loan or leasing arrangement, real property leasing arrangement
or debt financing from a bank or similar financial institution; provided that the issuance of shares
therein has been approved by the Board;

(G) — shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities
issued to third-party service providers in exchange for or as partial consideration for services
rendered to the Company; provided that the issuance of shares therein has been approved by the
Board; and

(H) any Common Stock or Convertible Securities issued
in connection with strategic transactions involving the Company and other entities, including,
without limitation, (i) joint ventures, manufacturing, marketing or distribution arrangements or
(ii) technology transfer or development arrangements; provided that the issuance of shares
therein has been approved by the Board;

provided, however, that the total number of shares excluded from the definition of Additional
Shares of Common Stock pursuant to subsections (E), (F), (G) and (H) above shall not exceed
3,000,000 shares in the aggregate (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits,
recapitalizations and the like with respect to such shares after the Filing Date).

References to Common Stock in the subsections of this clause (v) above shall
mean all shares of Common Stock issued by the Company or deemed to be issued pursuant to
this Section 5(h). The “Effective Price” of Additional Shares of Common Stock shall mean the
quotient determined by dividing the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock issued
or sold, or deemed to have been issued or sold by the Company under this Section 5(h), into the
Aggregate Consideration received, or deemed to have been received by the Company for such
issue under this Section 5(h), for such Additional Shares of Common Stock. In the event that the
number of shares of Additional Shares of Common Stock or the Effective Price cannot be
ascertained at the time of issuance (other than by virtue of antidilution provisions contained
therein that have not yet been invoked), such Additional Shares of Common Stock shall be
deemed issued immediately upon the occurrence of the first event that makes such number of
shares or the Effective Price, as applicable, ascertainable.

(vi) In the event that the Company issues or sells, or is deemed
to have issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock in a Qualifying Dilutive Issuance
(the “First Dilutive Issuance”), then in the event that the Company issues or sells, or is deemed
to have issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock in a Qualifying Dilutive Issuance
other than the First Dilutive Issuance as a part of the same transaction or series of related
transactions as the First Dilutive Issuance (a “Subsequent Dilutive Issuance”), then and in each
such case upon a Subsequent Dilutive Issuance the Conversion Price (other than the Conversion
Price of the Series B-2 Preferred) shall be reduced to the Conversion Price that would have been
in effect had the First Dilutive Issuance and each Subsequent Dilutive Issuance all occurred on
the closing date of the First Dilutive Issuance. Qualifying Dilutive Issuances occurring within
three months of each other shall be deemed to be part of the same transaction for the purposes of
this subsection (vi).

722669 v8/SD
(i) Certificate of Adjustment. In each case of an adjustment or
readjustment of the Series Preferred Conversion Price for the number of shares of Common
Stock or other securities issuable upon conversion of the Series Preferred, if such series of Series
Preferred is then convertible pursuant to this Section 5, the Company, at its expense, shall
compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the provisions hereof and shall,
upon request, prepare a certificate showing such adjustment or readjustment, and shall mail such
certificate, by first class mail, postage prepaid, to each registered holder of such Series Preferred
so requesting at the holder’s address as shown in the Company’s books. The certificate shall set
forth such adjustment or readjustment, showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or
readjustment is based, including a statement of (i) the consideration received or deemed to be
received by the Company for any Additional Shares of Common Stock issued or sold or deemed
to have been issued or sold, (ii) the Series Preferred Conversion Price for such series at the time
in effect, (iii) the number of Additional Shares of Common Stock and (iv) the type and amount,
if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon conversion of such series of
Series Preferred. Failure to request or provide such notice shall have no effect on any such
adjustment.

(j) Notices of Record Date. Upon (i) any taking by the Company of
a record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders
thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend or other distribution, or (ii) any Acquisition (as
defined in Section 4) or other capital reorganization of the Company, any reclassification or
recapitalization of the capital stock of the Company, any merger or consolidation of the
Company with or into any other corporation, or any Asset Transfer (as defined in Section 4), or
any voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company, the
Company shall mail to each holder of Series Preferred at least 10 days prior to (a) the record
date, if any, specified therein; or (b) if no record date is specified, the date upon which such
action is to take effect (or, in either case, such shorter period approved by the holders of a
majority of the outstanding Series Preferred) a notice specifying (A) the date on which any such
record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend or distribution and a description of such
dividend or distribution, (B)the date on which any such Acquisition, reorganization,
reclassification, transfer, consolidation, merger, Asset Transfer, dissolution, liquidation or
winding up is expected to become effective, and (C) the date, if any, that is to be fixed as to
when the holders of record of Common Stock (or other securities) shall be entitled to exchange
their shares of Common Stock (or other securities) for securities or other property deliverable
upon such Acquisition, reorganization, reclassification, transfer, consolidation, merger, Asset
Transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up.

(k) Automatic Conversion.

(i) Each share of Series Preferred shall automatically be
converted into shares of Common Stock, based on the then-effective Series Preferred Conversion
Price for the applicable series, (A) at any time upon the affirmative election of the holders of at
least a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series Preferred, voting together as a single class
on an as-if-converted basis; provided, however, that no shares of Series Preferred shall be
converted pursuant to this Section 5(k)(i)(A) during the time period beginning on the Filing Date
and ending on the date immediately following the date of the Rights Offering Closing, or (B)
immediately upon the closing of a firmly underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective

16.
722669 v8/SD
registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, covering the offer and sale
of Common Stock for the account of the Company in which (i) the per share price is at least two
and one half times (2.5x) the Original Issue Price of the Series C Preferred, (as adjusted for stock
splits, dividends, recapitalizations and the like after the Filing Date) and (ii) the gross cash
proceeds to the Company (before underwriting discounts, commissions and fees) are at least
$30,000,000 (a “Qualified IPO”). Upon such automatic conversion, any declared and unpaid
dividends shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of Section 5(d).

(ii) | Upon the occurrence of either of the events specified in
Section 5(k)(i) above, the outstanding shares of Series Preferred shall be converted automatically
without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates
representing such shares are surrendered to the Company or its transfer agent; provided,
however, that the Company shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion unless the certificates evidencing such shares of
Series Preferred are either delivered to the Company or its transfer agent as provided below, or
the holder notifies the Company or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen
or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Company to indemnify the Company
from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates. Upon the occurrence of such
automatic conversion of the Series Preferred, the holders of Series Preferred shall surrender the
certificates representing such shares at the office of the Company or any transfer agent for the
Series Preferred. Thereupon, there shall be issued and delivered to such holder promptly at such
office and in its name as shown on such surrendered certificate or certificates, a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Series Preferred
surrendered were convertible on the date on which such automatic conversion occurred, and any
declared and unpaid dividends shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of Section 5(d).

(I) Special Mandatory Conversion.
(i) Definitions.

(A) Each of the following terms shall have the meaning
ascribed to it in the Purchase Agreement: “Advance Closing,” “Adjusted Major Investor Pro
Rata Amount,” “Eligible Stockholder,” “Major Investor,” “Pro Rata Amount,” “Rights
Offering Closing,” “Rights Offering Closing Date,” “Shares” and “Undersubscribing Major
Investor.”

(B} ‘“Nonparticipation Percentage” shall equal:

(1) As applied to Major Investors: i) if the
Major Investor purchased at least its Pro Rata Amount in the Advance Closing, the ratio of (x)
the aggregate number of Shares of such Major Investor’s Adjusted Major Investor Pro Rata
Amount that such Major Investor fails to purchase in the Advance Closing and Rights Offering
Closing (treated together as one closing) to (y) the total amount of such Major Investor’s
Adjusted Major Investor Pro Rata Amount; or ii) if the Major Investor did not purchase at least
its Pro Rata Amount in the Advance Closing, the ratio of (x) the aggregate number of Shares of
such Major Investor’s Adjusted Major Investor Pro Rata Amount (calculated as if all Major
Investors purchased their Pro Rata Amount in the Advance Closing) that such Major Investor

17.
722669 v8/SD
fails to purchase in the Advance Closing and Rights Offering Closing (treated together as one
closing) to (y) the total amount of such Major Investor’s Adjusted Major Investor Pro Rata
Amount (calculated as if all Major Investors purchased their Pro Rata Amount in the Advance
Closing); and

(2) As applied to Eligible Stockholders that are
not Major Investors, the ratio of (x) the aggregate number of Shares of such Eligible
Stockholder’s Pro Rata Amount that such Eligible Stockholder fails to purchase in the Advance
Closing and Rights Offering Closing (treated together as one closing) to (y) the total amount of
such Eligible Stockholder’s Pro Rata Amount.

(C) “Mandatory Conversion Stock” shall mean (1) if
the Undersubscribing Eligible Stockholder purchases a number of Shares that is equal to or
greater than 50% of such Undersubscribing Eligible Stockholder’s Pro Rata Amount in the
Advance Closing and Rights Offering Closing (treated together as one closing), Series B-1
Preferred; and (2) if the Undersubscribing Eligible Stockholder purchases a number of Shares
that is less than 50% of such Undersubscribing Eligible Stockholder’s Pro Rata Amount in the
Advance Closing and Rights Offering Closing (treated together as one closing), Series B-2
Preferred.

(D) “Undersubscribing Eligible Stockholder” shall
mean (1) any Undersubscribing Major Investor and (2) any Eligible Stockholder that purchases
less than its Pro Rata Amount in the Advance Closing and Rights Offering Closing (treated
together as one closing).

(ii) In the event that any holder of shares of Series B Preferred
is an Undersubscribing Eligible Stockholder, then, notwithstanding any other provision herein,
that number of shares of Series B Preferred held by such Undersubscribing Major Investor as of
immediately prior to the Rights Offering Closing Date that is equal to (x) such Undersubscribing
Eligible Stockholder’s Nonparticipation Percentage multiplied by (y) the total number of shares
of Series B Preferred held by such Undersubscribing Eligible Stockholder as of immediately
prior to the Rights Offering Closing, rounded to the nearest whole share, shall automatically, and
without any further action on the part of such Undersubscribing Eligible Stockholder or any
other person or entity and whether or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered
to the Company or its transfer agent, be converted into 1/2.637 of a share of Mandatory
Conversion Stock for each one share of Series B Preferred so converted, effective immediately
prior to the Rights Offering Closing and whether or not the certificates representing such shares
are surrendered to the Company or its transfer agent, rounded to the nearest whole share. Such
conversion is referred to herein as a “Special Mandatory Conversion.”

(iii) In the event that any holder of Series B Preferred (a
“Transferor”) sells or otherwise transfers any shares of Series B Preferred to a third party
following the Filing Date and prior to the Special Mandatory Conversion, the automatic
conversion of Series B Preferred to Series B-1 Preferred or Series B-2 Preferred, as applicable,
described herein shall apply to such transferred shares of Series B Preferred as if such sale or
transfer had not occurred and such shares continued to be held by the Transferor as of the Special
Mandatory Conversion. Upon a Special Mandatory Conversion, all rights of the holder of such

18.
722669 v8/SD
shares as a holder of shares of Series B Preferred shall immediately cease and terminate with
respect to the shares of Series B Preferred so converted. Upon the occurrence of such Special
Mandatory Conversion, the affected holders of shares of Series B Preferred shall surrender the
certificates representing such shares at the office of the Company or any transfer agent for the
Series Preferred. Thereupon, there shall be issued and delivered to such holder promptly at such
office and in its name as shown on such surrendered certificate or certificates, a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Series B-1 Preferred or Series B-2 Preferred, as
applicable, into which the shares of Series B Preferred surrendered were converted as a result of
the Special Mandatory Conversion.

(m) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall
be issued upon conversion of Series Preferred. Al! shares of Common Stock (including fractions
thereof) issuable upon conversion of more than one share of Series Preferred by a holder thereof
shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the conversion would result in the
issuance of any fractional share. If, after the aforementioned aggregation, the conversion would
result in the issuance of any fractional share, the Company shall, in lieu of issuing any fractional
share, pay cash equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by the fair market value of one
share of Common Stock (as determined by the Board) on the date of conversion.

(n) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Company
shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common
Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Series Preferred,
such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all outstanding shares of the Series Preferred. If at any time the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all then outstanding shares of the Series Preferred, the Company will take such corporate
action as may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to
such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.

(0) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Section 5
shall be in writing and shall be deemed effectively given: (i) upon personal delivery to the party
to be notified, (ii) when sent by confirmed electronic mail or facsimile if sent during normal
business hours of the recipient; if not, then on the next business day, (iii) five days after having
been sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid or (iv) one day
after deposit with a nationally recognized overnight courier, specifying next day delivery, with
verification of receipt. All notices shall be addressed to each holder of record at the address of
such holder appearing on the books of the Company.

(p) Payment of Taxes. The Company will pay all taxes (other than
taxes based upon income) and other governmental charges that may be imposed with respect to
the issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of shares of Series Preferred,
excluding any tax or other charge imposed in connection with any transfer involved in the issue
and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in which the shares of Series
Preferred so converted were registered.

722669 v8/SD
6. No REISSUANCE OF SERIES PREFERRED.

No shares or shares of Series Preferred acquired by the Company by reason of
redemption, purchase, conversion or otherwise shall be reissued.

V.

A. To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL as the same exists or as may
hereafter be amended, a director of the Company shall not be personally liable to the Company
or its stockholders for monetary damages for a breach of fiduciary duty as a director.

B. The Company may indemnify to the fullest extent permitted by law any person
made or threatened to be made a party to an action or proceeding, whether criminal, civil,
administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he, his testator or intestate is or was a
director, officer or employee of the Company or any predecessor of the Company or serves or
served at any other enterprise as a director, officer or employee at the request of the Company or
any predecessor to the Company.

Cc. The Company is authorized to provide indemnification of agents (as defined in
Section 317 of the CGCL) for breach of duty to the Company and its stockholders through bylaw
provisions or through agreements with the agents, or through stockholder resolutions, or
otherwise, in excess of the indemnification otherwise permitted by Section 317 of the CGCL,
subject, at any time or times that the Company is subject to Section 2115(b) of the CGCL, to the
limits on such excess indemnification set forth in Section 204 of the CGCL.

D. Any repeal or modification of this Article V shall only be prospective and shail
not affect the rights under this Article V in effect at the time of the alleged occurrence of any
action or omission to act giving rise to liability.

E. In the event that a member of the Board who is also a partner or employee of an
entity that is a holder of Preferred Stock and that is in the business of investing and reinvesting in
other entities, or an employee of an entity that manages such an entity (each, a “Fund”) acquires
knowledge of a potential transaction or other matter in such individual’s capacity as a partner or
employee of the Fund or the manager or general partner of the Fund (and other than directly in
connection with such individual’s service as a member of the Board) and that may be an
opportunity of interest for both the Company and such Fund (a “Corporate Opportunity’), then
the Company (i) renounces any expectancy that such director or Fund offer an opportunity to
participate in such Corporate Opportunity to the Company and (ii) to the fullest extent permitted
by law, waives any claim that such opportunity constituted a Corporate Opportunity that should
have been presented by such director or Fund to the Company or any of its affiliates; provided,
however, that such director acts in good faith.

VI.

For the management of the business and for the conduct of the affairs of the Company,
and in further definition, limitation and regulation of the powers of the Company, of its directors
and of its stockholders or any class thereof, as the case may be, it is further provided that:

which may be set forth in this Restated Certificate.

B. The Board is expressly empowered to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the
Company. The stockholders shall also have the power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of
the Company; provided however, that, in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series
of stock of the Company required by law or by this Certificate of Incorporation, the affirmative
vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares
of the capital stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting
together as a single class, shall be required to adopt, amend or repeal any provision of the
Bylaws of the Company.

C. The directors of the Company need not be elected by written ballot unless the
Bylaws so provide.
