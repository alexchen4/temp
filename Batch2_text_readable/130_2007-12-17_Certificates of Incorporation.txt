the name Acorn Acquisition, Inc. pursuant to the General Corporation Law.

duly adopted resolutions proposing to amend and restate the Fourth Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation declaring such amendment and

Corporation and its stockholders, and authorizing the appropriate officers of this
Corporation to solicit the consent of the stockbolders therefor, which resofution setting

RESOLVED, that the Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the
Corporation be amended and restated in its entirety as follows:

ARTICLE 1, NAME
The name of the corporation is ‘““Acom Cardiovascular, Inc.” (the “Corporstion”).

ARTICLE 2, REGISTERED OFFICE AND AGENT

The address of the registered office of the Corporation is c/o Corporation Service
Company, 2711 Centerville Road, Suite 400, Wilmington, Delaware 19808, County of New
Castle, and the name of its registered agent is Corporation Service Company.

ARTICLE 3. AUTHORIZED SHARES

3.1. Designation and Number. The aggregate number of authorized shares of the
Corporation is 85,800,000 shares, $.01 par value, of which 33,000,000 shares shall be designated
Series X Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series X Prefezred Stock”), 7,300,000 shares shall be
designated Series AA Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series AA Preferred Stock” and,
together with the Series X Preferred Stock, the “Preferred Stock”) and 45,500,000 shares shall be
designated Common Stock. Unless otherwise designated in this amended and restated certificate
by the Board of Directors, all issued shares shall be deemed to be Common Stock with equal
rights and preferences. The rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to and

4828-6632-4481\12
imposed upon the Common Stock, the Series X Preferred Stock and the Series AA Preferred
Stock are set forth in this Restated Certificate.

Prior to the filing of the Restated Certificate, the Corporation previously authorized,
issued and had outstanding six different classes of Preferred Stock: Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock, Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, Series C Convertible Preferred Stock,
Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, Series E Convertible Preferred Stock and Series F
Convertible Preferred Stock (collectively, the “Qld Preferred Stock’). Upon the effective date of
this Restated Certificate, each one (1) share of Old Preferred Stock (other than the Series E
Convertible Preferred Stock) shall be converted into one (1) share of Common Stock and each
six (6) shares of Series E Convertible Preferred Stock shall be converted into five (5) shares of
Common Stock (all such converted stock referred to as the “Recapitalized Stock’) and the Old
Preferred Stock shall be eliminated (the “Recapitalization”). Such shares of Common Stock
shall be deemed to be issued and outstanding for all purposes as of the date of such
Recapitalization, and the stock certificates representing shares of the Old Preferred Stock issued
and outstanding as of the effective time of the Recapitalization shall thereafter, automatically and
without the necessity of presenting the same for exchange, represent the mumber of shares of
Common Stock into which such shares have been converted. No fractional shares will be issued
in connection with the Recapitalization. In lieu of issuing any fractional shares, the number of
shares issued to any holder of shares of Recapitalized Stock who otherwise would be entitled to a
fractional share shal] be rounded up to the nearest whole number of shares of the Corporation’s
Common Stock.

Upon the effective date of this Restated Certificate and immediately after the
Recapitalization, each 64 shares of the Corporation’s Common Stock issued and outstanding,
including the Recapitalized Stock, shall automatically be combined, reclassified and changed
into one share of the Corporation’s Common Stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”). No fractional
shares will be issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. After aggregating all shares
issued to any stockholder in connection with the Reverse Stock Split, any stockholder who
would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share as a result of the Reverse Stock Split
shall receive in lieu of such fractional share, cash in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied
by the fair market value of the Common Stock at the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split as
determined by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. Stock certificates representing shares
of the Company’s Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the effective time of the Reverse
Stock Split shall thereafter, antomatically and without the necessity of presenting the same for
exchange, represent the number of shares (rounded down to the nearest whole share) obtained by
dividing the number of shares of Common Stock represented by such certificates prior to the
effective time of the Reverse Stock Split by 64.

3.2, Dividends. Following the date of the issuance of any shares of Preferred Stock
and so Jong as any shares of Preferred Stock are outstanding, dividends at a rate per annum of
$0.08 per share shall accrue on such shares of Preferred Stock (subject to sppropriate adjustment
in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization with
respect to the Preferred Stock) (the “Accruing Dividends”). Accruing Dividends shall accrue
from day to day, whether or not declared, and shall be cumulative; provided, however, that such

2
Accruing Dividends shall be payable only upon the earliest to occur of (i) when, as and if
declared by the Board of Directors, (ii) a mandatory redemption pursuant to Section 3.4 and (iii)
8 Liquidation Event. The Corporation shall not declare, pay or set aside any dividends on shares
of any other class or series of capital stock of the Corporation unless (in addition to the obtaining
of any consents required elsewhere in the Restated Certificate) the holders of the Preferred Stock
then outstanding ahall first receive, or simultaneously receive, a dividend on each outstanding
share of Preferred Stock in an amount at least equal to the amount of the aggregate Accmuing
Dividends then accrued on such share of Preferred Stock and not previously paid. All dividends
paid with respect to shares of the Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 3.2 shall be declared
and paid pro rata (except as set forth in Section 3.3) based upon the amount of Accruing
Dividends then due with respect to each share to all the holders of the shares of Preferred Stock
outstanding as of the applicable record date.

(a) Liquidation Preference. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of
the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary (each such event, a “Liguidation”):

(i) Series X Preference. The holders of Series X Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to receive out of the assets of the Corporation, prior and in preference to any
distribution of any of the assets of the Corporation to the holders of Series AA Preferred
Stock or the Common Stock, an amount per share (the “Series X Liquidation Amount”)
equal to (A) $1.00 per share (the “Original Issue Price’) of Series X Preferred Stock (as
adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, recapitalizations and the like)
multiplied by 1.5, plus (B) any Accruing Dividends accrued but unpaid thereon, whether
or not declared, together with any other dividends declared but unpaid thereon; provided.
however, that if the assets of the Corporation are insufficient to pay the aggregate Series
X Liquidation Amount to all holders of Series X Preferred Stock, the holders of such
shares shall share pro rata in any such distribution in proportion to the full amounts to
which they would otherwise be entitled.

(i) Series AA Preference. After payment of the aggregate Series X
Liquidation Amount to the holders of Series X Preferred Stock pursuant to Section
3.3(a)(i) and prior and in preference to any distribution of any of the assets of the
Corporation to the holders of the Common Stock, the holders of Series AA Preferred
Stock shall be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Corporation an amount per share
(the “Series AA Liquidation Amount” and, together with the Series X Liquidation
Amount, the “Preferred Liquidation Amount”) equal to the Original Issue Price per share
of Series AA Preferred Stock (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, combinations,
recapitalizations and the like), plus any Accruing Dividends accrued but unpaid thereon,
whether or not declared, together with any other dividends declared but unpaid thereon;
provided, however, that if the assets of the Corporation are insufficient to pay the Series
AA Liquidation Amount to all holders of Series AA Preferred Stock, the holders of such
shares shall share pro rata in any such distribution in proportion to the full amounts to
which they would otherwise be entitled.

3
(iii) . After the payment of the Preferred Liquidation Amount, the
holders of Preferred Stock shall share with the holders of Common Stock in the
remaining assets on a pro rata basis and on an as-if-converted basis.

(b) . A (i) consolidation, merger with any other entity (other
than a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation) or any transaction or series of related
transactions in which the Corporation is not the surviving person, (ii) transaction or series of
related transactions in which more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting power of the
Corporation is disposed of by the Corporation or its stockholders to a single person or group of
affiliated persons, or (iii) transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which the
Corporation sells, pledges, licenses or otherwise transfers all or substantially all of the assets of
the Corporation to a third party (each, a “Deemed Liquidation”) shall be deemed to be a
liquidation of the Corporation.

(c) Value of Consideration. In the event of a Deemed Liquidation, if the
consideration received by the Corporation is other than cash, its value will be deemed to be its
fair market value as follows:

¢}) No Restrictions. Securities not subject to an investment letter or other
similar restrictions on free marketability covered by Section 3.3(c)ii) below:

(A) If traded on a securities exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market, the
value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on
such exchange or system over the thirty (30) calendar day period ending three (3)
days prior to the closing;

(B) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be deemed to be
the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the
thirty (30) calendar day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing; and

(C) If there is no active public market, the value shall be the fair
market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation and the holders of at least 66-2/3% of all the then-outstanding shares
of Series X Preferred Stock.

Gi) Restrictions. The method of valuation of securities subject to an
investment letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising
solely by virtue of a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to
make an appropriate discount from the market valus determined as above in Section
3.3(c){i) to reflect the approximate fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by
the Board of Directors of the Corporation and the holders of at least 66-2/3% of all the
then-outstanding shares of Series X Preferred Stock.

(qd) Compliance. In the event the requirements of Sections 3.3(b) and 3.3(c) are not
complied with, the Corporation shall forthwith either:

4
(i) cause the closing of the Deemed Liquidation to be postponed until such
time as the requirements of Sections 3.3(b) and (c) have been complied with; or

(ii) cancel the Deemed Liquidation, in which event the rights, preferences and
privileges of the holders of the Preferred Stock shall revert to and be the same as such
rights, preferences and privileges existing immediately prior to the date of the first notice
referred to in Section 3.3(e) hereof.

(e) Notice. The Corporation shall give each holder of record of Preferred Stock
written notice of such impending Deemed Liquidation no later than twenty (20) days prior to the
stockholders’ meeting called to approve such Deemed Liquidation, or thirty (30) days prior to
the closing of such Deemed Liquidation, whichever is earlier, and shall also notify such holders
in writing of the final approval of such Deemed Liquidation. The first of such notices shall
describe the material terms and conditions of the impending Deemed Liquidation and the
provisions of this Section 3.3, and the Corporation shall thereafter give such holders prompt
notice of any material changes. The Deemed Liquidation shall in no event take place sooner
than thirty (30) days after the Corporation has given the first notice provided for herein or sooner
than ten (10) days after the Corporation has given notice of any material changes provided for
herein; provided, however, that such periods may be shortened upon the written consent of the
holders of Series X Preferred Stock that are entitled to such notice of rights or similar notice
rights and that represent at least 66-2/3% of all the then-outstanding shares of Series X Preferred
Stock, but not to the extent of having the effect of depriving any holder of Preferred Stock actual
notice of the impending Deemed Liquidation to the extent that such holder is actually prejudiced
a8 @ consequence,

3.4. Redemption

(8) Redemption Right. Shares of the Series X Preferred Stock shall be redeemed by
the Corporation out of funds lawfully available therefor at a price equal to the Original Issue
Price per share, plus any Accruing Dividends accrued but unpaid thereon, whether or not
declared, together with any other dividends declared but unpaid thereon (the “Redemption
Price”), in three equal annual installments (each payment date being referred to herein as a
“Redemption Date’’) commencing not more than ninety (90) days after the receipt by the
Corporation at any time on or after December 14, 2012 of a written request from the holders of
not less than 66-2/3% of the then-outstanding Series X Preferred Stock. On each Redemption
Date, the Corporation shall redeem, on a pro rata basis in accordance with the number of shares
of Series X Preferred Stock owned by each holder, that number of outstanding shares of Series X
Preferred Stock determined by dividing (i) the total number of shares of Series X Preferred Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such Redemption Date by (ii) the number of remaining
Redemption Dates (including the Redemption Date to which such calculation applies).

(b) At least fifteen (15), but no more than thirty (30), days prior to each Redemption
Date, written notice shall be mailed, first class postage prepaid, to each holder of record (at the
close of business on the business day preceding the day on which notice is given) of the Series X
Preferred Stock to be redeemed, at the address last shown on the records of the Corporation for

5
such holder, notifying such holder of the redemption to be effected on the applicable Redemption
Date, specifying the number of shares to be redeemed from such holder, the Redemption Date,
the Redemption Price, the place at which payment may be obtained and calling upon such holder
to surrender to the Corporation, in the manner and at the place designated, his, her or its
certificate or certificates representing the shares to be redeemed (the “Redemption Notice”).
Except as provided in Section 3.4(c), on or after each Redemption Date, each holder of Series X
Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such Redemption Date shall surrender to the Corporation the
certificate or certificates representing such shares, in the manner and at the place designated in
the Redemption Notice, and thereupon the applicable Redemption Price of such shares shall be
payable to the order of the person whoss name appears on such certificate or certificates as the
owner thereof and each surrendered certificate shall be canceled. In the event that less than all of
the shares represented by any such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued
representing the unredeemed shares.

(c) Consequences. From and after each Redemption Date, unless there shall have
been a default in payment of the Redemption Price, all rights of the holders of shares of Series X
Preferred Stock designated for redemption on such Redemption Date in the Redemption Notice
as holders of such Series X Preferred Stock (except the right to receive the applicable
Redemption Price without interest upon surrender of their certificate or certificates) shall cease
with respect to such shares, and such shares shall not thereafter be transferred on the books of the
Corporation or be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose whatsoever. If the funds of the
Corporation legally available for redemption of shares of Series X Preferred Stock on a
Redemption Date are insufficient to redeem the total number of shares of Series X Preferred
Stock to be redeemed on such date, those funds that are legally available will be used to redeem
the maximum possible number of such shares to be redeemed on such date, the Corporation shall
redeem a pro rata portion of each holder’s redeemable shares of such capital stock out of funds
legally available therefor, based on the respective amounts which would otherwise be payable in
respect of the shares to be redeemed if the legally available funds were sufficient to redeem all
such shares, and shall redeem the remaining shares to have been redeemed as soon as practicable
after the Corporation has funds legally available therefor. The shares of Series X Preferred Stock
not redeemed shall remain outstanding and entitled to all the rights and preferences provided
herein.

3.5. Voting Rights. The holders of record of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to notice
of and to attend all meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation, and each holder shall be
entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of shares of Common Stock into which the
shares of Preferred Stock held by such holder are convertible as of the record date for
determining the stockholders entitled to vote. Except as otherwise provided in this Restated
Certificate, or as required under the General Corporation Law, the holders of Preferred Stock and
Common Stock shall vote together as a single class.

(a) —_ So long as at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the originally issued shares of
Series X Preferred Stock, in the aggregate, are outstanding, then
6
(i) without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least 66-2/3%
of the shares of the then-outstanding shares of Series X Preferred Stock, voting or

a manner that adversely affects the rights, privileges or preferences of the Series

(E) redeem or repurchase any Common Stock without the approval of
the Board of Directors, which approval must inchide the affirmative vote of three
of the directors on the Board of Directors elected or appointed by the holders of
the Series X Preferred Stock (the “Series X Directors”); provided, however, that
this restriction shall not apply to the repurchase of shares of Common Stock at
their original cost from employees, officers, directors, consultants or other
persons performing services for the Corporation or any subsidiary pursuant to
agreements under which the Corporation has the option to repurchase such shares
upon the occurrence of certain events, such as the termination of employment or
the proposed assignment, conveyance or transfer of Common Stock received by
employees or other eligible participant under any Corporation option or other
incentive plan;

(F) _ take any action that authorizes or is intended to result in a
Liquidation (other than a Deemed Liquidation);

(G) authorize the recapitalization or reclassification of the issued and

recapitalization or otherwise;

(H) declare or pay any dividend or make any other distribution on any
shares of capital stock of the Corporation, at any time created and issued, other
than to effect a stock split;

6) increase the authorized number of directors constituting the Board
of Directors; or
(J) __ effect any transaction or series of transactions constituting a
Deemed Liquidation.

(ii) without the affirmative approval of a majority of the members of the

the Corporation following such action would exceed $1,000,000;

(B) authorize any capital expenditures in excess of $1,000,000;

(C) authorize the creation of, or an increase in the number of shares to
be issued pursuant to, any stock option plan;

(D) authorize any acquisition or license transaction with a value in
excess of $1,000,000; or

authorize any pledge of assets or sale of assets with a value in
excess of $1,000,000.

originally issued shares of Series AA Preferred Stock, in the aggregate, are outstanding, without
the affirmative vote or consent of at least a majority of the ahares of the then-outstanding shares
of Series AA Preferred Stock, voting or consenting together as a single class, the Corporation
shall not:

(i) amend the Restated Certificate or the Bylaws of the Corporation in a
manner that adversely affects the rights, privileges or preferences of the Series AA
Preferred Stock in a manner materially different from that of the Series X Preferred
Stock;

(ii) take any action which would adversely alter or change any of the rights,
preferences or privileges of the Series AA Preferred Stock, whether by merger,
consolidation, recapitalization or otherwise, in a manner materially different from that of
the Series X Preferred Stock;

(iii) authorize, issue or create any new class or series of capital stock, or
securitics exercisable or convertible into equity securities, having preferences or
privileges that are both (A) senior to or on parity with the Series AA Preferred Stock and

(iv) increase the number of authorized shares of Series AA Preferred Stock.

3.7. Mandatory Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock outstanding shall
automatically be converted into Common Stock at the then-applicable Conversion Price upon

8
either (i) the date specified by the election of at least 66-2/3% of the then outstanding shares of
Series X Preferred Stock, or (ii) the closing of a firm commitment underwritten public offering
pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (or any successor form) by the Corporation of
its Common Stock in which (A) the aggregate gross proceeds to the Corporation are at least
$70,000,000 and imply a post-offering value of the Company’s issued and outstanding capital
stock of at least $200,000,000 and (B) the public offering price is not less than $4.00 per share
(as adjusted from time to time upon the occurrence of any subdivisions, stock-splits,
recapitalizations, combinations, stock dividends or changes of Common Stock into a different
number of shares of the same or any other class or classes of shares). The Corporation shall give
notice to the holders of Preferred Stock of such automatic conversion and may require the
surrender of certificates representing such shares before delivering certificates representing the
Common Stock issued in such conversion.

3.8. Special Mandatory Conversion.

(a) Trigger Event. In the event that any holder of the outstanding shares of Series X
Preferred Stock (a “Series X Holder”) does not participate in a Qualified Financing by
purchasing in such Qualified Financing, and within the time period specified by the Corporation
(provided that the Corporation has given each Series X Holder at least 10 days’ prior written
notice of, and the opportunity to purchase its Pro Rata Amount), such Series X Holder’s Pro Rata
Amount, then each share of Series X Preferred Stock held by such Series X Holder shall
automatically, and without any further action on the part of such Series X Holder, be converted
into shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Price for the Series X Preferred Stock in effect
immediately prior to the consummation of such Qualified Financing effective upon, subject to,
and concurrently with, the consummation of the Qualified Financing. For purposes of
determining the number of shares of Series X Preferred Stock owned by a Series X Holder, and
for determining the number of Offered Securities a Series X Holder has purchased or is required
to purchase in a Qualified Financing, all shares of Series X Preferred Stock held by Affiliates of
such Series X Holder shall be aggregated with such Series X Holder’s shares and all Offered
Securities purchased by Affiliates of such Series X Holder shall be aggregated with the Offered
Securities purchased by such Series X Holder (provided that no shares or securities shall be
attributed to more than one entity or person within any such group of affiliated entities or
persons). Such conversion is referred to in this Section 3.8(a) as a “Special Mandatory
Conversion”.

(>) Procedural Requirements. Upon a Special Mandatory Conversion, each Series X
Holder whose shares are converted pursuant to Subsection 3.8(a) shall surrender his, her or its
certificate or certificates for all such shares (or, if such Series X Holder alleges that such
certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement reasonably
acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made
against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate) to
the Corporation at the place designated in such notice, and shall thereafter receive certificates for
the number of shares of Common Stock to which such Series X Holder is entitled pursuant to
this Section 3.8. All rights with respect to the Series X Preferred Stock converted pursuant to
Subsection 3.8(a), including the rights, if any, to receive notices and vote (other than as a holder

9
of Common Stock), will terminate, except only the rights of the holders thereof, upon surrender
of their certificate or certificates therefor (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement), to receive
the items provided for in the last sentence of this Subsection (b). If so required by the
Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by written
instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by
the registered holder or by his, her or its attorney duly authorized in writing.

(c) Effect of Specia) Mandatory Conversion. Any Series X Preferred Stock
converted pursuant to this Section 3.8 shall be retired and cancelled and may not be reissued as
shares of such series, and the Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate action (without
the need for stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares
of Series X Preferred Stock accordingly.

(d) Definitions. For purposes of this Section 3.8, the following definitions shall
apply:

(i) “Affiliate” shall mean, with respect to any holder of shares of Preferred
Stock, any person, entity or firm which, directly or indirectly, controls, is controlled by or
is under common control with such holder, including, without limitation, any entity of
which the holder is a partner or member, any partner, officer, director, member or
employee of such holder and any venture capital fund now or hereafter existing of which
the holder is a partner or member which is controlled by or under common control with
one or more general partners of such holder or shares the same management company
with such holder.

(ii) “Offered Securities” shall mean the equity securities (or securities
convertible into or exercisable for equity securities) of the Corporation set aside by the
Board of Directors for purchase by holders of outstanding shares of Series X Preferred
Stock in connection with a Qualified Financing, and offered to such holders.

(iii) “Pro Rata Amount” shall mean, with respect to any holder of Series X
Preferred Stock, the aggregate dollar amount of the Offered Securities to be issued
pursuant to the Qualified Financing, multiplied by the quotient obtained by dividing (A)
the number of shares of outstanding Series X Preferred Stock held by such holder by (B)
the aggregate number of outstanding shares of Series X Preferred Stock.

(iv) “Qualified Financing” shall mean (A) a transaction, approved by a
majority of the outside directors of the Board of Directors, involving the issuance or sale
of equity securities (or securities convertible into or exercisable for equity securities) of
the Corporation which would result in at least $4,000,000 in aggregate gross proceeds to
the Corporation provided that a majority of the outside directors of the Board of Directors
certifies that (I) the Corporation requires at least $4,000,000 in equity financing and has
insufficient cash resources to fund more than four months of budgeted operations from
the date of the anticipated closing of such transaction, and (I) the Corporation made
commercially reasonable efforts to enter into a term sheet for a financing to result in at

10
least $5,000,000 in aggregate gross proceeds to the Corporation by cither approaching no
fewer than four nationally recognized private equity investors familiar with the
Corporation’s industry or by engaging a nationally recognized investment banking firm
as a private placement agent, or (B) a Second Tranche Financing.

(v) “Second Tranche Financing” shall mean the purchase by the holders of
shares of Series X Preferred Stock of a number of additional shares of Series X Preferred
Stock equal to 50% of the number of shares of Series X Preferred Stock purchased by
such holder under, and as required under Section 1.3(b) of, the Series X Convertible
Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement, dated on or about the date hereof.

3.9. Optional Conversion: Mechanics.

(a) Conversion Ratio. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the
option of the holder thereof, at any time into such number of shares of Common Stock equal to
the number obtained by dividing the Original Issue Price per share of such series of Preferred
Stock by the conversion price computed as hereinafter set forth (the “Conversion Price”) in
effect for such Preferred Stock at the time of conversion. The initial Conversion Price for the
Series X Preferred Stock is $1.00 per share, and the initial Conversion Price for the Series AA
Preferred Stock is $1.00 per share. The Conversion Prices for the Series X Preferred Stock and

the Series AA Preferred Stock are subject to adjustment from time to time as hereinafter
provided.

(b) Termination of Conversion Rights. In the event of a notice of redemption of any
shares of Series X Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 3.4, the conversion rights of the shares
designated for redemption shall terminate at the close of business on the last full day preceding
the date fixed for redemption, unless the redemption price is not fully paid on such redemption
date, in which case ths conversion rights for such shares shal! continue until such price is paid in
full. In the event of a Liquidation or a Deemed Liquidation, the conversion rights of the holders
of Preferred Stock shall terminate at the close of business on the last full day preceding the date

fixed for the payment of any such amounts distributable on such event to the holders of Preferred
Stock.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. Conversion rights shall be exercised by the surrender
of certificate(s) representing shares of Preferred Stock to be converted to the Corporation at any
time during usual business hours at its principal place of business to be maintained by it (or such
other office or agency of the Corporation as the Corporation may designate by notice in writing
to the holders of Preferred Stock), accompanied by written notice that the holder elects to convert
such shares of Preferred Stock and specifying the name or names (with address) in which a
certificate or certificates for ehares of Common Stock are to be issued and (if so required by the
Corporation) by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form reasonably satisfactory to
the Corporation duly executed by the holder or its duly authorized legal representative and
transfer tax stamps or funds therefor, if required pursuant to Section 3.9(i). All certificates
representing shares of Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion shall be delivered to the
Corporation for cancellation and canceled by it. As promptly as practicable after the surrender of

11
any shares of Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall (subject to compliance with the applicable
provisions of federal and state securities laws) deliver to the holder of such shares so surrendered
certificate(s) representing the number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock
into which such shares are entitled to be converted. At the time of the surrender of such
certificate(s), the person in whose name any certificate(s) for shares of Common Stock shall be
issuable upon such conversion shall be deemed to be the holder of record of such shares of
Common Stock on such date, notwithstanding that the share register of the Corporation shall be
then closed or that the certificates representing such Common Stock shall not then be actually
delivered to such person. On the date of such optional conversion pursuant to Section 3.9(a)
above or of such automatic conversion pursuant to Section 3.7 above, all rights with respect to
the shares of Preferred Stock so converted, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and
vote, shall terminate, except only the rights of holders thereof to (i) receive certificates for the
number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Preferred Stock have been
converted and (ii) exercise the rights to which they are entitled as holders of Common Stock.

(d) Adjustment to Conversion Price. The Conversion Price is subject to adjustment
from time to time as follows:

@) —_ Dividends. In case the Corporation shall declare a dividend or other
distribution upon its shares of Common Stock payable otherwise than in cash out of
earnings or surplus (including a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock), then
thereafter, each holder of shares of Preferred Stock upon the conversion thereof will be
entitled to receive the number of shares of Common Stock into which such Preferred
Stock shall be converted and, in addition and without payment therefor, the cash, stock or
other securities and other property (including Common Stock) that such holder would
have received by way of dividends or distributions (otherwise than out of earnings or
surplus) if continuously since the record date for any such dividend or distribution such
holder (i) had been the record holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into
which such shares of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, and (ii) had retained all
dividends or distributions m stock or securities payable in respect of such Common Stock
or in respect of any stock or securities paid as dividends or distributions and originating
directly or indirectly from such Common Stock.

Gi) Subdivisions and Combinations. In case the Corporation shall at any time
subdivide or split its outstanding sbares of Common Stock into a greater number of
shares (whether by stock split, stock dividend or otherwise), the Conversion Price in
effect immediately prior to such subdivision or split shal! be proportionately reduced, and
conversely, in case the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined into a
smaller number of shares, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such
combination shall be proportionately increased.

(iii) Reorganizations. If any capital reorganization or reclassification of the
capital stock of the Corporation, or consolidation or merger of the Corporation with
another corporation, limited liability company or other entity, or the sale of all or
substantially all of its assets to another corporation shall be effected in such a way that

12
holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive stock, securities or assets with
respect to or in exchange for shares of Common Stock, then, as a condition of such
reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger or sale, lawful and adequate
provision shall be made whereby the holders of the Preferred Stock shall thereafter have
the right to receive, upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified in such
reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, sale or merger and in Lieu of the shares of
Common Stock immediately theretofore receivable upon the conversion of the Preferred
Stock, such shares of stock, securities or assets as may be issued or payable with respect
to or in exchange for a number of outstanding shares of Common Stock equal to the
number of shares of Common Stock immediately theretofore receivable upon the
conversion of the Preferred Stock had such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation,
merger or sale not taken place, and in any such case appropriate provision shall be made
with respect to the rights and interests of the holders of the Preferred Stock to the end that
the provisions hereof (including without limitation provisions for adjustments of the
Conversion Price for the Preferred Stock and of the number of shares receivable upon the
conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as may be, in
relation to any shares of stock, securities or assets thereafter receivable upon the
conversion of the Preferred Stock. The Corporation shall not effect any such
consolidation, merger or sale, unless prior to the consummation thereof the surviving
corporation (if other than the Corporation), the corporation resulting from such
consolidation or the corporation purchasing such assets shall assume by written
instrument executed and mailed to the registered holders of the Preferred Stock at the last
address of such holders appearing on the books of the Corporation, the obligation to
deliver to such holders such shares of stock, securities or assets as, in accordance with the
foregoing provisions, such holders may be entitled to receive.

grant of options or other purchase or similar rights to employees, officers, directors,
advisers, consultants or independent contractors of the Corporation on and after the date
hereof pursuant to an option poo! or Corporation stock option or incentive plan, and the
issuance of such shares of capital stock upon the exercise of such options, (ii) shares of
Common Stock, and securities convertible into shares of Common Stock, to certain
Corporation suppliers, manufacturers, investment advisors or licensees pursuant to any
agreement, letter of intent or other documentation existing as of the date hereof and (iii)
shares of Common Stock, and securities convertible into shares of Common Stock to
financial institutions or-lessors in connection with commercial credit arrangements,
equipment financings or similar non-equity financing transactions (the shares described
in (A) and (B) are collectively referred to herein as “Exempt Shares” which shares shall
be appropriately adjusted to reflect stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations,
consolidations and similar changes), if and whenever the Corporation shall issue or sell
(or be deemed in accordance with this Section 3.9(d)iv) to have issued or sold) any
shares of its Common Stock, issue any right or option to purchase Common Stock or any

13
security convertible into Common Stock for a consideration per share less than the

' Conversion Price applicable to a series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to
the time of such issuance or sale, then, upon such issuance or sale, the respective
Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock so affected shall forthwith (except as
otherwise provided in this Section 3.9(d)) be adjusted to a price determined by
multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance
(including shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to Section
3.9(d){iv)(A) or (B)) plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate
consideration received by this Corporation for such issuance would purchase at such
Conversion Price; and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance (including shares of
Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to Section 3.9(d}{iv)(A) or (B)) plus the
number of shares of Common Stock issued or deemed issued pursuant to such gale.

(v) Value of ideration. In the case of the issuance of Common
Stock for cash, the consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor
before deducting any discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred
by the Corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and
sale thereof.

(vi) Value of Non-Cash Consideration. In the case of the issuance of Common
Stock for a consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than
cash shall be deemed to be the fair value thereof as determined by the Board of Directors
irrespective of any accounting treatment; provided, however, that if the holders of at least
66-2/3% of all the then-outstanding shares of Series X Preferred Stock disagree with the
determination of the Board of Directors, the fair value thereof shall be determined by an
independent investment bank of national standing chosen by the Corporation and agreed
to by such holders.

(vii) Options, Convertible Securities, etc. In the case of the issuance (whether
before, on or after the applicable purchase date) of options to purchase or rights to
subscribe for Common Stock, securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable
for Common Stock or options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or
exchangeable securities, the following provisions shall apply for all purposes of this
Section 3.9(d):

(A) The aggregate maximum number of shares of Common Stock
deliverable upon exercise (to the extent then exercisable) of such options to
purchase or rights to subscribe for Common Stock shall be deemed to have been
issued at the time such options or rights were issued and for a consideration equal
to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in Sections 3.9(d)(v) and
(vi)), if any, received by the Corporation upon the issuance of such options or
rights plus the minimum exercise price provided in such options or rights for the
Common Stock covered thereby.

14
(B) The aggregate maximum number of shares of Common Stock
deliverable upon conversion of, or in exchange (tothe extent then convertible or
exchangeable) for, ary such convertible or exchangeable securities or upon the
exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or
exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof shall be
deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or such
options or rights were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration, if
any, received by the Corporation for any such securities and related options or
rights (excluding any cash received on account of accrued interest or declared but
unpaid dividends), plus the minimum additional consideration, if any, to be
received by the Corporation upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or
the exercise of any related options or rights (the consideration in each case to be
determined in the manner provided in Section 3.9(d)(v) and (vi).

(C) In the event of any change in the number of shares of Common
Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon exercise
of such options or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such
convertible or exchangeable securities, including, but not limited to, a change
resulting from the antidilution provisions thereof (unless such options or rights or
convertible or exchangeable securities were merely deemed to be included in the
numerator and denominator for purposes of determining the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding for purposes of Section 3.9(d)iii)), the Conversion
Price of the Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or computed
using such options, rights or securities, shall be recomputed to reflect such
change; provided, however, that (i) no readjustment pursuant to this clause shall
have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price to an amount which exceeds
such Conversion Price on the original adjustment date. and (ij) no further
adjustment shall be made for the actual issuance of Common Stock or any
payment of such consideration upon the exercise of any such options or rights or
the conversion or exchange of such securities.

(D) Upon the expiration of any such options or rights, the termination
of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options or rights
related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Conversion Price of the
Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such
options, rights or securities or options or rights related to such securities (unless
such options or rights were merely deemed to be included in the numerator and
denominator for purposes of determining the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding for purposes of Section 3.9(d)iii)), shall be recomputed to reflect the
issuance of only the number of shares of Common Stock (and convertible or
exchangeable securities that remain in effect) actually issued upon the exercise of
such options or rights, upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or upon
the exercise of the options or rights related to such securities; provided, however,
that no readjustment pursuant to this clause shall have the effect of increasing the

15
Conversion Price to an amount which exceeds such Conversion Price on the

(viii) De Minimis Adjustments. No adjustment of the Conversion Price for the
Preferred Stock shall be made in an amount less than one cent per share, provided that
any adjustments that are not required to be made by reason of this sentence shall be
carried forward and shall be either taken into account (A) in any subsequent adjustment
made prior to three (3) years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment
being carried forward, or (B) at the end of three (3) years from the date of the event
giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward or (C) in the event of a conversion
pursuant to either Section 3.7 or 3.9 hereof. Except to the extent provided for in Section
3.9(dXii) and Sections 3.9(d){viiXC) and (D)), no adjustment of such Conversion Price
pursuant to this Section 3.9(d) shall have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price
above the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment.

(ix) Waiver and Modification. The antidilution provisions of this Section
3.9(d) may be waived or modified by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66-

the Corporation, which notice shall state the Conversion Price resulting from such adjustment
