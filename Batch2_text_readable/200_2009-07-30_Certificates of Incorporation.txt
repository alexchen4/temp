the Series C Preferred) per share (the “Series C Maximum Participation Amount’), each

4, Optional Conversion.

The holders of Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as follows (the
“Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert.

13
B3630880.8
(i) Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of
the holder thereof, at any time and from time to time, and without the payment of additional
consideration by the holder thereof, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Common Stock as is determined by dividing (i) in the case of the Series A Preferred, the Series
A Original Issue Price by the Series A Conversion Price (as defined below) in effect at the time
of conversion, (ii) in the case of the Series B Preferred, the Series B Original Issue Price by the
Series B Conversion Price (as defined below) in effect at the time of conversion, (iii) in the case
of the Series B-1] Preferred, the Series B-1 Original Issue Price by the Series B-1 Conversion
Price (as defined below) in effect at the time of conversion, and (iv) in the case of the Series C
Preferred, the Series C Original Issue Price by the Series C Conversion Price (as defined below)
in effect at the time of conversion.

(11) Definitions.

(A) The “Series A Conversion Price” shall initially be equal
to $0.8607. Such initial Series A Conversion Price, and the rate at which shares of Series A
Preferred may be converted into shares of Common Stock, shall be subject to adjustment

pursuant to Subsection 4(d)(iv).

(B) The “Series B Conversion Price” shall initially be
$0.9771. Such initial Series B Conversion Price, and the rate at which shares of Series B
Preferred may be converted into shares of Common Stock, shall be subject to adjustment

pursuant to Subsection 4(d)(iv).

(C) The “Series B-1 Conversion Price” shall initially be
$1.2763. Such initial Series B-1 Conversion Price, and the rate at which shares of Series B-1
Preferred may be converted into shares of Common Stock, shall be subject to adjustment

pursuant to Subsection 4(d)(iv).

(D) The “Series C Conversion Price” shall initially be equal to
the Series C Original Issue Price. Such initial Series C Conversion Price, and the rate at which
shares of Series C Preferred may be converted into shares of Common Stock, shall be subject to

adjustment pursuant to Subsection 4(d)(iv).

In the event of a notice of redemption of any shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to
Section 6 hereof, the Conversion Rights of the shares designated for redemption shall terminate
at the close of business on the last full day preceding the date fixed for redemption, unless the
redemption price is not fully paid on such redemption date, in which case the Conversion Rights
for such shares shall continue until such price is paid in full. In the event of a liquidation,
dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation or a Deemed Liquidation Event, the Conversion
Rights shall terminate at the close of business on the last full day preceding the date fixed for the
payment of any such amounts distributable in such event to the holders of Preferred Stock.

(b) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon
conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would
otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair
market value of a share of Common Stock as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors

14
B3630880.8
of the Corporation. Whether or not fractional shares would be issuable upon such conversion
shall be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock the holder is at
the time converting into Common Stock and the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion.

(i) In order for a holder of Preferred Stock to voluntarily convert
shares of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the
certificate or certificates for such shares of Preferred Stock (or, if such registered holder alleges
that such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement
reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that
may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such
certificate), at the office of the transfer agent for the Preferred Stock (or at the principal office of
the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent), together with written notice
that such holder elects to convert all or any number of the shares of Preferred Stock represented
by such certificate or certificates and. if applicable, any event on which such conversion is
contingent. Such notice shall state such holder’s name or the names of the nominees in which
such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued. If
required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or
accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the
Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or his, her or its attorney duly authorized in
writing. The close of business on the date of receipt by the transfer agent (or by the Corporation
if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent) of such certificates (or lost certificate
affidavit and agreement) and notice shall be the time of conversion (the “Conversion Time”),
and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the shares represented by such
certificate shall be deemed to be outstanding of record as of such date. The Corporation shall, as
soon as practicable after the Conversion Time, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of
Preferred Stock, or to his, her or its nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of
shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled, together with cash in lieu of any
fraction of a share and payment of any dividends declared but unpaid on the shares of Preferred
Stock converted.

(ii) | The Corporation shall at all times when Preferred Stock shall be
outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued stock, for the purpose
of effecting the conversion of Preferred Stock, such number of its duly authorized shares of
Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding
Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common
Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of Preferred
Stock, the Corporation shall take such corporate action as may be necessary to increase its
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient
for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite
stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation. Before
taking any action which would cause an adjustment reducing the Conversion Price of any series
of Preferred Stock below the then par value of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of Preferred Stock, the Corporation wil! take any corporate action which may, in the

15
B3630880.8
opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Corporation may validly and legally issue
fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion Price.

(iit) All shares of Preferred Stock which shall have been surrendered
for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights with
respect to such shares, including the rights as a holder of Preferred Stock, if any, to receive
notices and to vote with respect to the shares of Preferred Stock being converted, shall
immediately cease and terminate at the Conversion Time, except only the right of the holders
thereof to reccive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor and to receive payment of any
dividends declared but unpaid thereon. Any shares of Preferred Stock so converted shall be
retired and cancelled and shall not be reissued as shares of such series, and the Corporation
(without the need for stockholder action) may from time to time take such appropriate action as
may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Preferred Stock accordingly.

(tv) Upon any such conversion, no adjustment to the Conversion Price
shall be made for any declared but unpaid dividends on any series of Preferred Stock surrendered
for conversion or on the Common Stock delivered upon conversion, provided that such declared
but unpaid dividends are paid in cash.

(v) | The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and other similar taxes
that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon
conversion of shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4. The Corporation shall not,
however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in
the issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in which the
shares of Preferred Stock so converted were registered, and no such issuance or delivery shall be
made unless and until the person or entity requesting such issuance has paid to the Corporation
the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax
has been paid.

(d) Adjustments to Conversion Price for Diluting Issues.

(i) Special Definitions. For purposes of this Article Fourth, the
following definitions shall apply:

(A) “Option” shall mean rights, options or warrants to
subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire Common Stock or Convertible Securities.

(B) “Series C Original Issue Date” shall mean the date on
which the first share of Series C Preferred was issued.

(C) “Convertible Securities” shall mean any evidences of
indebtedness, shares or other securities directly or indirectly convertible into or exchangeable for
Common Stock, including the Preferred Stock, but excluding Options.

(D) “Additional Shares of Common Stock” shall mean all
shares of Common Stock issued (or, pursuant to Subsection 4(d)(iii) below, deemed to be issued)
by the Corporation after the Series C Original Issue Date, other than the following (“Exempted
Securities”):

(ii) | No Adjustment of Conversion Price. No adjustment in the
Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock shall be made as the result of the issuance or

deemed issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock if prior to such issuance or deemed
issuance, the Corporation receives written notice from (A) the Required Holders with respect to
any proposed adjustment to the Series A Preferred Conversion Price, the Series B Preferred
Conversion Price or the Series C Conversion Price or (B) a majority of the Series B-1 Preferred
Shares with respect to a proposed adjustment to the Series B-1 Preferred Conversion Price

securities entitled to receive any such Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum
number of shares of Common Stock (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto, assuming the
satisfaction of any conditions to exercisability, convertibility or exchangeability but without
regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable
upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities and Options therefor,
the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to be Additional
Shares of Common Stock issued as of the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shall
have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date.

18
B3630880.8
(B) ‘If the terms of any Option or Convertible Security, the
issuance of which resulted in an adjustment to the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred
Stock pursuant to the terms of Subsection 4(d)(iv) below, are revised (either automatically
pursuant to the provisions contained therein or as a result of an amendment to such terms) to
provide for either (1) any increase or decrease in the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any such Option or Convertible Security
or (2) any increase or decrease in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon such
exercise, conversion or exchange, then, effective upon such increase or decrease becoming
effective, the Conversion Price or Prices computed upon the original issue of such Option or
Convertible Security (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto) shall be
readjusted to such Conversion Price or Prices as would have obtained had such revised terms
been in effect upon the original date of issuance of such Option or Convertible Security.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no readjustment pursuant to this clause (B) shall have the effect
of increasing the Conversion Price with respect to any series of Preferred Stock to an amount
which exceeds the lower of (i) the applicable Conversion Price on the original adjustment date,
or (ii) the applicable Conversion Price that would have resulted from any issuances of Additional
Shares of Common Stock between the original adjustment date and such readjustment date.

(C) If the terms of any Option or Convertible Security
(excluding Options or Convertible Securities which, upon exercise, conversion or exchange
thereof, would entitle the holder thereof to receive Exempted Securities pursuant to Subsection
4(d)(i)(D)Q), (ID, AID or (V)), the issuance of which did not result in an adjustment to the
Conversion Price pursuant to the terms of Subsection 4(d)(iv) below (either because the
consideration per share (determined pursuant to Subsection 4(d)(v) hereof) of the Additional
Shares of Common Stock subject thereto was equal to or greater than the Conversion Price then
in effect with respect to any series of Preferred Stock, or because such Option or Convertible
Security was issued before the Series C Original Issue Date), are revised after the Series C
Original Issue Date (either automatically pursuant to the provisions contained therein or as a
result of an amendment to such terms) to provide for either (1) any increase or decrease in the
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any
such Option or Convertible Security or (2) any increase or decrease in the consideration payable
to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion or exchange, then such Option or Convertible
Security, as so amended, and the Additional Shares of Common Stock subject thereto
(determined in the manner provided in Subsection 4(d)(iii)(A) above) shall be deemed to have
been issued effective upon such increase or decrease becoming effective.

(D) Upon the expiration or termination of any unexercised
Option or unconverted or unexchanged Convertible Security which resulted (either upon its
original issuance or upon a revision of its terms) in an adjustment to the Conversion Price of any
series of Preferred Stock pursuant to the terms of Subsection 4(d)(iv) below, the Conversion
Price of such series shall be readjusted to such Conversion Price as would have obtained had
such Option or Convertible Security never been issued.

(iv) Adjustment _of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional
Shares of Common Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Series C

Original Issue Date issue Additional Shares of Common Stock (including Additional Shares of
Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to Subsection 4(d)(iii)), without consideration or

19

B3630880.8
for a consideration per share less than the Series C Conversion Price, then the Conversion Price
of each series shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest
one-hundredth of a cent) determined in accordance with the following formula:

CP, = CP; *(A+B)+(A+C).
For purposes of the foregoing formula, the following definitions shall apply:

(A) “CP,” shall mean the Conversion Price applicable to such
series in effect immediately after such issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock;

(B) “CP,” shall mean the Conversion Price applicable to such
series in effect immediately prior to such issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock;

(C) “A” shall mean the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock (treating for
this purpose as outstanding all shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Options
outstanding immediately prior to such issue or upon conversion or exchange of Convertible
Securities (including the Preferred Stock) outstanding (assuming exercise of any outstanding
Options therefor) immediately prior to such issue);

(D) “B” shall mean the number of shares of Common Stock
that would have been issuable if such Additional Shares of Common Stock had been issued at a
price per share equal to the Series C Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issue
of Additional Shares of Common Stock (determined by dividing the aggregate consideration
received by the Corporation in respect of such issue by the Series C Conversion Price); and

(E)  “C” shall mean the number of such Additional Shares of
Common Stock issued in such transaction.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this
Subsection 4(d), the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional
Shares of Common Stock shall be computed as follows:

(A) | Cash and Property: Such consideration shall:

(1) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
aggregate amount of cash received by the
Corporation, excluding amounts paid or payable for
accrued interest;

(I) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair market value thereof at the
time of such issue, as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors of the Corporation; and

(II) in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock
are issued together with other shares or securities or

20
B3630880.8
other assets of the Corporation for consideration
which covers both, be the proportion of such
consideration so received, computed as provided in
clauses (I) and (11) above, as determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

(B) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per
share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been

issued pursuant to Subsection 4(d)(iii), relating to Options and Convertible Securities, shall be
determined by dividing

(1) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by
the Corporation as consideration for the issue of
such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the
minimum aggregate amount of additional
consideration (as set forth in the instruments
relating thereto, without regard to any provision
contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of
such consideration) payable to the Corporation upon
the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the
case of Options for Convertible Securities, the
exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities
and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, by

(II) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock
(as set forth in the instruments relating thereto,
without regard to any provision contained therein
for a subsequent adjustment of such number)
issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities.

(vi) Multiple Closing Dates. In the event the Corporation shall issue on
more than one date Additional Shares of Common Stock that are a part of one transaction or a
series of related transactions and that would result in an adjustment to the Conversion Price of
any series of Preferred Stock pursuant to the terms of Subsection 4(d)iv) above, and such
issuances occur within a period of no more than 30 days from the first such issuance to the final
such issuance, then, upon the final such issuance, the applicable Conversion Price shall be
readjusted to give effect to all such issuances as if they occurred on the date of the first such
issuance (and without giving effect to any additional adjustments as a result of any such
subsequent issuances within such period).

(e) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If the Corporation shall at any
time or from time to time after the Series C Original Issue Date effect a subdivision of the
outstanding Common Stock without a comparable subdivision of Preferred Stock or combine the

21
B3630880.8
ae ne

outstanding shares of Preferred Stock without a comparable combination of the Common Stock,
the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately before that
subdivision or combination shall be proportionately decreased so that the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable on conversion of cach share of such series shall be increased in
proportion to such increase in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. If
the Corporation shall at any time or from time to time after the Series C Original Issue Date
combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock without a comparable combination of the
Preferred Stock or effect a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock without a
comparable subdivision of the Common Stock, the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred
Stock in effect immediately before the combination or subdivision shall be proportionately
increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of
such series shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in the aggregate number of shares
of Common Stock outstanding. Any adjustment under this subsection shall become effective at
the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective.

(f) Adjustment for Certain Dividends and Distributions. In the event the Corporation
at any time or from time to time after the Series C Original Issue Date shall make or issue, or fix
a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or
other distribution payable on the Common Stock in additional shares of Common Stock, then
and in each such event the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock in effect
immediately before such event shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance or, in the event
such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, by
multiplying the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock then in effect by a fraction:

(1) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of
business on such record date, and

(2) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of
business on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of
such dividend or distribution;

provided, however, that if such record date shal] have been fixed and such dividend is not fully
paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the Conversion Price of
each series of Preferred Stock shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on
such record date and thereafter the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock shall be
adjusted pursuant to this subsection as of the time of actual payment of such dividends or
distributions; and provided further, however, that no such adjustment shall be made if the holders
of Preferred Stock simultaneously receive a dividend or other distribution of shares of Common
Stock in a number equal to the number of shares of Common Stock they would have received if
all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock on the date of
such event.

(g) Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. In the event the Corporation
at any time or from time to time after the Series C Original Issue Date shall make or issue, or fix
a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or

22
B3630880,8
other distribution payable in securities of the Corporation (other than a distribution of shares of
Common Stock in respect of outstanding shares of Common Stock) or in other property and the
provisions of Section 1 do not otherwise preclude such dividend or distribution, then and in each
such event the holders of Preferred Stock shall receive, simultaneously with the distribution to
the holders of Common Stock, a dividend or other distribution of such securities or other
property in an amount equal to the amount of such securities or other property as they would
have received if all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock had been converted into Common
Stock on the date of such event.

(h) Adjustment for Merger or Reorganization, etc. Subject to the provisions of
Subsection 2(c), if there shall occur any reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,

consolidation or merger involving the Corporation in which the Common Stock (but not
Preferred Stock) is converted into or exchanged for securities, cash or other property (other than
a transaction covered by Subsection (e), (f) or (g) of this Section 4), then, following any such
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger, each share of Preferred
Stock shall thereafter be convertible in lieu of the Common Stock into which it was convertible
prior to such event into the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property which a holder
of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation issuable upon conversion of one
share of Preferred Stock immediately prior to such reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, consolidation or merger would have been entitled to receive pursuant to such
transaction; and, in such case, appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith by the Board
of Directors of the Corporation) shall be made in the application of the provisions in this
Section 4 with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the holders of Preferred Stock, to
the end that the provisions set forth in this Section 4 (including provisions with respect to
changes in and other adjustments of the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock) shall
thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any securities or other
property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock.

(i) Certificate _as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4
the Corporation at its expense shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable but in any event not
later than 10 days thereafter, compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the
terms hereof and furnish to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such
adjustment or readjustment (including the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property
into which the Preferred Stock is convertible) and showing in detail the facts upon which such
adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the written request at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock (but in any
event not later than 10 days thereafter), furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a
certificate setting forth (i) the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock then in effect
and held by such holder, and (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any,
of other securities, cash or property which then would be received upon the conversion of
Preferred Stock.

Gj) Notice of Record Date. In the event:

(i) the Corporation shall take a record of the holders of its Common
Stock (or other stock or securities at the time issuable upon conversion of Preferred Stock) for

23
B3630880.8

the purpose of entitling or enabling them to receive any dividend or other distribution, or to
receive any right to subscribe for or purchase any shares of stock of any class or any other
securities, or to receive any other right; or

(ii) of any capital reorganization of the Corporation, any
reclassification of the Common Stock of the Corporation, or any Liquidation Event,

then, and in each such case, the Corporation will give or cause to be given to the holders of
Preferred Stock a notice specifying, as the case may be, (i) the record date for such dividend,
distribution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right, or (ii)
the effective date on which such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer,
dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is proposed to take place, and the time, if any is to be
fixed, as of which the holders of record of Common Stock (or such other stock or securities at
the time issuable upon the conversion of Preferred Stock) shall be entitled to exchange their
shares of Common Stock (or such other stock or securities) for securities or other property
deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer,
dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, and the amount per share and character of such exchange
applicable to Preferred Stock and the Common Stock. Such notice shall be given at least 15
business days prior to the record date or effective date for the event specified in such notice.

5. Mandatory Conversion.

(a) Upon the earlier of (A) the closing of the sale of shares of Common Stock to the
public at a price of at least $1.7584 per share (subject to appropriate adjustment for stock splits,
stock dividends, combinations and other similar recapitalizations affecting such shares), in a
firm-commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, resulting in at least $25,000,000 of proceeds, net
of the underwriting discount and commissions, to the Corporation (a “Qualified IPO”) or (B) a
date specified by vote or written consent of the Required Holders (the date of such closing or
such vote or written consent is referred to herein as the “Mandatory Conversion Date’), (y) all
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of Common
Stock at the then effective Conversion Price and (z) such shares may not be reissued by the
Corporation as shares of such series.

(b) All holders of record of shares of Preferred Stock shall be given written notice of
the Mandatory Conversion Date and the place designated for mandatory conversion of all such
shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 5. Such notice need not be given in advance of
the occurrence of the Mandatory Conversion Date. Upon receipt of such notice, each holder of
shares of Preferred Stock shall surrender his, her or its certificate or certificates for all such
shares to the Corporation at the place designated in such notice, and shall thereafter receive
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to this Section 5. On the Mandatory Conversion Date, all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock
shall be deemed to have been converted into shares of Common Stock, which shall be deemed to
be outstanding of record, and all rights with respect to Preferred Stock so converted, including
the rights, if any, to receive notices and vote (other than as a holder of Common Stock), will
terminate, except only the rights of the holders thereof, upon surrender of their certificate or
certificates therefor, to receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which

24
B3630880.8
such Preferred Stock has been converted, and payment of any declared but unpaid dividends
thereon. If so required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be
endorsed or accompanied by written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to
the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or by his, her or its attorney duly
authorized in writing. As soon as practicable after the Mandatory Conversion Date and the
surrender of the certificate or certificates for Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall cause to be
issued and delivered to such holder, or on his, her or its written order, a certificate or certificates
for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable on such conversion in accordance with
the provisions hereof and cash as provided in Subsection 4(b) in respect of any fraction of a
share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion.

(c) Subject to Subsection 5(b) above, all certificates evidencing shares of Preferred
Stock which are required to be surrendered for conversion in accordance with the provisions
hereof shall, from and after the Mandatory Conversion Date, be deemed to have been retired and
cancelled and the shares of Preferred Stock represented thereby converted into Common Stock
for all purposes, notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender such
certificates on or prior to such date. Such converted Preferred Stock may not be reissued as
shares of such series, and the Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate action (without
the need for stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares
of Preferred Stock accordingly.

SA. Special Mandatory Conversion.

(a) Trigger Event. In the event that any Major Preferred Holder does not participate
in the Qualified Financing (as defined below) by purchasing in the aggregate, in the Qualified
Financing and within the time period specified by the Corporation (provided that the Corporation
has sent to each Major Preferred Holder at least 15 business days prior written notice of, and the
opportunity to purchase its Required Amount (as defined below) of, the Qualified Financing),
such holder’s Required Amount, then each share of Preferred Stock held by such holder shall
automatically, and without any further action on the part of such holder, be converted into shares
of Common Stock at the Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series B-1
Conversion Price, or Series C Conversion Price, as applicable, in effect immediately prior to the
consummation of the Qualified Financing, effective upon, subject to, and concurrently with, the
consummation of the Qualified Financing. For purposes of determining the number of shares of
Preferred Stock owned by a holder, and for determining the number of Offered Securities (as
defined below) a Major Preferred Holder has purchased in the Qualified Financing, all shares of
Preferred Stock held by Affiliates of such holder shall be aggregated with such holder’s shares
and all Offered Securities purchased by Affiliates of such holder shall be aggregated with the
Offered Securities purchased by such holder (provided that no shares or securities shall be
attributed to more than one entity or person within any such group of affiliated entities or
persons). Such conversion is referred to as a “Special Mandatory Conversion.”

(b) Procedural Requirements. Upon a Special Mandatory Conversion, each Major
Preferred Holder whose shares of Preferred Stock are converted pursuant to Subsection 5A(a)
shall be sent written notice of such Special Mandatory Conversion and the place designated for
mandatory conversion of all such shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section SA. Upon
receipt of such notice, each holder of such shares of Preferred Stock shall surrender its certificate

25
B3630880.8
or certificates for all such shares (or, if such holder alleges that such certificate has been lost,
stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to the
Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made against the
Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate) to the
Corporation at the place designated in such notice. If so required by the Corporation, certificates
surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by written instrument or
instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered
holder or by its attorney duly authorized in writing. All rights with respect to the Preferred Stock
converted pursuant to Subsection 5A(a), including the rights, if any, to receive notices and vote
(other than as a holder of Common Stock), will terminate at the time of the Special Mandatory
Conversion (notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender the
certificates for such shares at or prior to such time), except only the rights of the holders thereof,
upon surrender of their certificate or certificates therefor (or lost certificate affidavit and
agreement), to receive the items provided for in the next sentence of this Subsection SA(b). As
soon as practicable after the Special Mandatory Conversion and the surrender of the certificate or
certificates (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement) for Preferred Stock so converted, the
Corporation shall issue and deliver to such holder, or to its nominees, a certificate or certificates
for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable on such conversion in accordance with
the provisions hereof, together with cash as provided in Subsection 4(b) in lieu of any fraction of
a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion and the payment of any
declared but unpaid dividends on the shares of Preferred Stock converted. Such converted
Preferred Stock shall be retired and cancelled and may not be reissued as shares of such series,
and the Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate action (without the need for
stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Preferred
Stock accordingly.

(c) Definitions. For purposes of this Section 5A, the following definitions shal)
apply:

(1) “Offered Securities” shal! mean the equity securities of the
Corporation set aside by the Board of Directors for purchase by holders of outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock in connection with the Qualified Financing, and offered to such holders.

business days prior to the consummation of the Qualified Financing, that such transaction not be
treated as a Qualified Financing for purposes of this Section 5A

(iii) “Qualified Financing Amount” shall mean the total dollar value
of the Offered Securities.

(iv) “Required Amount” shall mean, with respect to any holder of
Preferred Stock, a number of Offered Securities determined in accordance with the following
formula:

26
B3630880.8
For purposes of the foregoing formula, the following definitions shall apply:

(A) “FAL” shall mean the lesser of (i) the Qualified Financing
Amount and (ii) $10 million;

(B) “A” shall mean the number of shares of outstanding
Common Stock owned by such holder (treating all shares of Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of Options outstanding immediately prior to the Qualified Financing or upon conversion
of Convertible Sccurities outstanding (assuming exercise of any outstanding Options therefor)
immediately prior to the Qualified Financing as outstanding);

(C)  “B” shall mean the aggregate number of outstanding shares
of Common Stock (treating all shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Options
outstanding immediately prior to the Qualified Financing or upon conversion of Convertible
Securities outstanding (assuming exercise of any outstanding Options therefor) immediately
prior to the Qualified Financing as outstanding);

(D) “PPS” shall mean the price per share of the Offered
Securities; and

(E)  ‘“FA2” shall mean, if the Qualified Financing Amount is
greater than $10 million, the lesser of (i) the Qualified Financing Amount minus $10 million and

6. Redemption.

(a) Redemption. All of the Shares of Preferred Stock shall be redeemed by
the Corporation out of funds lawfully available therefor at a price per share equal to (i) the Series
A Liquidation Amount, in the case of the Series A Preferred, (ii) the Series B Liquidation
Amount, in the case of the Series B Preferred, (iii) the Series B-1 Liquidation Amount, in the
case of the Series B-] Preferred and (iv) the Series C Liquidation Amount, in the case of the
Series C Preferred (collectively, the “Redemption Price”), in three annual installments
commencing 60 days after receipt by the Corporation at any time on or after the fifth anniversary
of the Series C Original Issue Date from the Required Holders of written notice requesting
redemption of all shares of Preferred Stock (the date of each such installment being referred to as
a “Redemption Date”). On each Redemption Date, the Corporation shall redeem, on a pro rata
basis in accordance with the number of shares of Preferred Stock owned by each holder, that
number of outstanding shares of Preferred Stock determined by dividing (i) the total number of
shares of Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Redemption Date by (ii) the
number of remaining Redemption Dates (including the Redemption Date to which such
calculation applies). If the Corporation does not have sufficient funds legally available to
redeem on any Redemption Date all shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such
Redemption Date, then the Corporation shall redeem a pro rata portion of each holder’s
redeemable shares of Preferred Stock out of funds legally available thercfor, based on the
respective amounts which would otherwise be payable in respect of the shares to be redeemed if

the manner and at the place designated, his, her or
its certificate or certificates representing the shares
of Preferred Stock to be redeemed.

(c) Surrender _of Certificates: Payment. On or before the applicable Redemption
Date, each holder of shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such Redemption Date, unless
such holder has exercised his, her or its right to convert such shares as provided in Section 4
hereof, shall surrender the certificate or certificates representing such shares to the Corporation,
in the manner and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice, and thereupon the
Redemption Price for such shares shall be payable to the order of the person whose name appears
on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof. In the event fewer than all of the shares
of Preferred Stock represented by a certificate are redeemed, a new certificate representing the
unredeemed shares of Preferred Stock shall promptly be issued to such holder.

(d) Rights Subsequent to Redemption. If the Redemption Notice shall have been
duly given, and if on the applicable Redemption Date the Redemption Price payable upon
redemption of the shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such Redemption Date is paid or
tendered for payment or deposited with an independent payment agent so as to be available
therefor, then notwithstanding that the certificates evidencing any of the shares of Preferred
Stock so called for redemption shall not have been surrendered, dividends with respect to such
shares of Preferred Stock shall cease to accrue after such Redemption Date and all rights with
respect to such shares shall forthwith after the Redemption Date terminate, except only the right
of the holders to receive the Redemption Price without interest upon surrender of their
certificates therefor.

granted to the holders of Preferred Stock following redemption.

(f) Failure to Redeem. If the Corporation for any reason fails to redeem any of the
shares of Preferred Stock in accordance with this Section 6 on or prior to the Redemption Dates
determined in accordance with this Section 6, then, in addition to any other remedies available to
the holders of Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall become obligated to pay, quarterly and in
arrears, in addition to the Redemption Price, interest on the unpaid balance of such price, which
shall accrue at a rate equal to the lesser of (i) fifteen percent (15%) per annum or (ii) the
maximum interest rate allowable under applicable law, until such price is paid in full. If such
failure shall continue for more than 90 days and the Preferred Directors do not constitute a
majority of the number of directors constituting the whole Board of Directors of the Corporation,
then, upon receipt of written notice from the Required Holders, the total number of directors
shall be increased to accommodate, and the holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled, voting
exclusively and as a single class, to elect, such number of additional directors as is necessary to
give the holders of Preferred Stock the right to elect a majority of the directors constituting the
whole Board of Directors of the Corporation.
