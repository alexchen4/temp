been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, provided that (i) Additional Shares of
Common Stock shall not be deemed to have been issued with respect to an adjustment of any

conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have been exercised,

consideration actually received by the Company for the issue of such Options, whether or not
exercised, plus the consideration actually received by the Company upon such exercise or for the
issue of all such Convertible Securities which were actually converted or exchanged, plus the
additional consideration, if any, actually received by the Company upon such conversion or
exchange, and

b. in the case of Options for Convertible Securities
only the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were issued at
the time of issue of such Options, and the consideration recetved by the Company for the
Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been then issued was the consideration
actually received by the Company for the issue of such Options, whether or not exercised, plus
the consideration deemed to have been received by the Company (determined pursuant to

(4) no readjustment pursuant to clause (2) or (3) above
shall have the effect of increasing any Conversion Price to an amount which exceeds the lower of
(i) such Conversion Price on the original adjustment date, or (i1) such Conversion Price that
would have resulted from any issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock between the
original adjustment date and such readjustment date;

(5) in the case of any Options which expire by their terms
not more than 30 days after the date of issue thereof, no adjustment of any Conversion Price shall
be made until the expiration or exercise of all such Options issued on the same date, whereupon
such adjustment shall be made in the same manner provided in clause (3) above; and

(6) if such record date shall have been fixed and such
Options or Convertible Securities are not issued on the date fixed therefor, the adjustment
previously made in any Conversion Price which became effective on such record date shall be
canceled as of the close of business on such record date, and thereafter such Conversion Price
shall be adjusted pursuant to this Section 4(d)(ii) as of the actual date of their issuance.

(B) Stock Dividends, Stock Distributions and Subdivisions. In
the event the Company at any time or from time to time after the Series B Issue Date shall
declare or pay any dividend or make any other distribution on the Common Stock payable in
Common Stock or effect a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by
reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in Common Stock), then and in any
such event, Additional Shares of Common Stock shall be deemed to have been issued:

(1) in the case of any such dividend or distribution,
immediately after the close of business on the record date for the determination of holders of any
class of securities entitled to receive such dividend or distribution, or

(2) in the case of any such subdivision, at the close of
business on the date immediately prior to the date upon which such corporate action becomes
effective.

the payment date fixed therefor, the adjustment previously made in any Conversion Price which
became effective on such record date shall be canceled as of the close of business on such record
date, and thereafter such Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this Section 4(d)(i1) as of
the time of actual payment of such dividend, if any.

(iii) Adjustment of Conversion Price.

(A) Adjustment of Series Preferred Conversion Price Upon
Issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock. In the event the Company shall issue
Additional Shares of Common Stock (including Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to
be issued pursuant to Section 4(d)(ii), but excluding Additional Shares of Common Stock issued
pursuant to Section 4(d)(ii)(B), which event is dealt with in Section 4(d)(v) hereof), without
consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Series A-1 Conversion Price in effect
on the date of and immediately prior (o such issue, then and in such event, each Series Preferred
Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the

12

LA_DOCS\777045.L0[W2000]
nearest cent) determined by multiplying such Series Preferred Conversion Price by a fraction

(x) the numerator of which shall be (1) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to such issue, plus (2) the number of shares of Common Stock which the
aggregate consideration received by the Company for the total number of Additional Shares of
Common Stock so issued would purchase at such Series Preferred Conversion Price, and (y) the
denominator of which shal] be (1) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to such issue plus (2) the number of such Additional Shares of Common Stock
so issued, provided that for the purposes of this Section 4(d)(ii1)(A), all shares of Common Stock
issuable upon exercise, conversion or exchange of outstanding Options, Convertible Securities
and shares of Preferred Stock, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be outstanding, and
immediately after any Additional Shares of Common Stock are deemed issued pursuant to
Section 4(d)}(ii) above, such Additional Shares of Common Stock shall be deemed to be
outstanding, and provided further that such Series Preferred Conversion Price shall not be so
reduced at such time if the amount of such reduction would be an amount less than $0.01, but
any such amount shall be carried forward and reduction with respect thereto made at the time of
and together with any subsequent reduction which, together with such amount and any other
amount or amounts so carried forward, shall aggregate $0.01 or more.

(B) — Adjustment of Series B Conversion Price Upon Issuance of
Additional Shares of Common Stock. In the event the Company shall issue Additional Shares of
Common Stock (including Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to
Section 4(d)(i1), but excluding Additional Shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to
Section 4(d)(i)(B), which event is dealt with in Section 4(d)(v) hereof), without consideration or
for a consideration per share less than the Series B Conversion Price in effect on the date of and
immediately prior to such issue, then and in such event, the Series B Conversion Price shall be
reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest cent) equal to the net
consideration per share for such Additional Stock, provided that the Series B Conversion Price
shal] not be so reduced at such time if the amount of such reduction would be an amount less
than $0.01, but any such amount shall be carried forward and reduction with respect thereto
made at the time of and together with any subsequent reduction which, together with such
amount and any other amount or amounts so carried forward, shall aggregate $0.01 or more.

(iv) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this Section 4(d),
the consideration received by the Company for the issue of any Additional Shares of Common
Stock shall be computed as follows:

(A) — Cash and Property. Such consideration shall:

(1) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
aggregate amount of cash received by the Company excluding amounts paid or payable for
accrued interest or accrued dividends;

(2) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be

computed at the fair value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors; and

LA_DOCS\777045 10(W2000]
(3) in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock are
issued together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Company for consideration
which covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in
clauses (1) and (2) above, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(B) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per
share received by the Company for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been
issued pursuant to Section 4(d)(ii)(A), relating to Options and Convertible Securities, shall be
determined by dividing:

(1) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the
Company as consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the
minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating
thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such
consideration) payable to the Company upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the
exercise of such Options for Convertible Secunties and the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities, by

(2) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as
set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for
a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities.

(v) Adjustments for Subdivisions, Combinations or Consolidation of
Common Stock. In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided (by
stock split, or otherwise), into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, each Conversion
Price then in effect shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such subdivision, be
proportionately decreased. In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be
combined or consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of
Common Stock, each Conversion Price then in effect shal], concurrently with the effectiveness
of such combination or consolidation, be proportionately increased.

(v1) Adjustments for Other Distributions. In the event the Company at
any time or from time to time makes, or fixes a record date for the determination of holders of
Common Stock entitled to receive any distribution payable in securities of the Company other
than shares of Common Stock and other than as otherwise adjusted in this Section 4(d), then and
in each such event provision shall be made so that the holders of Preferred Stock shall receive
upon conversion thereof, in addition to the number of shares of Common Stock receivable
thereupon, the amount of securities of the Company which they would have received had their
Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event and had they
thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to and including the date of conversion,
retained such secunties receivable by them as aforesaid during such period, subject to all other
adjustments called for during such period under this Section 4(d) with respect to the rights of the
holders of the Preferred Stock.

14

LA_DOCS\777045.10[/W2000]
(vii) Adjustments for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. Uf
the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be changed into the
same or a different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock, whether by capital
reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares
provided for above), each Conversion Price then in effect shall, concurrently with the effective-
ness of such reorganization or reclassification, be proportionately adjusted such that the
Preferred Stock shall be convertible into, in lieu of the number of shares of Common Stock
which the holders would otherwise have been entitled to receive, a number of shares of such
other class or classes of stock equivalent to the number of shares of Common Stock that would
have been subject to receipt by the holders upon conversion of the Preferred Stock immediately
before that change.

(vii) Reorganization, Mergers, Consolidations, or Sales of Assets. To
the extent that Section 3 hereof does not apply or the holders of Preferred Stock waive their
rights under Section 3, if at any time or from time to time, there shall be a capilal reorganization
of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision, combination, reclassification, or exchange of
shares provided for elsewhere in this Section 4) or a merger or consolidation of the Company
with or into another corporation, or the sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s
properties and assets to any other person, then, as a part of such reorganization, merger,
consolidation, or sale, provision shall be made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock shall
thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of the Preferred Stock held by them, the number
of shares of stock or other securities or property of the Company, or of the successor Company
resulting from such merger or consolidation or sale, to which a holder of Common Stock
deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled upon such capital reorganization, merger,
consolidation, or sale. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application
of the provisions of this Section 4 with respect to the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock
after the reorganization, merger, consolidation, or sale to the end that the provisions of this
Section 4 (including adjustment of each Conversion Price then in effect and the number of shares
purchasable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event as nearly
equivalent as may be practicable.

(¢) No Impairment. The Company will not, by amendment of its Certificate
of Incorporation or through any reorganization, recapitalization, transfer of assets, merger,
consolidation, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seck
to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed
hereunder by the Company but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the
provisions of this Section 4 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or
appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock against
impairment.

(f) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of cach adjustment or
readjustment of any Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4, the Company at its expense
shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and
furnish to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or
readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is
based. The Company shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of Preferred
Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such

15

LA_DOCS\777045.10[W2000]
adjustments and readjustments, (ii) the applicable Conversion Price at the time in effect, and
(iii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at
the time would be received upon the conversion of Preferred Stock.

(g) Notices of Record Date. In the event that the Company shall propose at
any time:

i) to declare any dividend or distribution upon its Common Stock,
whether in cash, property, stock or other securities, whether or not a regular cash dividend and
whether or not out of earnings or earned surplus;

(ii) to offer for subscription pro rata to the holders of any class or
series of its stock any additional shares of stock of any class or series or any other securities or
property, or to receive any other rights;

(iii) to effect any reclassification or recapitalization of its Common
Stock outstanding involving a change in the Common Stock; or

(iv) to merge with or into any other corporation, or sell, lease or convey
all or substantially all its property or business, or to liquidate, dissolve or wind up, including
without limitation, any deemed liquidation events as defined in Section 3(d) above;

then, in connection with each such event, this Company shall send to the holders of the Preferred
Stock at least 30 days’ prior written notice of the date on which a record shall be taken for such
dividend, distribution or subscription rights (and specifying the date on which the holders of
Common Stock shall be entitled thereto) or for determining rights to vote in respect of the
matters referred to in (iii) and (iv) above. With regard to the matters referenced in (iii) and (iv)
above, such written notice shall describe the material terms and conditions of the proposed
transaction and the Company shall thereafter give such holders prompt notice of any material
changes. The transaction shall in no event take place sooner than 30 days after the Company has
given the first notice provided for herein or sooner than 10 days after the Company has given
notice of any material changes provided for herein; provided, however, that such periods may be
shortened upon the written consent of the holders of the Preferred Stock that are entitled to such
notice rights or similar notice nights and that represent at least a majority of the voting power of
all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, voting together as single class.

Each such written notice shall be given as provided in Section 7 below.

times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock
solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock, such
number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, the Company will take such corporate
action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose,

19
LA_DOCS\777045.10[W2000}
Redemption Election”) from the holders of not less than a majority of the then outstanding
Series B Preferred Stock that the shares of such series be redeemed, the Company shall redeem
at the applicable Series B Redemption Price (as defined below), to the extent it may lawfully do
so, the Series B Preferred Stock in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 6 by

Price’). The redemption price for each share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock repurchased shall be

Redemption Date to which such calculation applies). Shares subject to redemption pursuant to
this Section 6 shall be redeemed from each holder of Preferred Stock on a pro rata basis.

(c) Procedure. Within fifteen (15) days following its receipt of the Series B
Redemption Election or Series Preferred Redemption Election, the Company shall mail a written
notice, first class postage prepaid, to each holder of record (at the close of business on the
business day next preceding the day on which notice is given) of Series B Preferred Stock and
Series Preferred Stock at the address last shown on the records of the Company for such holder,
notifying such holder of the redemption to be effected, specifying the number of shares to be
redeemed from such holder, the dates of each Series B Redemption Date or Series Preferred
Redemption Date, as applicable, the applicable Series B Redemption Price or Series Preferred
Redemption Price (each, a “Redemption Price”), the place at which payment may be obtained
and calling upon such holder to surrender to the Company, in the manner and at the place

such shares shall be payable to the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or
certificates as the owner thereof and each surrendered certificate shall be canceled. In the event
less than all the shares represented by any such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall
be issued representing the unredeemed shares.

(d) Effect of Redemption; Insufficient Funds. From and after each Series B
Redemption Date or Series Preferred Redemption Date, as applicable, unless there shall have
been a default in payment of the Series B Redemption Price or Series Preferred Redemption

applicable (except the right to receive the applicable Redemption Price without interest upon
surrender of their certificate or certificates), shall cease with respect to the shares redeemed on
such Series B Redemption Date or Series Preferred Redemption Date, and such shares shal] not
thereafter be transferred on the books of the Company or be deemed to be outstanding for any
purpose whatsoever. If the funds of the Company legally available for redemption of shares of
Series B Preferred Stock or Series Preferred Stock on any Series B Redemption Date or Series
Preferred Redemption Date, as applicable, are insufficient to redeem the total number of shares
of Series B Preferred Stock or Series Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such date, those funds
which are legally available will be used to redeem the maximum possible number of such shares

Redemption Price or Series Preferred Redemption Price applicable to each such holder’s shares
of Series B Preferred Stock or Series Preferred Stock which are subject to redemption on such
Series B Redemption Date or Series Preferred Redemption Date, as applicable. The shares of
Series B Preferred Stock or Series Preferred Stock not redeemed shall remain outstanding and
entitled to all the rights and preferences provided herein. At any time thereafter when additional
funds of the Company are legally available for the redemption of shares of Series B Preferred
Stock or Series Preferred Stock, such funds will immediately be used to redeem the balance of
the shares which the Company has become obliged to redeem on any Series B Redemption Date
or Series Preferred Redemption Date, as applicable, but which it has not redeemed.

Series Preferred Redemption Date, as applicable, the Company shall deposit the Series B

or Series Preferred Stock, as applicable, designated for redemption on such Scries B Redemption
Date or Series Preferred Redemption Date, and not yet redeemed or converted, with a bank or
