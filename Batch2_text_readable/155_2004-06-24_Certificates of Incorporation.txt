The following is a statement of the designations and the powers, privileges and rights,
and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof in respect of each class of capital stock

A. COMMON STOCK

1. General. The voting, dividend and liquidation rights of the holders of the
Common Stock are subject to and qualified by the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock as
may be designated by the Board of Directors upon any issuance of the Preferred Stock of any
series

2. Voting. The holders of the Common Stock are entitled to one vote for
each share of Common Stock held at all meetings of stockholders (and written actions in lieu of
meetings). There shall be no cumulative voting.

3, Number of Shares. The number of authorized shares of Common Stock
may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by
the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote,
irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.

4, Dividends. Dividends may be declared and paid on the Common Stock
from funds lawfully available therefor if, as and when determined by the Board of Directors and
subject to any preferential dividend rights of any then outstanding Preferred Stock.

5. Liguidation. Upon the dissolution or liquidation of the Corporation,
whether voluntary or involuntary, holders of Common Stock will be entitled to receive all assets
of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders, subject to any preferential rights
of any then outstanding Preferred Stock.

B. Preferred Stock.

1. Dividends. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive,
in preference to the holders of the Junior Stock (as defined in Section 2(a) below), out of funds
legally available therefor, if, as and when declared by the Corporation’s Board of Directors,
dividends annually at a rate equal to the greater of (i) eight percent (8%) per annum and (ii) the
dividends payable on the Common Stock on a pari passu, as converted basis (the “Dividend
Rate”). Such dividends on each share of Preferred Stock shall be payable in cash at the Dividend
Rate on the purchase price paid to the Corporation by the initial holder of each such share.
Unless all declared dividends on the Preferred Stock shall have been paid or a sum sufficient for
the payment thereof set apart, no dividend shall be paid or declared, and no distribution shall be
made, on any Junior Stock and no redemption of any Junior Stock shall occur. Except as
otherwise provided herein, if at any time the Corporation pays less than the total amount of

2
401 54750vS
dividends then declared but unpaid with respect to the Preferred Stock, such payment shall be
distributed ratably among the holders of Preferred Stock based upon the aggregate number of
shares of Preferred Stock held by each such holder. Upon any conversion of shares of Preferred
Stock, all rights to such preferential dividends on such shares shall terminate.

2. Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up.

(a) In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution
or winding up of the Corporation, the holders of shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding shall
be entitled to be paid out of the assets and funds of the Corporation available for distribution to
its stockholders, before any payment shall be made to the holders of Common Stock or any other
class or series of stock ranking on liquidation junior to the Preferred Stock (such Common Stock
and other stock being collectively referred to as “Junior Stock”) by reason of their ownership
thereof, the amount determined pursuant to subsections (b), (c), (d) or (e) below as applicable
(with all per share calculations required in this Section 2 subject to appropriate adjustment in the
event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization affecting
such shares), plus any dividends declared but unpaid on such shares, based on a per share amount
(the “Initial Calculation”) determined by dividing the value of such assets and funds of the
Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders by the total number of shares of
Common Stock then outstanding, calculated in all cases assuming conversion of all Preferred
Stock into Common Stock.

(b) If the Initial Calculation is greater than or equal to $2.76 per share
(two times $1.38, the original purchase price per share of the Series B-1 Preferred Stock), then
the total amount of assets and funds of the Corporation available for distribution to its
stockholders (such total amount, the “Total Distributable Amount”) shall be distributed among
the holders of shares of Preferred Stock, Common Stock and any other class or series of stock
entitled to participate in liquidation distributions with the holders of Common Stock, pro rata
based on the number of shares of Common Stock held by each (assuming conversion into
Common Stock of all such shares of Preferred Stock).

(c) If the Initial Calculation is less than $1.50 per share (two times
$0.75, the original purchase price per share of the Series A Preferred Stock), then the holders of
the Series A Preferred Stock shali receive the Series A Distribution Amount (as defined below),
the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock shall receive the Series B Distribution Amount (as
defined below) and the holders of the Series B-1 Preferred Stock shall receive the Series B-1
Distribution Amount (as defined below), up to a maximum amount per share equal to the original
purchase price per share paid to the Corporation by the initial holders of each of the Series A
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series B-1 Preferred Stock therefor ($0.75 per
share for shares of Series A Preferred Stock, $1.175 per share for shares of Series B Preferred
Stock and $1.38 per share for shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock), pro rata based on the
number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series B-1 Preferred
Stock held by each such holder (assuming conversion into Common Stock of all such shares of
Preferred Stock):

“Series A Distribution Amount” = TDA x Al x A2
(Al x A2) + (BI x B2) + (B-1-1 x B-1-2)

4UTS4750v5
“Series B Distribution Amount” = TDA x Bl x B2
(Al x A2) + (B1 x B2) + (B-1-1 x B-1-2)

“Series B-1 Distribution Amount” = TDA x B-1-1 x B-1-2
(Al x A2) + (BI x B2) + (B-1-1 x B-1-2)

For purposes of the foregoing formulas and the formulas in subsection (d)(x) below:
TDA = Total Distributable Amount

Al =Number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding (assuming conversion
into Common Stock of all such shares of Series A Preferred Stock)

A2.  =§.75, which is the original purchase price per share of Series A Preferred Stock

Bl =Number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding (assuming conversion
into Common Stock of all such shares of Series B Preferred Stock)

B2 = $1.175, which is the original purchase price per share of Series B Preferred Stock

B-1-l=Number of shares of Series B-l Preferred Stock outstanding (assuming
conversion into common stock of all such shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock)

B-1-2=$1.38, which is the original purchase price per share of Series B-1 Preferred Stock

Thereafter the remaining assets and funds of the Corporation available for distribution to its
stockholders shall be distributed among the holders of shares of Preferred Stock, Common Stock
and any other class or series of stock entitled to participate in liquidation distributions with the
holders of Common Stock, pro rata based on the number of shares of Common Stock held by
each such holder (assuming conversion into Common Stock of all such shares of Preferred
Stock).

(d) If the Initial Calculation is (i) greater than or equal to $1.50 per
share {two times $0.75, the original purchase price per share of the Series A Preferred Stock) and
(11) less than $2.76 per share (two times $1.38, the original purchase price per share of the Series
B-1 Preferred Stock), then the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall receive the Series A
Distribution Amount, the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock shal! receive the Series B
Distribution Amount and the holders of the Series B-1 Preferred Stock shall receive the
Series B-1 Distribution Amount, up to a maximum amount per share equal to the original
purchase price per share paid to the Corporation by the initial holders of each of the Series A
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series B-! Preferred Stock therefor ($0.75 per
share for shares of Series A Preferred Stock, $1.175 per share for shares of Series B Preferred
Stock and $1.38 for shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock), pro rata based on the number of
shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series B-1 Preferred Stock held
by each such holder (assuming conversion into Common Stock of all such shares of Preferred
Stock). Thereafter, any remaining assets and funds of the Corporation available for distribution
to its stockholders shall be distributed:

AO S475005
(x) first, among the holders of shares of Preferred Stock,
Common Stock and any other class or series of stock entitled to participate in liquidation
distributions with the holders of Common Stock, pro rata based on the number of shares of
Common Stock held by each such holder (assuming conversion into Common Stock of all such
shares of Preferred Stock); provided that such amount collectively distributed among the holders
of Preferred Stock (the “Remaining Preferred Amount”) shall be allocated follows: the holders of
the Series A Preferred Stock shall receive the Series A Remaining Amount (as defined below),
the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock shall receive the Series B Remaining Amount (as
defined below) and the holders of the Series B-1 Preferred Stock shall receive the Series B-1
Remaining Amount (as defined below), up to a maximum amount per share (including all
amounts received by a holder of a share of Preferred Stock pursuant to this subsection (d)) equal
to twice the original purchase price per share paid to the Corporation by the initial holders of
each of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series B-1 Preferred Stock
therefor ($1.50 per share for shares of Series A Preferred Stock, $2.35 per share for shares of
Series B Preferred Stock and $2.76 per share for shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock), pro rata
based on the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series
B-1 Preferred Stock held by cach such holder (assuming conversion into Common Stock of all
such shares of Preferred Stock).

“Series A Remaining Amount” = Remaining
Preferred Amount x Al x A2
(Al x A2)+(B1 x B2) + (B-1-1 x B-1-2)
“Serics B Remaining Amount” = Remaining
Preferred Amount x Bi x B2
(Al x A2)+ (BI x B2) + (B-1-1 x B-1-2)
‘Series B-1 Remaining Amount = Remaining
Preferred Amount” x B-1-1 x B-1-2
(Al x A2)+(B1 x B2) + (B-1-1 x B-1-2)

(y) next, any remaining assets and funds of the Corporation
available for distribution to its stockholders shall be distributed among the holders of shares of
Common Stock and any other class or series of stock (excluding the Preferred Stock) entitled to
participate in liquidation distributions with the holders of Common Stock, pro rata based on the
number of shares of Common Stock held by each (assuming conversion into Common Stock of
all such shares of any other class or series of stock).

(e) If upon any such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation, the remaining assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders
shall be insufficient to pay to each of the holders of Preferred Stock an amount at least equal to
the original purchase price paid to the Corporation by the initial holder of such Preferred Stock,
then the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall receive the Series A Distribution Amount,
the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock shall receive the Series B Distribution Amount and
the holders of the Series B-1 Preferred Stock shall receive the Series B-1 Distribution Amount,
pro rata based on the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and
Series B-1 Preferred Stock held by each such holder (assuming conversion into Common Stock
of all such shares of Preferred Stock).

40154 750v5
(f) In the event of any merger or consolidation of the Corporation into
or with another corporation (except one in which the holders of capital stock of the Corporation
immediately prior to such merger or consolidation continue to hold at least seventy percent
(70%) by voting power of the capital stock of the surviving corporation), or the sale of all or
substantially all the assets of the Corporation, if the holders of at least fifty percent (50%) of the
then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock so elect by giving written notice thereof to the
Corporation at least three days before the effective date of such event, then such merger,
consolidation or asset sale shall be deemed to be a liquidation of the Corporation, and all
consideration payable to the stockholders of the Corporation (in the case of a merger or
consolidation) or all consideration payable to the Corporation, together with all other available
assets of the Corporation (in the case of an asset sale), shall be distributed to the holders of
capital stock of the Corporation in accordance with Sections 2(a) through 2(e) above. The
Corporation shall promptly provide to the holders of shares of Preferred Stock such information
concerning the terms of such merger, consolidation or asset sale and the value of the assets of the
Corporation as may reasonably be requested by the holders of Preferred Stock in order to assist
them in determining whether to make such an election. If the holders of the Preferred Stock
make such an election, the Corporation shall use its best efforts to amend the agreement or plan
of merger or consolidation to adjust the rate at which the shares of capital stock of the
Corporation are converted into or exchanged for cash, new securities or other property to give
effect to such election. The amount deemed distributed to the holders of Preferred Stock upon
any such merger or consolidation shall be the cash or the value of the property, rights or
securities distributed to such holders by the acquiring person, firm or other entity. The value of
such property, rights or other securities shall be determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors of the Corporation. If no notice of the election permitted by this Section 2(f) is given,
the provisions of Section 4(i) below shall apply.

3. Voting. Each holder of outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of whole shares of Common Stock into
which the shares of Preferred Stock held by such holder are then convertible (as adjusted from
time to time pursuant to Section 4 hereof), at each meeting of stockholders of the Corporation
{and written actions of stockholders in lieu of meetings) with respect to any and all matters
presented to the stockholders of the Corporation for their action or consideration. Except as
provided by law, by the provisions of Section 7 below or by the provisions establishing any other
series of preferred stock, holders of Preferred Stock and of any other outstanding series of
preferred stock shall vote together with the holders of Common Stock as a single class.

4. Optional Conversion.

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be
convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time and from time to time, and without
the payment of additional consideration by the holder thereof, into such number of fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Original Issue Price (as
defined below) by the Conversion Price (as defined below) in effect at the time of conversion.
The “Original Issue Price” shall be $0.75 per share for the Series A Preferred Stock, $1.175 per
share for the Series B Preferred Stock and $1.38 per share for the Series B-1 Preferred Stock.
The initial “Conversion Price” shall be $0.75 per share for the Series A Preferred Stock, $1.175
per share for the Series B Preferred Stock and $1.38 per share for the Series B-1 Preferred Stock.

4015475005
Such initial Conversion Price, and the rate at which shares of Preferred Stock may be converted
into shares of Common Stock, shall be subject to adjustment as provided below.

In the event of a notice of redemption of any shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to
Section 6 hereof, the conversion rights of the shares designated for redemption shall terminate at
the close of business on the fifth full day preceding the date fixed for redemption, unless the
redemption price is not paid when due, in which case the conversion rights for such shares shall
continue until such price is paid in full. In the event of a liquidation of the Corporation, the
conversion nghts shall terminate at the close of business on the first full day immediately
preceding the date fixed for the payment of any amounts distributable on liquidation to the
holders of Preferred Stock.

(b) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be
issued upon conversion of the Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the
holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay to such holder an amount equal to
such fraction multiplied by the then effective Conversion Price.

{c) Mechanics of Conversion.

(i) If a holder of Preferred Stock elects to convert shares of
Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock pursuant to subsection (a) above, such holder shall
surrender the certificates or certificates for such shares of Preferred Stock at the principal office
of the Corporation together with written notice that such holder elects to convert all or any
number of the shares of the Preferred Stock represented by such certificate or certificates. Such
notice shall state such holder’s name or the names of the nominees in which such holder wishes
the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued and the effective date of
the conversion (the “Conversion Date”), which may be any date within the 60-day period
following the date on which such notice is received by the Corporation. If required by the
Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by a
written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly
executed by the registered holder or such holder’s attorney duly authorized in writing. The
converting holder shall be deemed to be the record holder of the resulting shares of Common
Stock on the Conversion Date and the Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after the
Conversion Date (and in any event within fifteen (15) business days), issue and deliver at such
office of such holder of Preferred Stock, or to such holder’s nominees, a certificate or certificates
for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled, together with
payment in lieu of any fraction of a share pursuant to Section 4(b) above.

(ii) | The Corporation shall at all times when the Preferred Stock
shall be outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued stock, for the
purpose of effecting the conversion of the Preferred Stock, such number of its duly authorized
shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all
outstanding Preferred Stock. Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment
reducing the Conversion Price below the then par value of the shares of Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation will, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary

40154750v5
in order that the Corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion Price.

(iii) Upon any such conversion, no adjustment to the
Conversion Price shall be made for any declared or accrued but unpaid dividends on the
Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion or on the Common Stock delivered upon conversion.

(iv) On the Conversion Date, all shares of Preferred Stock
which shall have been surrendered for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed
to be outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares, including the rights, if any, to receive
notices and to vote, shall immediately cease and terminate, except only the right of the holders
thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor and payment of any dividends
declared but unpaid thereon. Any shares of Preferred Stock so converted shall be retired and
cancelled and shall not be reissued, and the Corporation (without the need for stockholder action)
may from thereafter take such appropriate action as may be necessary to reduce the authorized
Preferred Stock accordingly.

(v) The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and other taxes
{other than taxes based on income) that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of
shares of Common Stock upon conversion of shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section
4 The Corporation shall not, however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in
respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a
name other than that in which the shares of Preferred Stock so converted were registered, and no
such issuance or delivery shall be made unless and until the person or entity requesting such
issuance has paid to the Corporation the amount of any such tax or has established, to the
satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax has been paid.

(d) Adjustment for Dilution. If at any time after the date of the filing
of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware (the “Filing Date”), the Corporation shall issue any shares of Common Stock, or
shall issue any Common Stock Equivalents (as hereinafter defined), for a consideration per share
less than the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Common Stock
or Common Stock Equivalents, the Conversion Price of such share of Preferred Stock in effect
immediately prior to each such issuance shall be decreased to the amount determined in
accordance with the following formula:

Conversion Price = (PI x Ql) + (P2 x Q2)
Q1+Q2

For purposes of the foregoing formula:
Pt= Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance.

Ql] = Number of shares of Common Stock deemed outstanding (in accordance with
subparagraph (vi) below) immediately prior to such issuance.

P2= Average price per share received by the Corporation upon such issuance
(determined in accordance with subparagraphs (iii) and (vi) below).

8
40154750v5
Q2 = Number of shares of Common Stock issued or sold, or deemed to have been
issued or sold (in accordance with subparagraph (vi) below) upon such issuance.

For purpose of any adjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4(d), the
following provisions shall be applicable:

(i) “Common Stock Equivalents” means any stock or security
convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock and any right, warrant or
option to acquire Common Stock or any such convertible, exercisable or exchangeable security.

(ii) The per share consideration for the sale or issuance of
Common Stock shall be the price per share received by the Corporation before payment of
commissions, discounts and other expenses. The value of any non-cash consideration received
or receivable upon the sale or issuance of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents shall be
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

(iii) In the case of the sale or issuance of Common Stock
Equivalents, the per share consideration shall be determined by dividing the maximum number
of shares of Common Stock issuable with respect to such Common Stock Equivalents into the
aggregate consideration received by the Corporation upon the sale or issuance of such Common
Stock Equivalents plus the minimum aggregate amount of any additional consideration
teceivable by the Corporation upon the conversion or exercise of such Common Stock
Equivalents. For the purpose of calculation, such maximum number of shares shall be assumed
to be issued on the earlier of the payment date or record date for a distribution of such Common
Stock Equivalents.

(iv) If any Common Stock Equivalents included in adjustments
under this Section 4(d) expire or terminate without the Common Stock to which they related
having been issued, the Conversion Price shall be readjusted to eliminate the effect of the
assumed issuance of such Common Stock. If any Common Stock Equivalents by their terms
provide for subsequent increases in the additional consideration payable for the related Common
Stock or for subsequent decreases in the number of shares of Common Stock obtainable, then,
upon any such increase or decrease, the Conversion Price shall be appropriately readjusted to the
extent such Common Stock Equivalents have not then expired or been exercised or converted.
The aggregate increase in the Conversion Price caused by all such readjustments shall not exceed
the decrease in Conversion Price made upon the issuance of the Common Stock Equivalents to
which such readjustments relates. If any Common Stock Equivalents by their terms provide for
subsequent decreases in the additional consideration payable for the related Common Stock or
for subsequent increases in the number of shares of Common Stock obtainable, then, upon any
such decrease or increase, the Conversion Price shall be appropriately adjusted to the extent such
Common Stock Equivalents have not then expired or been exercised or converted.

(v) In case the Corporation shall declare a dividend or make
any other distribution upon any stock of the Corporation payable in Common Stock or Common
Stock Equivalents, such Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents shall be deemed to have
been issued or sold without consideration as of the earlier of the related record or payment date.

40154750v5
(vi) | The number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any
point in time shall include all shares then issuable or to become issuable pursuant to any
Common Stock Equivalent then issued or to be issued.

(vii) The following issuances of Common Stock or Common
Stock Equivalents shall be excluded from the adjustment of the Conversion Price under this
Section 4(d): (1) any dividend or distribution on any Preferred Stock; (2) any stock for which
adjustment of the Conversion Price is made pursuant to Sections 4(e), 4(f), 4(g)or 4(h) below;
(3) securities offered by the Corporation to the public in a Qualified Public Offering (as defined
in Section 5(a) below); (4) securities reissued to directors, employees, or consultants following
the Corporation’s acquisition of such securities pursuant to restricted stock arrangements with
individuals who have terminated their relationship with the Corporation or shares subject to
options granted to individuals who have terminated their relationship with the Corporation which
are not exercised; (5) securities issued solely in consideration for the acquisition or licensing of
technology (including, without limitation, sponsored research) by the Corporation or to a
collaborative partner of the Corporation in connection with a corporate partnering transaction, if
approved by the Board of Directors; (6) securities issued pursuant to any right or agreement to
the extent to which an adjustment was previously made to the Conversion Price established by
this Section 4 with respect to the initial sale or grant by the Corporation of such right or
agreement, (7) all securities issued or issuable pursuant to warrants outstanding on the Filing
Date, and (8) shares of Common Stock (“Option Shares”) issued or issuable upon exercise of
stock options (“Options”) granted to directors, officers, employees and consultants of the
Corporation under the Corporation’s 2002 Incentive and Non-Incentive Stock Option Plan (the
“Plan”) approved by the Board of Directors and adopted by the stockholders, whether previously
existing or granted after the Filing Date, each of which Options has a per share exercise price
that is not less than the per share fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of the
Option grant, and which number of Option Shares does not exceed an aggregate of 1,235,000
shares of Common Stock.

(e) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If the Corporation

shall at any time or from time to time after the Filing Date effect a subdivision of the outstanding
Common Stock, the Conversion Price then in effect immediately before that subdivision shall be
proportionately decreased. If the Corporation shall at any time or from time to time after the
Filing Date effect a subdivision of the Preferred Stock, the Conversion Price with respect to the
Preferred Stock then in effect immediately before that subdivision shall be proportionately
increased. If the Corporation shall at any time or from time to time after the Filing Date combine
the outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price then in effect immediately before
the combination shall be proportionately increased. If the Corporation shall at any time or from
time to time after the Filing Date combine the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, the
Conversion Price with respect to the Preferred Stock then in effect immediately before the
combination shall be proportionately decreased. Any adjustment under this paragraph shall
become effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes
effective.

(f) Adjustment for Certain Dividends and Distributions. In the event

the Corporation at any time, or from time to time after the Filing Date shall make or issue, or fix
a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or

10
40154750v5
other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock, then and in each such event the
Conversion Price for the Preferred Stock then in effect shall be decreased as of the time of such
issuance or, in the event such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on
such record date, by multiplying the Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction:

(1) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares
of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance
or the close of business on such record date, and

(2) the denominator of which shall be the total number of
shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such
issuance or the close of business on such record date plus the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution;

provided, however, if such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend is not fully paid
or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the Conversion Price for the
Preferred Stock shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record date
and thereafter the Conversion Price for the Preferred Stock shall be adjusted pursuant to this
paragraph as of the time of actual payment of such dividends or distributions; and provided
further, however, that no such adjustment shall be made if the holders of Preferred Stock
simultaneously receive a dividend or other distribution of shares of Common Stock in a number
equal to the number of shares of Common Stock as they would have received if all outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event.

(g) Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. In the event
the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Filing Date shall make or issue, or fix a
record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or
other distribution payable in securities of the Corporation other than shares of Common Stock,
then and in each such event provision shall be made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock
shall receive upon conversion thereof in addition to the number of shares of Common Stock
receivable thereupon, the amount of securities of the Corporation that they would have received
had the Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event and had
they thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to and including the conversion
date, retained such securities receivable by them as aforesaid during such period, giving
application to all adjustments called for during such period under this paragraph with respect to
the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock; and provided further, however, that no such
adjustment shall be made if the holders of Preferred Stock simultaneously receive a dividend or
other distribution of such securities in an amount equal to the amount of such securities as they
would have received if all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock had been converted into
Common Stock on the date of such event.

(h) Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange, or Substitution. If the
Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be changed into the
same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by capital
reorganization, reclassification, or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination or shares
or stock dividend provided for above, or a reorganization, merger, consolidation, or sale of assets
provided for below), then and in each such event the holder of each such share of Preferred Stock

11
401547505
shall have the right thereafter to convert such share into the kind and amount of shares of stock
and other securities and property receivable upon such reorganization, reclassification, or other
change by holders of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Preferred
Stock might have been converted immediately prior to such reorganization, reclassification, or
change, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein.

(i) Adjustment for Merger or Reorganization. In case of any
consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into another corporation or the sale of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Corporation to another corporation (other than a
consolidation, merger or sale which is covered by Section 2(f) above), each share of Preferred
Stock shall thereafter be convertible (or shall be converted into a security which shall be
convertible) into the kind and amount of shares of stock or other securities or property to which a
holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation deliverable upon
conversion of such Preferred Stock would have been entitled upon such consolidation, merger or
sale; and, in such case, appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors) shall be made in the application of the provisions in this Section 4 set forth with
respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the holders of the Preferred Stock, to the end that
the provisions set forth in this Section 4 (including provisions with respect to changes in and
other adjustments of the Conversion Price) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably
may be, in relation to any shares of stock or other property thereafter deliverable upon the
conversion of the Preferred Stock.

(j) No Impairment. The Corporation will not, by amendment of its
Certificate of Incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation,
merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to
avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder
by the Corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the
provisions of this Section 4 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or
appropriate in order to protect the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock pursuant to this
Section 4 against impairment.

(k) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each
adjustment or readjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation at
its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the
terms hereof and furnish to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such
adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or
readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon the written request at any time (but not more
than twice in any 12 month period) of any holder of shares representing at least 5% of the
authorized number of shares of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a
similar certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and readjustments, (ii) the Conversion Price
then in effect, and (iii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other
property which then would be received upon the conversion of Preferred Stock.

5, Mandatory Conversion.
(a) Upon the closing (the “Mandatory Conversion Date”) of the sale

by the Corporation of shares of Common Stock in a firm commitment, underwritten public

12
40§54750v5
offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, through a firm acceptable to the Board of Directors of the Corporation at a price per
share of Common Stock equal to at least two times the Conversion Price then applicable to the
Series B-1 Preferred Stock (with such Conversion Price for this purpose initially equal to $1.38)
(appropriately adjusted to reflect the occurrence of any event described m Section 4) and
resulting in at least $15,000,000 of gross proceeds to the Corporation (before deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses) (a “Qualified Public Offering”),
all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of
Common Stock at the then effective Conversion Price.

(b) All holders of record of shares of Preferred Stock will be given ten
(10) business days prior written notice of the Mandatory Conversion Date and the place
designated for mandatory conversion of all such shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this
Section 5. Such notice shall be sent both by facsimile transmission (if a facsimile number has
been provided and is operational) and by first-class or registered mail, postage prepaid, to each
record holder of Preferred Stock at such holder’s facsimile number and address last shown on the
records of the Corporation for the Preferred Stock. Upon receipt of such notice, each holder of
shares of Preferred Stock shal! surrender his, her or its certificate or certificates for all such
shares to the Corporation at the place designated in such notice, and shall thereafter receive
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to this Section 5. On the Mandatory Conversion Date, all rights with respect to the Preferred
Stock so converted, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and vote, will terminate,
except only the rights of the holders thereof, upon surrender of their certificate or certificates
therefor, to receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which such
Preferred Stock has been converted. If so required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered
for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by written instrument or instruments of
transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or by
such holder’s attorney duly authorized in writing. As soon as practicable after the Mandatory
Conversion Date and the surrender of the certificate or certificates for Preferred Stock, the
Corporation shall cause to be issued and delivered to such holder, or on his, her or its written
order, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable on
such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof and cash as provided in Section 4(b) in
respect of any fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion.

(c) All certificates evidencing shares of Preferred Stock which are
required to be surrendered for conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof shall, from
and after the Mandatory Conversion Date, be deemed to have been retired and cancelled and the
shares of Preferred Stock represented thereby converted into Common Stock for all purposes,
notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender such certificates on or
prior to such date. The Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate action (without the
need for stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized Preferred Stock
accordingly.

6. Redemption Event.

(a) The Corporation will, subject to the conditions set forth below, on
December 14, 2007 and on each of the first and second anniversaries thereof (each such date

13
4055475605
being referred to hereinafter as a “Redemption Date”), upon receipt of written request(s) (an
“Initial Redemption Request”) for redemption not less than thirty (30) days prior to the
applicable Redemption Date from holders of at least a simple majority of the shares of Series A
Preferred Stock, making demand as a separate class, or from holders of a at least a simple
majority of the combined shares of Series B Preferred Stock and of Series B-1 Preferred Stock,
calculated as a single class and making demand as a separate class (such demanding holders of
Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock and Series B-1 Preferred Stock, the “Initial
Requesting Holders”), redeem from each Requesting Holder (as defined in Section 6(c) below),
at the price per share equal to the price per share paid to the Corporation for such shares by the
initial holders thereof, which in the case of the Series A Preferred Stock is $0.75 per share, in the
case of the Series B Preferred Stock is $1.175 per share and in the case of the Series B-1
Preferred Stock is $1.38 per share, subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock
dividend, stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization affecting such shares, plus any
dividends declared or accrued but unpaid thereon (the “Redemption Price”), the following
respective portions of the number of shares of Preferred Stock held by such holder on the
applicable Redemption Date:

Portion of Shares of Preferred

Redemption Date Stock to be Redeemed
December 14, 2007 33 1/3%
December 14, 2008 66 2/3%
December 14, 2009 100%

(b) If the funds of the Corporation legally available for redemption of
Preferred Stock on any Redemption Date are insufficient to redeem all of the number of shares of
Preferred Stock required under this Section 6 to be redeemed on such date, those funds which are
legally available will be used to redeem the maximum possible number of such shares of
Preferred Stock ratably on the basis of the number of shares of Preferred Stock which would be
redeemed on such date if the funds of the Corporation legally available therefor had been
sufficient to redeem all shares of Preferred Stock required to be redeemed on such date. At any
time thereafter when additional funds of the Corporation become legally available for the
redemption of Preferred Stock, such funds will be used, at the end of the next succeeding fiscal
quarter, to redeem the balance of the shares which the Corporation was theretofore obligated to
redeem, ratably on the basis set forth in the preceding sentence.

(c) The Corporation shall provide notice of its receipt of an Initial
Redemption Request, specifying the time, manner and place of redemption and the Redemption
Price (a “Redemption Notice”), by first-class or registered mail, postage prepaid, to each holder
of record of the same series of Preferred Stock as the Initial Requesting Holders, at the address
for such holders last shown on the records of the transfer agent therefor (or the records of the
Corporation, if it serves as its own transfer agent), not less than twenty (20) days prior to the
applicable Redemption Date. Each holder of record of the Series A Preferred Stock (if the Initial
Requesting Holders hold Series A Preferred Stock) or Series B Preferred Stock and Series B-1
Preferred Stock (if the Initial Requesting Hoiders hold Series B Preferred Stock or Series B-1
Preferred Stock) may elect to become, together with each of the Initial Requesting Holders, one

40: 5475005
of the “Requesting Holders” on such Redemption Date by so indicating in a written notice
mailed to the Corporation, by first-class or registered mail, postage prepaid, at least ten (10) days
prior to the applicable Redemption Date. Except as provided in Section 6(b) above, each
Requesting Holder shall surrender to the Corporation on the applicable Redemption Date the
certificate(s) representing the shares to be redeemed on such date, in the manner and at the place
designated in the Redemption Notice. Thereupon, the Redemption Price shall be paid to the
order of each such Requesting Holder and each certificate surrendered for redemption shall be
canceled. In the case less than all Preferred Stock represented by any certificate is redeemed in
any redemption pursuant to this Section 6, a new certificate will be issued representing the
unredeemed Preferred Stock without cost to the holder thereof.

(d) Unless there shall have been a default in payment of the applicable
Redemption Price, no share of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to any dividends declared after its
Redemption Date, and on such Redemption Date all rights of the holder of such share as a
stockholder of the Corporation by reason of the ownership of such share will cease, except the
right to receive the applicable Redemption Price of such share, without interest, upon
presentation and surrender of the certificate representing such share, and such share will not from
and after such Redemption Date be deemed to be outstanding.

7, Substantial Transactions Requiring Consent of Investors. In addition to

Section 3 and any vote which any series of preferred stock may have under Delaware law, so
long as any shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series B-1
Preferred Stock shall be outstanding, the Corporation shall not, without first obtaining the
affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of not less than fifty percent (50%) of the
outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series B-1

a sinking fund for such purposes) the Common Stock; provided, however, that this restriction

consultants or other persons performing services for the Corporation or any subsidiary pursuant
to agreements under which the Corporation has the option to repurchase such shares at cost or at
cost plus interest at a rate not to exceed nine percent (9%) per annum upon the occurrence of
certain events, such as the termination of employment, provided further, however, that the total
amount applied to the repurchase of shares of Common Stock shall not exceed $100,000 during
any twelve (12) month period;

certain Investors’ Rights Agreement between the Corporation and certain of its stockholders, as
amended, certain holders of Preferred Stock are each granted a right of first refusal to purchase
its pro rata share of any new securities (subject to certain exceptions) that the Corporation may,
from time to time, propose to issue or sell. Such right of first refusal shall terminate and be of no
further force or effect: (a) as to all such holders, upon and following the closing of a Qualified
Public Offering and (b) as to each such holder, upon and following the date on which such holder
no longer holds at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the shares of Preferred
Stock (including the shares of Common Stock upon conversion thereof) initially purchased by
such holder from the Corporation.

FIFTH: The Board of Directors shall have the power to adopt, amend or repeal the
By-Laws.

General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as the same may be amended and
supplemented, or by any successor thereto, indemnify any and all persons whom it shall have
power to indemnify under said Section from and against any and all of the expenses, liabilities or
other matters referred to in or covered by said Section. The Corporation shall advance expenses
to the fullest extent permitted by said Section. Such right to indemnification and advancement of
expenses shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent
and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. The
indemnification and advancement of expenses provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive
of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be
entitled under any By-law, agreement, vote or stockholders or disinterested directors or
otherwise.

EIGHTH: To the fullest extent that the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware, as it exists on the date hereof or as it may hereafter be amended, permits the limitation
